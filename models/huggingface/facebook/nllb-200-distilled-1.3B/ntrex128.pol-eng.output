Members of the Welsh Assembly are afraid of being called muppets.
Some members of the National Assembly were dismayed by the proposal to change their title to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP).
The idea was born out of plans to rename the assembly the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly from all sides of the political spectrum are worried about being ridiculed.
One Labour MP expressed his group's concerns, saying the new name rhymes with the Welsh words twp and pwp.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means fool and pwp means poop.
A Plaid Cymru politician said his group was "displeased" with the proposal and offered other solutions.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his party was open to a name change, but noted that the word "MWP" sounded very similar to "muppet".
In this case, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the letter u in the English dialect of Yorkshire.
The Assembly's committee, which is currently working on a bill to change the name, took the following position: Of course, the final decision on the future title of the Assembly members will be theirs.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the National Assembly for Wales the right to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposal.
The committee also supported the proposal to change the title of the Assembly Members to Member of the Welsh Parliament, or WMP in English, although this was the abbreviation MWP that was most popular with the public.
The Assembly members are proposing alternative solutions, and the difficulties in reaching a consensus are a nuisance for Elin Jones, the Assembly's chairwoman, who is expected to present the bill in the coming weeks.
The reform law will also take into account other changes to the way the Assembly operates, including rules on the dismissal of members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote on their future title during the debate on the bill.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the country's name
Next Sunday, voters will decide whether their country will soon be called the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum is expected to help end decades of dispute with neighboring Greece, which is home to a region called Macedonia.
The government in Athens has long maintained that the name of its northern neighbor constitutes a territorial claim, and has repeatedly opposed attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
Horg Ivanov, the president of Macedonia and an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the results of the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change is necessary to allow the country to join the European Union and NATO.
The bells of New York's St. Martin's Church are silent in the face of the problems plaguing churches in Harlem.
"The older people I talk to say that once upon a time, you could find a bar and a church on every corner".
There's no sign of them now.
As he says, the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
"People are now giving back in a different way", he said.
Bars have ceased to be regular meeting places for community members.
For churches, he is concerned that the proceeds from the sale of property will not last as long as the decision-makers think and that they will 'sooner or later find themselves at the starting point'.
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings inhabited by people who would not support other nearby churches.
He said, "The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white, and this will accelerate the total closure of churches because it is unlikely that new residents will become members of these parishes.
Both churches were built by a congregation of white believers before Harlem joined the metropolitan community in 1870 (St. Martin's Church joined the community a decade later).
The original white Methodist congregation left the neighborhood in the 1930's.
The local African-American congregation took over ownership of the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott against vendors on 125th Street (Harlem's main shopping street) opposed to employing or promoting African Americans.
The 1939 fire severely damaged the building, but John Howard Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild the temple and commissioned the construction of a bell tower.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of John Howard Johnson and his successor at St Martin's, was proud to call the new carillon the "Poor Bell".
An expert who rang the bells in July described it differently as: 'a cultural treasure' and 'an irreplaceable historical instrument'.
Tiffany Ng, a University of Michigan expert, also noted that it is the world's first carillon performed by a black musician, the artist being Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to Riverside Church 18 years ago, where a larger band was waiting for him.
Malcolm J. Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not replace him.
In recent months, St. Martin's has been the site of a number of complicated events involving architects and contractors, some brought to the scene by lay church leaders and some by the Episcopal Church.
In July, the parish council (a governing body of the parish made up of lay leaders) addressed their concerns to the diocese, saying that it would like to pass on the costs to the council, although the council was not involved in hiring the architects and contractors sent to the site.
Some parishioners also complain about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark injured a 13-year-old lobster diver in California
Authorities say a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old lobster diver in California on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in the American city of Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving for about a half hour with friends on Saturday morning when he heard a cry for help.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was excited about catching the lobster, but he soon realized that the child was screaming, "I've been bitten!"
I was bitten!
When Chad Hammel arrived at the scene, he noticed that the boy had completely torn skin around his collarbone.
"I started shouting to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' " Hammel added.
The boy was flown by helicopter to the Children's Hospital of the Council Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was listed in critical condition.
The shark species responsible for the attack remains unknown.
At a press conference, rescue captain Larry Giles said the fish had been spotted weeks earlier but was not considered a dangerous species.
Larry Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries to the upper torso.
For the purposes of the investigation and for security reasons, the authorities have closed the entrance to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours.
Larry Giles noted that the area is home to over 135 species of sharks, although most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to expand into the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is throwing a glove at shops like Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by introducing department stores with department store-style cosmetics and specially trained salespeople.
As part of a major investment in the UK cosmetics market  worth £2.8 billion and growing despite the decline in the fashion and household goods industry , the 11 stores will have larger cosmetics shelves.
The return to the cosmetics industry is a result of the search for ways to reuse the space previously occupied by TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's says the chain will double its cosmetics offerings to 3,000 items, including for the first time ever Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees brands will also be given more space and separate areas similar to those found in Boots stores.
In addition, the supermarket chain plans to refresh its boutique makeup line, with most items now vegan-friendly, a demand increasingly made by younger customers.
In addition, the fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will set up test points at two Sainsbury's supermarkets, the first opening last week in Croydon, south London, and the second opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
The prevalence of online sales and daily purchases of small quantities of food from local shops means that supermarkets must encourage customers to visit more.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said that outlets will increasingly resemble department stores as the chain tries to fight discounters like Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has set up Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has been introducing a number of Habitat outlets since taking over both companies two years ago, which the company says is helping to boost food sales and increase the return on investment.
The previous attempt to reorganise the cosmetics and pharmaceuticals departments failed.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's formed a joint venture with Boots as a test case, but the partnership ended following a dispute over the distribution of revenues from the pharmacies operating in the supermarkets.
Sainsbury's is implementing a new strategy following the sale of 281 pharmacies to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125 million three years ago.
Lloyds will reportedly help to deliver the plan by introducing an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to the four stores in the chain.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have redesigned the look and feel of the cosmetics department to improve the customer experience.
We've invested in special training for our employees so they can help consumers shop.
Our brands are able to meet all needs, and our friendly surroundings and convenient locations allow us to attract customers looking for cosmetics and to challenge traditional shopping habits.
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby withdrew from a £11 million contract.
Peter Jones, star of the TV show Dragons' Den, was furious to learn that Holly Willoughby was going to withdraw from the £11 million lifestyle brand to focus on a new partnership with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Holly Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of home accessories and household goods called Truly.
The business has been compared on several occasions to the Goop brand owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning, the 37-year-old news anchor announced her departure via Instagram.
Holly Willoughby's sudden decision to leave a thriving lifestyle brand and focus on a newly formed partnership with Marks & Spencer and ITV has angered Peter Jones, star of Dragons' Den.
Sources say Peter Jones was furious when the popular TV presenter announced during a nervous meeting at his business empire's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday that new contracts worth up to £1.5m would mean he would not have time to devote to their Trula brand of home accessories and household goods.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand, and was also expected to double Holly Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune.
After announcing his decision to leave the Trula brand via Instagram by 37-year-old Holly Willoughby, Peter Jones left the UK to head to one of his summer homes.
According to a source, Mark Truly was a priority for Holly Willoughby.
She wanted to be involved in her future and to be involved in her life for the next few decades.
The decision to withdraw from the operation completely surprised everyone involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to the market.
There's a warehouse in Marlow with a lot of merchandise ready to go.
Experts believe that the resignation of the This Morning presenter and one of Britain's most successful stars could cost the company millions of pounds due to significant investment in products  ranging from pillows to candles to clothing and household goods  and further delay entry.
It could also mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
Holly Willoughby (mother of three) and her husband Dan Baldwin had a close relationship with Peter Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Holly Willoughby and Tara Capp co-founded Truly in 2016, and Peter Jones, 52, joined them in March as CEO.
The couples were vacationing together, and Jones owned 40% of a television production company owned by Dan Baldwin.
Holly Willoughby is set to become M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Peter Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his business dealings".
It was a tough conversation, and then we fell in love.
The president joked about the media criticism of his remarks, which some saw as "unfitting for a husband of the state", as well as his positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a mocking voice, pretending to be a TV host:
I've given up nothing.
The president noted that Kim Jong Un is interested in a second meeting, the first of which took place in Singapore in June and was hailed by Trump as a major step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on nuclear disarmament are being delayed.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that he saw no similar response from the United States to North Korea's early efforts to disarm.
He noted that instead the United States maintains sanctions and pressure.
President Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea", he said.
We were planning a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
We have a great relationship now.
The president said his efforts to improve relations with Kim Jong Un had produced positive results: they led to the end of missile tests, helped free hostages and brought the remaining American troops home.
He has also defended his unusual approach when discussing his relationship with Kim Jong Un.
"It's easy to be a president, but instead of 10,000 people waiting outside trying to get into a crowded stadium, we'd have 200 people here", Trump said, pointing at the crowd gathered directly in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake devastate one island in Indonesia, killing hundreds
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the loss of more than 10 percent of Lombok's population, the authorities have not declared a natural disaster, a prerequisite for speeding up international relief efforts.
Unfortunately, in many cases the authorities have made it very clear that they are not seeking international support.
While Save the Children is preparing to travel to the Indonesian city of Palu, it is not yet clear if international personnel will be able to respond.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international aid should be allowed in.
With Indonesia continually being shaken, the country remains completely unprepared to deal with the forces of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh province, they are rare for the rest of the coastline.
The lack of a tsunami warning in Palu  despite the tsunami warning  probably contributed to the death toll.
Even in the most favorable conditions, traveling between the Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship, which is based on the island of Lombok, is on its way to Palu to help earthquake victims, but it will take at least three days to reach its destination.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia's infrastructure a major focus of his campaign and has allocated a lot of money to roads and railways.
However, in the run-up to next year's election, the administration is struggling with a lack of resources.
Joko Widodo has also come under pressure due to the country's ongoing religious tensions, with members of the Muslim majority adopting a more conservative form of faith.
Over a thousand people have been killed and tens of thousands of residents have been left homeless as Christian and Muslim gangs fight with machetes, bows, arrows and other simple weapons in the streets.
See: Liverpool footballer Daniel Sturridge scores a goal in a draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat by Chelsea in the English Premier League by scoring an 89th-minute goal in Saturday's game at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 yards from Chelsea's goal in a 1-0 loss to his team.
He put the ball in his left foot before he shot it into the away goal.
The ball was floating high above the penalty area towards the top right corner of the net.
Then she fell into the goal, flying over the arribalagas throwing themselves at her.
"I was just trying to get in position and catch the ball, knowing that players like Shaqiri always try to get it as far forward as possible, and I wanted to give myself the best shot", Sturridge told Liverpool FC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching, I took the ball and I shot it back without thinking".
Chelsea led 1-0 at half-time after a goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward kicked a ball with his heel to Mateo Kovacic, then ran towards Liverpool's half.
Kovacic was quick to take the pass in the middle of the field.
Then he made a beautiful play forwards into the penalty area back to Hazard.
Hazard passed the defenders and returned a left foot shot towards the long post that missed Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
The Indonesian Disaster Management Agency reported Sunday morning that the death toll from the recent earthquake and tsunami in the country had risen to 832.
At a news conference, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said that the 7.5-magnitude quake on Friday left many people trapped under rubble and triggered a 20-foot tsunami.
Palu, a city of over 380,000, is full of ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing a woman.
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds in Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking for contact from anyone in the area who has seen or heard of any suspicious activity.
Brian O'Hagan, Commissioner of the Investigation Division, said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to appeal to anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead at the time who saw or heard anything suspicious.
I also appeal to all drivers, and particularly to taxi drivers, whose registrars have been able to capture material useful in the investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman was a resident of Birkenhead and that her body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, people claiming to know the woman arrived at the scene to find out where she was found.
Police say they're in the process of informing the victim's family of the incident.
A taxi driver from Grayson Mews recently tried to enter an apartment building, but was informed by police that entry and exit is currently prohibited.
He went silent when he found out what happened.
Residents have just been informed that they will not be able to return to their homes for some time.
One of the officers was heard explaining to the man that the area was now considered a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene crying.
She kept saying, "It's so horrible".
At 2:00 p.m., two police cars were in the fenced area, and another police vehicle was parked right next to it.
There are officers inside the restricted area guarding the apartment building.
Anyone with information is asked to contact Twitter (@MerPolCC) or phone 101 or anonymously report the incident to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, giving the number 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's monument in front of the British Parliament, the latest casualty in a dispute over "Rewrite History".
Removing the monument would bring justice to the reminiscent Taliban destruction of many British cultural and religious sites by its radical, puritanical followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Jeremy Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In view of the ongoing debate over the removal of monuments, the dispute over the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster was a matter of time.
The artistic activities during the English Civil Wars were neither commissioned nor performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the actions of his ancestor Thomas were a century earlier a punishment for the wrong Cromwell.
The way Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft portrayed Cromwell on the monument reflects the reputation of the 19th-century politician and the fact that many still consider him a figure worth remembering.
John Goldsmith said in an interview with The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was seen by many people perhaps more often in the 19th century than now as the defender of Parliament from outside pressures.
The validity of this statement is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the course of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure on one side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.
In China, a farmer was fatally bitten by a pig.
According to local media, a farmer was fatally attacked by a pig at a market in southwest China.
On Sunday, the South China Morning Post reported that a man named Yuan was found dead, bleeding and with a severed artery, near a barn in a marketplace in Liupanshui, Kuejchow province.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs in a pigsty in Xining, Qinghai, China, May 30, 2005.
According to reports, the man came to the market with his cousin from the neighboring province of Junnan to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, his cousin found the man's body and noticed the door to the nearby barn open.
He said there was a big pig in the pigsty with blood on its cheek.
The autopsy confirmed that the nearly 250-pound pig was the one who killed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and bruised", said a man named Wu, quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance footage shows Yuan arriving at the market at 4:40 on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The manager of the market told the Guiyang Evening News that the police were isolating the people while they were collecting evidence to prevent another attack.
According to reports, the man's family and the marketplace authorities are negotiating compensation for the death.
There have been reports of pig attacks on humans before, although these are rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, leaving a man with fatal injuries.
Ten years earlier, in Wales, a 300-pound pig had nailed a farmer to a tractor, and the man's wife had pulled the animal away.
After a pig ate an Oregon farmer in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that the animals are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can trigger violent behavior.
They just want to play.
They're as inquisitive as children... they don't want to hurt anyone.
"You just have to show them the proper respect", he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remnants will cause heavy rainfall in the southwestern United States.
Forecasts indicate that Hurricane Rosa is losing momentum as it moves over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, it will cause heavy rainfall in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa is a Category 1 hurricane with winds of nearly 85 miles per hour, and was located 400 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, at 5:00 a.m. eastern time on Sunday.
The weather forecast for Sunday is Rosa will move north.
Meanwhile, it is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean as it heads eastward toward the west coast of the United States, and on Monday, Rosa will approach the California Peninsula as a tropical storm, moving moist air masses northward into the southwestern United States.
Monday, it will bring up to 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico.
In the coming days, humid tropical air and incoming downpours will bring torrential rain to the southwest.
In some places, rainfall of between 2.5 and 10 cm will lead to flash floods, displacement of pollutants and possible landslides in desert areas.
The humid tropical air will cause anywhere from two to three inches of rain per hour, especially in parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Even two to three inches of rain is forecast in some parts of the Southwest, especially over much of Arizona.
The scattered nature of tropical rainfall makes sudden floods and rapid changes in conditions possible.
When faced with the threat of tropical rain, walking in the desert is strongly discouraged.
Heavy rainfall can turn canyons into raging rivers, and thunderstorms can cause local gusty winds and dust to move.
The coming thunderstorm will bring heavy local rainfall to the Southern California coast.
Rainfall of more than 1.3 cm total is possible, which may cause minor pollution movements and road hazards.
This would be the first rainfall of this rainy season in the region.
The tropical storm will begin moving into Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, with more rainfall expected in most areas on Monday afternoon and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will hit the Four Corners region of the western United States on Tuesday and continue through Wednesday.
In October, as the Arctic region cools, temperatures throughout the United States may fluctuate, but the intertidal zone is likely to be warm.
This can lead to rapid temperature changes over short distances.
A good example is the temperature difference on Sunday in the central United States.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis, Missouri, and Des Moines, Iowa, the differences are nearly 10 degrees Fahrenheit [10°C].
The temperatures that have been maintained in the summer may rise again in the coming days.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience warm early October, with temperatures ranging from about 85 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit [26 to 32°C] in the area from the southern Great Plains to the Northeast.
Tuesday in New York City, temperatures may reach 90 degrees Fahrenheit [27°C], or about five degrees above average.
Long-term weather forecasts indicate a high probability of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh hearing.
More than 20 million people watched on six television stations Thursday's moving hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christina Blasey Ford, the woman who accused the lawyer of sexual harassment in the 1980s.
Despite the ongoing political deadlock on Friday, commentators had to interrupt regular programming to report a sudden turnaround: a deal proposed by Senator Jeff Flake that would see the FBI conduct a weekly investigation into the allegations.
Christine Blasey Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% certain that Kavanaugh groped her while she was sober and tried to strip her during a high school party.
In his emotional testimony, Kavanaugh said he was convinced that this was not the case.
It is possible that Friday's television audience was even higher than Nielsen's 20.4 million.
The company calculated the average television viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
However, figures for other stations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen generally has difficulty measuring viewership among people in the workplace.
This is similar to the viewership of the World Cup or the Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, the Fox News Channel, whose presenters strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, had the highest ratings, averaging 5.69 million viewers during the day's audition.
In second place was ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million.
Interest in the subject remained high after the hearing.
Jeff Flake has become a key figure in Friday's events.
He was caught on CNN and CBS cameras in the early hours of the morning after the moderate Republican's office released a statement saying he had decided to support Kavanaugh's nomination, shouting at protesters who had blocked him from entering the elevator on his way to a judicial committee hearing.
Flake listened with his head down for a few minutes to the negative reviews, and the whole thing was broadcast on CNN.
I'm standing here before you and I'm asking.
Do you think he's telling the nation the truth?
You have strength in the face of the powerlessness so many women have heard from a demonstrating woman.
Before the elevator door closed, Jeff Flake said his office had issued a statement and that he would testify at the committee hearing.
Later, television stations continued to broadcast the events pending a vote on Kavanaugh's nomination before the full Senate.
Flake said he would only support the nomination if he knew the FBI would investigate the charges next week, as the Democratic minority has insisted.
Flake was persuaded after a conversation with his friend, Senator Chris Coons of the Democratic Party.
Flake made his decision after meeting with Chris Coons and a few other senators.
Flake's election was important because the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Brett Kavanaugh's nomination without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations made against Brett Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of using Brexit to their advantage
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of playing with Britain's future and undermining the national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with Theresa May on the front page, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson attacked a plan for future relations with the European Union after Brexit that would see Britain and the EU levy tariffs on its behalf, calling it "totally ridiculous".
Police arrest Dyton Simpson on suspicion of the murder of an LSU football player .
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old Louisiana State University basketball player.
According to reports from the Baton Rouge Police Department, 20-year-old Dyton Simpson has been arrested and taken into custody on charges of second-degree murder.
Authorities released a video of a confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
According to CBS affiliate WAFB, officers found the glasses at the scene and found traces of Simpson's DNA on them.
Police said after questioning Simpson, he admitted to shooting Wayde.
According to the detainee's lawyer, bail has been set at $350,000.
On Friday, the East Baton Rouge coroner's office released a preliminary report that stated the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The police department is thanking the Louisiana State Police Search Team, the state police forensic laboratory, Southern University Police and the surrounding community for their assistance in the investigation leading to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU athletic director, thanked local law enforcement for their "effort and commitment to justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot-two man grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne Sims, also played basketball at LSU.
In his final season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shaken and devastated" by Wayde's death.
"It's one of those things we're always afraid of", said Will Wade.
Ash from the volcano reaches Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatépetl volcano has reached the southern districts of Mexico City.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano because of increased activity in the crater and 183 cases of gas and ash emissions in the past 24 hours.
The center reported numerous buzzing and convulsions.
Photos posted on social media show car windows covered in a thin layer of ash in neighborhoods like Xochimilco in Mexico.
Since the magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists have been reporting an increase in activity at a volcano located 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police on the eve of a violent demonstration to mark the first anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum.
A group of masked separatists threw eggs and powder paint at police officers, and dark clouds of dust covered the streets, usually crowded with tourists.
Clashes continued later in the day, with police using batons to stop the fighting.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted "We will not forget, we will not forgive", while anti-secessionists chanted "Long live Spain".
According to local media, 14 people have received medical treatment for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
A year after the referendum on October 1, tensions are high, and although the Madrid authorities declared it illegal, it is still a cause for celebration for Catalans who want secession.
Voters overwhelmingly supported independence, but turnout was low due to a widespread boycott by opponents.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly a thousand people were injured last year in violent clashes with police trying to prevent voting at polling stations.
On Friday evening, pro-independence groups in the region decided to prevent a demonstration in support of the police.
The demonstration went ahead despite this, but was forced to change course.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who is taking part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of Catalonia's independence.
Last year was one of the most beautiful times of our lives.
My parents were crying for the chance to vote, but now we're stuck in a dead end", he said.
Despite a significant, if small, victory in the local elections last December, pro-secession parties in Catalonia are struggling to continue their activities, with many of the most recognized leaders either having decided to leave or awaiting trial in custody over their role in the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded a protest in support of the police by phone, said that politicians on both sides of the dispute were fueling the conflict.
"The situation is getting more tense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders held in custody since the end of last year, announced his intention to run in next year's European Parliament elections.
Candidating for the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the crisis of democratic values in the Spanish government  he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after driving into a house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested following a multiple car crash in a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 British time (BST).
Detective Commissioner Bob Blemmings said the damage to the gate and the building.
At some point, a shot from a shotgun could have been fired at the car.
Mengi's goal ensures Livingston wins the game 1-0 against the Rangers.
Dolly Mengi 's first goal for Livingston brought the team victory .
Livingston, who have been in the top flight since the start of the season, have stunned Rangers, with Steven Gerrard suffering just his second defeat in his 18 games as manager of Ibrox Park.
Dolly Mengi's goal proved to be the winner, and Gary Holt's team moved into second place in the standings, tied with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team are unbeaten in the Premiership this season and next Sunday they face Hearts, who are eight points behind.
Sooner, because on Thursday, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the UEFA Europa League.
Livingston extends its division win streak to six games, and Coach Holt hasn't missed a game since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed a few chances against unresponsive opponents.
Holt's team should have taken the lead much sooner, because the team's play had caused the Rangers a lot of problems.
First, Scott Robinson broke through the defense and hit the back of the net, but failed to score, then Alan Lithgow missed after taking Craig Halkett's head.
The hosts allowed the Rangers to play closer to the goal, knowing they could threaten the opponents during steady portions of the game.
And that's how the decisive goal was scored.
After the Rangers gave up a free throw, Livingston's team saw an opportunity, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create a situation for Mende, who scored from the middle of the penalty area.
The Rangers had more possession at this point, but they were unable to overtake the home defense and did not cause much trouble for goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
The same pattern was repeated in the second half when Alfredo Morelos hit a one-run home run to Kelly.
Scott Pittman's shot was defended by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and Lithgow failed to hit the light of the goal from another fixed fragment in favour of Livingston.
The Rangers continued to attack from the Livingston penalty area, but could not take advantage of the situation, demanding two penalties after Halkett's intervention against substitute Glenn Middleton and one hand play.
Livingston's performance was phenomenal.
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Almondvale Park
Great performance and score for Livingston.
He said they played great, once again exceeding expectations.
Their style and lineup have changed little since returning to the top flight, but Holt is to be commended for motivating the team to play.
This game had a lot of heroes.
Captain Craig Halkett played a huge role in guiding a well-organized defense, while Menga made it very difficult for Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall to stay focused throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked the will to fight.
Although they've had some great moments under Gerrard, they've failed to live up to their standards in this game.
But something was missing in their game, and it was only once they got through the home defense, which should be a serious warning to the Rangers, who were in the middle of the table.
Mixed Reactions to Erdogan's Cologne Visit
The leaders of Turkey and Germany were greeted with smiles and beautiful weather at a breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (September 29).
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at improving relations between the NATO allies.
The dispute has been caused by differences over human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
After the meeting, Erdogan went to Cologne, where he opened a new, huge mosque.
It is the largest population of Turks outside their homeland.
Police said they had blocked the 25,000-strong crowd outside the temple for security reasons, but supporters of the president had gathered in the area to see their leader.
Hundreds of Erdogan's opponents  including many Kurds  also decided to speak out, condemning the Turkish leader's policies and the German government's decision to adopt a politician in the country.
The mixed protests reflect the divisions caused by the visit of a politician hailed as a hero by some Turks living in Germany and an autocrat by others.
Motorcyclist killed in crash in Deptford
A cyclist was killed after colliding with a car in London.
The accident happened near the busy intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street in Deptford, a southeastern borough of the city, at around 10:15am (BST).
The driver stopped the vehicle and the paramedics arrived, but despite their intervention, the man died at the scene.
A few months ago, another fatal accident involving a cyclist occurred on Childers Street (about a mile from the scene of Saturday's accident) and the offender fled the scene.
Metropolitan Police said officers are working to identify the dead man and notify family members of the incident.
Roads were closed and buses were diverted, and drivers were told to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Correctional Facility: Six officers injured in riot
According to the prison authorities, six officers were injured in a riot at a high security men's prison.
The riots at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire began around 9:30am (BST) on Sunday and are still ongoing.
A special Tornado unit was called to the riot involving eight prisoners in one of the wings of the facility.
Officers at the scene suffered minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the facility said: The operation at HMP Long Lartin Prison involved specially trained personnel.
Six officers sustained minor injuries.
We have no tolerance for violence in our facilities, and we are confident that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend more time in prison.
HMP Long Lartin is home to over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, reports surfaced that the plant's manager had to go to the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, the plant was called to the scene of a violent riot in which workers were attacked with billiard balls.
Flash flooding from Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (possible positive effects on drought areas)
It's rare for a tropical depression to make it to Arizona, and it's likely to do so early next week as the remnants of Hurricane Rosa move through the desert areas of the Southwest, posing a threat of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a flash flood warning for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The weather forecast says Rosa will pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and rain will begin Monday afternoon.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported on Twitter that since 1950, only 10 tropical cyclones have maintained storm or tropical depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) came within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest National Hurricane Center forecasts rainfall of 5 to 10 centimeters, and in some areas of the Mogollon Rim in Arizona, it could reach as high as 15 centimeters.
In the remaining desert areas of the Southwest  including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin  rainfall is expected to be between 2.5 and 5 cm, and in some areas up to 10 cm.
For those outside the areas at risk of flash flooding, the rainfall from Hurricane Rosa can bring relief, since the region has been suffering from a long-standing drought.
Although flooding poses a serious threat, some of the rainfall will improve the situation in the Southwest, where drought conditions are severe.
According to weather.com, the U.S. Drought Monitor estimates that nearly 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing severe drought, the second-highest category.
Hurricane Rosa will make landfall first on the California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa continued to move at hurricane strength on Sunday morning, reaching speeds of up to 85 miles per hour (137 km/h). It is currently located 400 miles (620 km) south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at 12 miles per hour (19 km/h).
The hurricane is hitting cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, causing it to weaken.
Forecasts say it'll hit Mexico as a tropical storm Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rains in parts of Mexico can pose a serious risk of flooding.
Weather.com reported that an area from the California Peninsula to northwestern Sonora is forecast to receive 7 to 15 centimeters of rain, though up to 25 centimeters are possible.
Then, Rosa will move northward through Mexico as a tropical storm, reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and moving into southern Utah by Tuesday evening.
The most serious threat from Hurricane Rosa or its remnants is heavy rainfall in the California Peninsula, northwestern Sonora, and desert areas of the southwestern United States, says the National Hurricane Center.
Forecasts say that the rains will cause life-threatening flash floods and pollution displacement in the desert and mudslides in the mountains.
Midsomer Norton attack: four people arrested in connection with attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of the attempted murder of a 16-year-old found with stab wounds in Somerset County.
The boy was found on Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at around 4:00am BST.
The victim was taken to a hospital and remains in stable condition.
Avon and Somerset Police say a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area last night.
Officers are asking for contact with anyone with footage of the incident.
Trump said that Brett Kavanaugh "has experienced the meanness and anger of the Democratic Party".
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and outrageous behavior of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "has experienced the meanness and anger of the Democratic Party during the nomination process".
On Thursday, Brett Kavanaugh testified before Congress, strongly and emotionally denying the allegations of Christina Blasey Ford, who claims that she was sexually assaulted by a man decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified at her arraignment on her allegations.
On Saturday, the president said it was a day for the American people to see the brilliance, class and courage of Kavanaugh.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in support of one of the most distinguished lawyers of our time, a legal scholar with a great deal of community service", he told a crowd of supporters at a rally in West Virginia.
The president made a vague reference to the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, discussing the importance of Republican turnout in a midterm election.
We're five weeks away from the most important decision of our lives.
I'm not running for office, but I'm very active", he said.
I'm still fighting to defend our great candidates.
Trump claims the Democrats are pursuing a policy of "resistance and obstruction".
According to CNN, an aide to a top Republican politician, the first key Senate vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected by Friday at the latest.
Hundreds of people killed in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami.
Authorities said on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed  many of them washed up on beaches  by high waves after a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered on the beach in Palu to participate in a festival in the city, and at dusk waves as high as 20 feet [6 m] hit the shore, carrying many people and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was the result of a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
When the threat emerged yesterday, people on the beach did not flee immediately and were killed by the tsunami  said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's BNPD disaster agency, at a conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami hit everything in its path, taking cars, logs and houses", Nugroho said, adding that the element was moving at sea at 500 miles per hour before reaching the coastline.
He said that some people climbed trees to escape and survived.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photos released by the disaster agency show many destroyed homes and shops, damaged and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was hit by aftershocks.
A series of earthquakes hit the area of 2.4 million people.
According to a statement by Indonesia's Bureau of Technology Assessment and Use (BPPT), the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times greater than the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The statement said that the city's location at the end of a long, narrow bay could have intensified the tsunami's effects.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He added that some bodies were found under collapsed buildings, 540 people were injured and 29 people were still missing.
Nugroho said that the death toll and damage may be higher along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which was closer to the epicenter.
According to Nugroho, communication "has been completely paralyzed", so there are no reports from Donggala province.
There are over 300,000 people living there  The Red Cross said in a statement that its staff and volunteers were reaching out to the affected areas.
"We can speak of tragedy now, although the situation could deteriorate significantly", the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency faced widespread criticism for its lack of information about the tsunami that hit Palu, but authorities said the waves came just after the tsunami warning was issued.
Amateur video shared on social media shows a man screaming from a building, trying to warn people on the street of the coming tsunami.
Within minutes, the wall of water broke against the shore, washing away buildings and cars.
Reuters was not immediately able to confirm the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused significant power outages, cutting off communications within the city of Palu, and making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending transport planes from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated people are still in dire need of food and other basic necessities, officials said.
The airport in the city is open only for humanitarian aid and will remain closed until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu.
More than 800 people have died in the tsunami in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
Doseba T. Sinay, World Vision's country director, said World Vision staff arrived safely from Donggala province to Palu and found shelter in tarp tents in the office yard.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses", he said.
The situation is very bad.
While some groups are slow to start bringing aid, there have been criticisms that experienced foreign aid workers are being prevented from traveling to Palus.
Under Indonesian law, foreign funding, resources and personnel can only be accepted after a disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
So far, no such thing has been done.
"We are still officially dealing with a regional disaster", said a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government decides that a national disaster has occurred, we can begin to receive international aid.
Two days after the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Palu on Friday, friends and families of the missing continue to hope that their loved ones will be miraculously found among the destruction.
A little boy was pulled from the sewers on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who had spent two days under the rubble next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national parachuting team, has been training two missing parachutists competing in the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia.
According to Petra Mandagi, the other people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
"As an experienced parachutist, I'm struggling with my own emotional weight", he said.
Gendon Subandono told how within hours of news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse reaching the parachute community, he was desperately sending WhatsApp messages to athletes attending the beach festival.
His messages were marked with only one grey hook instead of a pair of blue hooks.
"I think it means that the messages have not been delivered", he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 while refilling cash at an ATM at the Newport on the Levee shopping mall.
According to a statement from the Newport Police Department, on Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was cashing in at an ATM at the Newport on the Levee shopping center.
"The driver of the car was emptying an ATM at the amusement park and preparing to replenish the cash", Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
Another man ran from behind a Brink's employee and stole a bag of cash from an ATM.
According to a statement, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not say how many people were involved.
Anyone with information about the identity of the robber is asked to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West has decided to change his name to Ye.
Announcing his intention on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote about himself: "Person formerly known as Kanye West".
The 41-year-old has been using the alias Ye for some time, which is also the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes ahead of a Saturday Night Live appearance, where the artist is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He will replace singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the producers, has withdrawn from the show "for emotional reasons".
West has previously stated that the word Ye is not only an abbreviation for his current stage name, but has religious meaning.
"I think that ye is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means You", West said earlier this year, discussing the album title with a radio host called Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, it's about us.
First I was Kanye, which means one person, now I'm Ye, a reflection of all our good, bad and confused qualities.
The album is about who we are.
West has joined a group of other famous rappers who have decided to change their name.
Sean Combs, known by the aliases Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, announced this year that he wanted to be called Love and Brother Love.
Jay-Z, West's former associate, also wrote his alias in different ways, with or without a hyphen and in capital letters.
President-elect of Mexico Andrés Manuel López Obrador vows not to use military force against civilians
On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the bloody suppression of a student demonstration, Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) vowed never to use the military against civilians.
On Saturday, in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas, López Obrador vowed "never to use the military to repress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing up to 300 people, at a time when leftist student movements were beginning to grow throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly financial aid for students and by creating more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are pushing young people into criminal groups.
The United States should double its funding for AI research.
Kai-Fu Lee, an AI investor and expert at Google, Microsoft and Apple, says that as China's activity in this area increases, the United States should double its spending on AI research.
The comment relates to ads about artificial intelligence published by various US government agencies, despite the US having no official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year, China unveiled its plan to become the most innovative country in artificial intelligence by 2030.
"We need to start by doubling the budget for AI research: all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are trying to make another breakthrough in this field", said Kai-Fu Lee.
In an interview with CNBC this week, he also said that doubling the funding could double the chances of another breakthrough in artificial intelligence in the United States.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, Kai-Fu Lee worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that beat the then-leading American Othello player, then took a management position at Microsoft Research and was president of Google's China division.
Lee acknowledged the success of the US government's earlier technology initiatives, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) competition for the most interesting robot designs, and asked about the timing of the next edition of the competition, as he believed it would help find future visionaries.
As Kai-Fu Lee said, scientists in the United States often have to work hard to get government funding.
"It's not China that is taking away our best academics, it's corporations", Lee said.
For the past few years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been hiring top scientists to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the United States develop AI.
"I think that people in artificial intelligence who have a PhD should be given a green card automatically", he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China published a plan to create next-generation artificial intelligence.
Lee noted that the National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding for academic institutions in a similar way to the US National Science Foundation and other government organizations that provide funding to US scientists, but the quality of academic activity in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to engage with industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA also announced that it's going to spend $2 billion on an initiative called AI Next.
The National Science Foundation is currently investing over $100 billion a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the US initiative to create a national AI safety commission has not moved forward for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the name of their country
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would help end a decades-old dispute with Greece, which has blocked the country's bids to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is home to the historic country of Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbour's name is a claim to its territory and has therefore vetoed its accession to the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of the two countries reached an agreement on the name, but nationalists say the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President George Ivanov has said he will not take part in the vote, and a campaign calling for a boycott has raised doubts about whether turnout will reach the minimum 50% required to make the referendum binding.
The referendum asked the question: "Do you support joining NATO and the EU following the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is worth paying the price for Macedonia's accession to organizations such as the European Union and NATO.
I voted for the future of my country so that young Macedonians can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union.  Membership of the EU will make us all safer  said Oliwera Georgijevska, 79, from Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of MPs have declared that they will respect the results of the vote.
A change of name requires the support of two-thirds of the members of parliament.
The state election commission said that no unusual events had been reported as of 1 p.m.
However, turnout at this hour was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary election in 2016.
"I voted for my children, our place is in Europe", said 62-year-old Kosze Tanewski, a voter from Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, in Strumica, Macedonia, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duszko voted in a referendum to change the country's name to pave the way for membership in NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage and set up chairs in front of tents set up by the referendum boycott.
We support membership in NATO and the EU, but we want to join these organisations with our heads held high, not through the back door  said Kawardarkov.
We're a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries like China or Russia and become part of Eurasian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20%.
"I believe that the vast majority will vote for the name change in the referendum because 80% of the citizens support the European Union and NATO", Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said that the 'yes' vote was 'a confirmation of our future'.
In a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Public Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters said they wanted to participate in the referendum, which is less than the required turnout.
According to another poll conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV, 57% of respondents plan to vote in the referendum on Sunday.
70% of those polled said they would support the name change.
For the vote to be successful, the turnout must be 50% + 1 vote.
A defeat in the referendum would be the first major blow to the pro-Western government's policies since it came to power in May last year.
Sergio Aguero of Manchester City beats all of Brighton's defence and scores a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling sent home Brighton's defence in a 2-0 home win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Agura's goal in the 65th minute looked childishly easy.
The action started with a pass in the middle of the field to the Argentine striker.
The footballer has overtaken three of Brighton's defenders.
Aguero was then included in the four Brighton players.
First he beat one of them, then he beat the others and found himself on the edge of Brighton's penalty area.
He then played the ball to the left where Sterling was waiting for her.
The English striker immediately passed the ball back to Aguera in the penalty area, who defeated Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a shot to the right of the goal.
Aguero is battling a foot injury, Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We were talking about the possibility of playing 55, 60 minutes.
And that's exactly what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal in that time.
However, it was Sterling who secured the Blues their first ever Premier League lead in singles.
The goal in question fell in the 29th minute.
In this action, Aguero gets the ball deep into Brighton's half.
He threw a great pass down the left side of the court to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few moves, allowing Sterling to move to the far pole.
Manchester City striker hit the net just before it hit the car.
Manchester City will play Hoffenheim in the UEFA Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to ruin the Rockies' chances of winning.
After losing his playoff spot to the Washington Nationals, Scherzer was not called up to the first team.
However, the rivalry-loving Scherzer is hoping to play in Sunday's game against the Colorado Rockies if the Rockies can still make the playoffs, currently one win ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies can at least count on a wild card if they win Friday's game against the Nationals 5-2, but they're still looking to win their first division title.
Even though we're playing for nothing, at least we'll be able to get on the field knowing that the atmosphere in Denver and the performance of the opponents will be at the highest level, just like the rest of the season.
Why wouldn't I want to be part of this meeting?
The Nationals have not yet named a starting pitcher for Sunday's game, but the team is leaning toward putting Scherzer on the starting lineup.
This would be Scherzer's 34th first-team appearance, and he's attending Thursday's pitching practice and hopes to make his debut on Sunday.
The right-handed pitcher from Washington is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA, 300 strikeouts and 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump rally in West Virginia
Trump has not directly addressed his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, discussing the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
In November, we will be putting all our achievements on the table.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important decisions of our lives.
"I'm not running, but I'm very active, and I'm always defending our great candidates", he said.
He went on to say, "We're dealing with a terrible group of radical Democrats.
They are determined to seize power by any means necessary.
They don't care who they hurt or who they have to hurt to gain power and control, because power and control is their goal, and we're not going to give it to them.
He said the Democrats are on a mission to "resist and hinder".
"It's been very clear over the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "evil, malicious, nasty and untrue".
The president addressed the Senate Judiciary Committee by name, referring to Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, to a rousing cheer from the crowd.
Do you remember her answer?
Are you responsible for the leak?
Uh, what's up?
No, I mean, no, her body language was terrible, and it was the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer a group of people with different views.
The party is intolerant of people expressing their opinions
When the Momentum activists in my party voted to give me a reprimand, I wasn't surprised.
After all, I'm a member of a group of Labour MPs who were recently told they were not welcome, all because of their own opinions.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she spoke out against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the request for a reprimand was the result of a disagreement between me and Jeremy Corbyn.
The differences were about the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe, and ironically, Jeremy Corbyn was opposed to the positions of previous leaders on these issues.
The announcement on Friday for the meeting of Labour MPs for Nottingham East read: 'We want the meetings to be open and productive'.
In my eight years as a Labour Party MP, most of the Friday afternoon General Committee meetings have looked like this.
Unfortunately, many meetings are now different, and the promise of a "warmer and milder" policy, if ever remembered, has long since been forgotten.
It is becoming increasingly clear that the Labour Party does not tolerate any difference of opinion, and that every opinion is judged on its conformity to the leadership of the party.
It all started soon after Jeremy Corbyn took office, when colleagues, who I thought had similar views, began to expect me to change course and take positions that I had not previously agreed to, on issues such as national security or the EU single market.
After every public speech  regardless of the content  I encounter on social media attacks calling for me to withdraw my nomination, condemn centrism or leave the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I'm luckier than some of my colleagues because the remarks being made to me are more political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who experience sexist or racist treatment every day, but do not shy away from action.
One of the most disappointing aspects of current politics is the way people are becoming so used to insulting others.
Last week Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer a group of people with different views, and with every vote of no confidence and every change in the rules of the election, the party's worldview is narrowed.
Over the last two years, I've been told many times not to stand up and keep things quiet, and then everything would be fine.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student as a result of the neglect of Margaret Thatcher's government that led to the break-up of my school classroom, I have been working to improve the quality of public services for people in need  both as a local councillor and as a minister.
I never hid my beliefs, not even during the last election campaign.
Everyone in Nottingham East knew my position and knew of my differences with the party leadership.
To those who supported Friday's motion, I cannot understand the willingness to waste time and energy on the question of my loyalty to the Labour leader in the face of an impending Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and public services.
But the most important message I have to give is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents (both Labour and others): I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or any temporary political objectives will deter me from acting in accordance with my convictions and in the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr versus Melrose 38:17  undefeated Ayr on top again
Two late goals could have somehow skewed the final score, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this extremely interesting Scottish Premiership game.
The team has moved to the top of the table and remains the only undefeated team.
In the end, it was this outstanding defense and better use of chances that led the home team to victory.
"The matches so far have been challenging for us, but we are still unbeaten, so I am satisfied", he said.
Robyn Christie of the Melrose team said: "We have to give Ayr a little credit, they took advantage of the opportunities that came our way".
Ayr took the lead in the 14th minute after a goal from Grant Anderson and a lift from Frazier Clim, however a yellow card for Scottishman Rory Hughes, who had come on from the Glasgow Warriors, allowed Melrose to tie the score when Jason Baggot caught the ball after an unused chance for a lift.
Climo extended Ayr's lead after kicking a penalty kick just before the end of the first half, scoring first and then taking the chance to raise the lead to 17-5 for Ayr.
Melrose got off to a good start in the second half, and a touchdown from Patrick Anderson, lifted by Baggot, cut the deficit to five points.
The game was then suspended for a long time due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried off the field on a stretcher.
In the next round, the team's captain, Ayr Blair Macpherson, received a yellow card, and Melrose again used his numbers: a pass with an unused attempt to raise Bruce Colvin reduced the lead.
The hosts took the lead when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for striking out Clima without a ball and MacPherson scored on the back of an approaching defense.
Climo took the opportunity to raise the score, but he did it again just after the game resumed when Kyle Rowe caught a penalty kick and allowed winger Gregor Henry to score his fifth home run.
The star of the show " Still Game " is starting a career in the catering industry .
Ford Kieran, star of the hit TV show Still Game, seems to be getting into the restaurant business.
The 56-year-old actor is playing Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC sitcom, starring and co-creating the series with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the show's last, and all indications are that Ford Kiernan is already planning for the future after leaving Craiglang.
According to official records, he became a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, although a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan was trying to get involved in the burgeoning Glasgow catering industry.
The sea is ours: Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
The Marines are patrolling the area around the naval base in La Paz.
Blue flags flying from public buildings.
The following motto is displayed in the naval ports from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon: "The sea is ours by law.
It's our duty to get him back.
In landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the bloody 19th century resource conflict is still alive, just like the dream of sailing the Pacific Ocean again.
The hopes are perhaps the highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice, due on October 1 after a five-year trial.
"Bolivia's efforts are gaining momentum, and the people are unanimous, optimistic and hopeful for a favorable verdict", said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians across the country will be watching the International Court of Justice in the hope that the Hague-based organization will recognize Bolivia's claim and after decades of fruitless talks, Chile will have to negotiate for the country to have independent access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic president who will face a controversial re-election bid next year, also has high hopes for Monday's ruling.
We're very close to returning to the Pacific, he vowed at the end of August.
Some analysts, however, say that the chances of a favorable ruling are slim and that even a favorable ruling would make little difference.
The United Nations body in The Hague has no authority to grant Bolivia territory in Chile and has also said it will not interfere with any talks.
Paz Zárate, a Chilean international law expert, said the International Court of Justice's decision would be issued six months after the final arguments were presented.
Unfortunately for Bolivia, the last four years could have pushed the country away from its goal.
The issue of access to the sea has been appropriated by the current Bolivian administration  said Paz Zárate.
Morales's unyielding rhetoric has robbed Chileans of any vestiges of goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but it will be very difficult given the current situation.
In the case of both countries, there has been no exchange of ambassadors since 1962.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, former president and Bolivian representative in The Hague, disagreed with the opinion that the court's decision-making process was extremely quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a unique opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disputes for mutual benefit", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales  still one of Latin America's most popular presidents  was using the issue of access to the sea as a political game.
'Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,' he added.
The verdict is a great opportunity to see that we have to deal with the past.
North Korean leaders say that nuclear disarmament will not happen until they can trust the United States.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his nation will never get rid of its nuclear weapons as long as it can trust Washington.
Ri was speaking at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made at the Singapore summit between the leaders of the two countries.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears on the verge of resuming suspended nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says it's "a nightmare" that the lack of sanctions lifting and the US's opposition to the declaration ending the Korean War ever brought North Korea to its knees.
Washington is not willing to sign the declaration without Pyongyang taking concrete disarmament steps.
Both Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump want another meeting.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about eliminating the arsenal, which is seen in North Korea as the only measure to ensure security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month as part of preparations for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows herald the arrival of the latest line of large headgear in clothing stores.
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely shield yourself from the sun, we have good news for you.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne have launched a series of crazy, oversized headgear as part of their 2019 summer collection, which was all the rage during Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have been trending on Instagram this summer, and these designers have decided to show off their stunning creations on the catwalk.
Valentino's most notable work was a giant beige hat with a wide, feathered rim that covered the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included gem-encrusted watermelons, a wizard's hat, and even pineapple - but these were not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also showed off a series of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and were more Hannibal Lecter style than haute couture.
One of the creatures looked like a scuba diving kit with a tube and glasses, and the other looked like melted ice.
And if you don't want to break up with the big fashion, you're in luck.
Fashion observers predict that giant hats could be found in clothing stores.
The oversized hats follow right behind La Bomba, a straw hat with a two-inch-wide round that has been worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind the extremely impractical hat, which has been viral on social media, has unveiled another great creation on the runway  a straw beach bag almost as big as the model wearing it in a bathing suit.
A lit orange raffia bag, finished with raffia fringes and topped with a white leather handle, was featured in the Jacquemus La Riviera summer 2019 collection during Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, the star designer, told FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and beach bags to hit stores next summer. Because the designer has made such an impact, it would be hard not to capitalize on the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: language skills essential for world citizens
Independent schools in Scotland continue to enjoy academic success  In 2018, they boasted further excellent test scores, supported by individual and collective successes in sport, the arts, music and other social activities.
Represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), schools with over 30 000 pupils across Scotland strive to provide the highest level of service to pupils and parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen career paths and to indicate their role as global citizens.
As an education sector with the capacity to design and implement a curriculum tailored to the needs of schools, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable subjects for choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, "If you talk to another person in a language they understand, then it goes to their head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart.
It is a stark reminder that we cannot rely on English alone to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The results of the last exam this year show that languages are ranked first in league rankings, with the highest pass rates being achieved by independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received higher A's.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved an A above average in Mandarin, while 72 percent of German learners, 69 percent of French learners and 63 percent of Spanish learners also achieved A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, language learning as electives is taught in the same way as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects in the curriculum in independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 study by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17% of the reasons for employers' difficulty filling job vacancies were due to a lack of language skills.
Language skills are therefore increasingly becoming a necessity to prepare young people for careers.
These skills are essential in a globalised world with a growing number of jobs requiring language skills,
A lifelong skill, such as learning a second language, will provide a huge advantage in the future  regardless of the career path chosen.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically increases the chances of a multilingual person over the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults, 75% of them could not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, with French being the only language with a double-digit percentage of speakers, at 15%.
That is why investing in foreign language learning is so important for children today.
Knowledge of several languages, especially those of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding suitable employment.
In Scotland, each school will be different in terms of the languages taught.
Many schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered to be of major importance for the UK in the 2020s, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the child's interests, independent schools will always have a variety of languages to choose from, taught by specialised teaching staff.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating learning environments that prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed  no matter what the future holds.
Today, it is undeniable that in the international business environment, languages continue to be crucial to the future of a country, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be seen as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer a wide range of choice, diversity and level to Scottish young people.
It's just the way it's supposed to be.
John Edward, chairman of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron's Lakers debut is Sunday in San Diego.
Fans who wanted to see LeBron James debut with the Los Angeles Lakers finally got their chance.
Luke Walton, the Lakers' head coach, has announced that LeBron James will play in Sunday's preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
We don't know how many minutes he's gonna play.
"More than one, but less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play less than a minute.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six preseason games.
"At this point in my career, I don't need to be in pre-season games to prepare", he said.
Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is opening a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five Trump rallies planned for next week, with stops in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote confirming the stay of his nomination to fill a vacant Supreme Court seat, Trump is seeking to build support in the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the vote is cast in November.
What time is the Trump rally in West Virginia tonight and where can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia will be held at 7 p.m. today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's rally in West Virginia will be streamed live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak about this week's hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which have been held in a tense atmosphere over allegations of sexual misconduct, as well as the anticipated Senate vote to suspend the nomination for up to one week while the FBI investigates.
The main purpose of this series of rallies, however, is to provide support for Republicans facing a difficult November election.
So President Trump's campaign with five meetings next week is aimed at "mobilizing volunteers and supporters to help Republicans protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House".
"Control of Congress is such a high point on the president's schedule that as the hottest campaign season approaches, he will visit as many states as possible", said a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named  Reuters.
Today's rally at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media attention from Pittsburgh and West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia - a state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016 - for the second time in the last month.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican Senate candidate, Patrick Morrissey, who is losing in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey when the president comes to support him in the polls", Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows fighting spirit as they hold on to hope for victory in Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, the foursome format on Saturday afternoon might be just what the Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum is a completely fictional sporting concept, but one that the competitors really believe in, especially in events like this.
So what's their momentum like now?
"They're six points ahead, and now they're only four points ahead, so I think we've got a little bit of momentum", Jordan Spieth said.
Europe, of course, is four points ahead, with 12 to go.
The Americans, Spieth says, feel the wind in their sails and have good role models, especially Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spieth is a threat in every way and setting an example.
Throat-wide shouts of excitement grew louder as his round went on, sinking a key putt and winning the match as he and Thomas scored two holes in two at bats.
His ground kick that gave them a 15-0 lead was met with a similar "" shout that implies the U.S. team is still in play.
"You just have to focus and worry about your own game", Spieth said.
It's all that's left of each of these players.
18 holes to win.
The only players to score more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undeniable Ryder Cup history.
The strange but charming couple from the European team won four out of four and they were right.
The only couple to not hit a bogey on a Saturday afternoon, but also to avoid bogey on a Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on a Friday morning.
The way they play and the way their energy seems to flow both to and from the noisy crowd proves that these players are to be beaten on Sunday, and that there is no better player than Fleetwood or Molinari to seal a potential European team victory at Le Golf National.
It'd be best if they were playing different holes at the same time.
It is too early to say that the European team will win.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly played Sergio Garcia, the morning fourball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
Bogey and a double double on the front nine kicked the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they could never get out of.
On Sunday, there's no one to help you out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome are so fascinating because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and how strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead on the final day, but the foursome session also showed that the US team has a fighting spirit that some, especially in the US, have questioned.
Europe with a 10-6 lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe has a significant lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after winning 10-6 Saturday's fourball and foursome against the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari have taken the series, taking two victories over struggling Tiger Woods, increasing their record at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the underdog American team in the morning fourball format, winning the series 3-1.
The United States put up a stronger foursome, winning two games, but could not recover.
To retain the trophy, Jim Furyk's team must score eight points from 12 singles on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while along with Molinari (the team was named Molliwood after a sensational weekend) they are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in their opening four matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball style, they beat the pumped-up Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau in a stunning style, to an even more empathetic 5&4.
Woods, who has been exhausted for two games on Saturday, has occasionally shown glimpses of genius, but he has lost 19 of his 29 games in the fourball and foursome formats so far, seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was not a part of the morning fourball format, returned to Henry Stenson in the foursome format to beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka  who are ranked world No. 1 and No. 3 respectively.
But the European team was not at ease on that pleasant, cool day in a field southwest of Paris.
Three-time major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a new American record by scoring two points on Saturday.
They won a decisive 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourball format and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the four-ball format, losing the opening two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team made up a four-point loss by starting singles, although Fury's team would have needed only a draw to retain the trophy.
But with the second-place finish two days ago, a counterattack on Sunday seems unlikely.
North Korea says it is "not" ready for unilateral disarmament without trust.
North Korea's foreign minister said in a speech at the UN on Saturday that failing to lift sanctions only deepened North Korea's distrust of the United States and there was no way the country would unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test sites and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we don't see any concrete response from the US", he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there can be no guarantee of our national security, and under such circumstances, there can be no unilateral disarmament of North Korea".
While Ri reiterated North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's reluctance to take a "step-by-step" approach to denuclearization, whereby North Korea would be rewarded for taking steps in a step-by-step manner, his statement seemed significant because it did not reject unilateral denuclearization as it has in the past.
Ri was referring to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between the sitting US president and the North Korean leader, which took place on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim Jong Un pledged to work for the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" and Trump promised North Korea security guarantees.
North Korea had hoped for a formal end to the Korean War (1950-1953), but the US representative announced that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for easing tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The US insists on denuclearisation as a priority and is increasing pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal by force, even opposing signing the Declaration on the End of War, Ri said.
The belief that sanctions can bring us to our knees is the fantasy of people who behave ignorantly towards us.
The problem is that the lack of sanctions is deepening our mistrust.
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, which the US leader had talked about earlier this week at the UN.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim Jong Un and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding: "If the denuclearization issue had been a South Korean issue and not a US one, then there would not have been such a stalemate on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula".
Meanwhile, Ri's tone was completely different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's missile attack on US soil was inevitable after "Mr Evil President" Trump called Kim Jong Un "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
At the UN this year, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim Jong Un for his courageous steps toward disarmament, but also said there was still much work to be done, and said that sanctions would not be lifted until North Korea was rid of its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had not set a time frame for it, saying, "Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue and be uninterrupted until we have achieved complete, final and verified denuclearization".
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions on North Korea in an attempt to stifle funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month in preparation for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his most recent visit was not a success.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, and within hours North Korea denounced him for "making gangster demands".
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon Jae-in this month to dismantle its missile test site and nuclear complex if the United States took "appropriate measures".
He said Kim Jong Un told him that the "appropriate measures" he was concerned about were the security guarantees Trump pledged in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on proper rest.
A new course at Harvard University that was held this year provided more sleep for all students, which was designed to combat the growing macho culture of "all-night, caffeinated, student-driven learning".
Academic students at the world's best university often have no idea about the basics of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course he says is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create this course after giving a talk on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
And after I finished my talk, this girl came up to me and said, "Why are you telling me this now when I'm a senior?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the meaning of sleep, which surprised me", The Telegraph reported.
The course, which was held for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep habits help students to perform well in academics and sports, as well as improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health service, said the decision to introduce the course came after it was discovered that students had been suffering from severe sleep deprivation for a week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
One section includes a picture of a dorm room where students click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how sleep deprivation affects athletic performance, and the importance of sleeping regularly.
In another section, participants learn how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to reflect on their daily routine.
We know that this will not immediately change student behavior.
But we believe they have a right to know  just as everyone has a right to know about the health effects of smoking, added Professor Czeisler
The culture of pride in "all-night school" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students means a growing problem of sleep deprivation.
Getting enough good quality sleep should be a secret weapon for students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, and even prevent weight gain, because lack of sleep causes the brain to go into starvation mode, leaving the student constantly hungry, he said.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chesler develop the course after attending one of his classes last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a campus-wide course.
The next step, he says, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar degree programme before moving to a competing institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set an alarm to remind them when to go to bed and when to get up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disturb the circadian rhythm and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers:
The Rangers suffered another setback in the Livingston outfield fight when Dolly Menga's shot defeated Steven Gerrard's dismantled team 1-0.
The Ibrox Stadium side were looking to record their first win since a 4-1 victory over St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's side beat Gerrard for the second time in 18 games, giving his side an eight-point lead over Ladbrokes Premiership leaders  Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes into the first half, and the Rangers' lack of commitment didn't look like it would improve.
While Rangers recorded a drop to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third  just behind Hibernian with a single goal to spare.
The Rangers may be in trouble again after they had to treat linebacker Calum Spence's head wound after he was hit by an object thrown from the visitors' stand.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which allowed Ayr to get past and advance to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went through with the same Livingston XI that took a point off the Hearts last week, being delighted with the way his well-trained team wore down their opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have dominated possession, but it was Livingston's team that did more with the ball once they got it.
They should have scored in the first two minutes when Menga's first pitch allowed Scott Pittman to take on Alan McGregor, but the assistant missed his shot.
Keaghan Jacobs then threw a deep free throw to captain Craig Halkett, but his teammate Alan Lithgow, who was playing fullback, could only stay in the backfield.
The Rangers regained control in the third quarter, but it looked like they had more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he deserved a penalty fifteen minutes into the game when he and Steven Lawless bumped into each other, but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's claim.
Rangers managed to get only two shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely concerned with Lassana Coulibaly's head and a weak shot by Ove Ejarria.
While Livingston's 34th-minute opening goal could have been the game's undoing, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort they put into scoring it.
Once again, the Rangers failed to cope with Jacobs' deep-seated, steady play.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher threw the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his composure, passing it to Mengi for a simple finish.
Gerrard did not waste the break and traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent  this trade almost immediately affected the winger who threw the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly managed to block it by coming from his position.
Livingston's team continued to pull the visitors into the game exactly as they liked it, with Lithgow and Halkett making long passes one after the other.
Holt's team could have increased the lead in the final minutes, but McGregor put himself well ahead of Jacobs, after which Lithgow put the game away from the corner.
Rangers reserve Glenn Middleton was once again hoping for a penalty when he got mixed up with Jacobs, but Thomson looked the other way again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882. 136 years ago today, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually led to the invention of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has become a part of science and pop culture, as seen in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", which starred these seemingly unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
What the hell is that?
Rogers: It's a Geiger counter used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you'll hear the effects of the atoms emitted by radioactive minerals.
Now you hear something!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name has survived to this day.
A new cancer vaccine could teach your immune system to recognize hostile cells.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to recognize and destroy hostile cells.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize the enemy cells as part of the treatment.
This is a technique that involves extracting immune cells from the patient and replacing them in the lab.
And then they can detect a protein that's common to many cancers, and then they inject it back into the body.
The trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
One woman who received a vaccine that taught her immune system to recognize hostile cells had her ovarian cancer disappear after more than 18 months.
The method is to take immune cells from the patient, change them in the laboratory so that they can ' detect ' a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then inject the cells back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that this vaccine is working very well".
HER2 "drives the growth of several cancers", including breast, ovarian, lung and colon, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach, taking immune cells from patients and learning how to locate cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West is going on a pro-Trump rant on Saturday Night Live with a MAGA hat on his head.
It didn't go too well.
Kanye West was "exploded" in the studio during a Saturday Night Live performance after he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing his third song, "Ghost Town", that night, wearing a "Make America Great" hat, he delivered a speech against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
Every time I talk to white people, I hear, "How can you like Trump?
If I cared about racism, he said, I would have left America a long time ago.
SNL's show opened with a Matt Damon sketch in which the Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before a Senate Judiciary Committee regarding sexual assault charges brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, a video of West performing was posted to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West by posting the post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that behind the scenes he had problems with his hat.
They've been after me behind the scenes.
They told me not to go out with that hat on my head.
They're after me!
And then they say I have no choice", he told the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "You're saying I have no choice?" adding, "I'm going to put on the Superman cape so you can't tell me what to do.
Let's just accept it.
His words twice caused a "huge" cheer in the audience, and the SNL crew members looked embarrassed, reports Variety.
West was invited to the show to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West intrigued many by performing the song I Love it in a Perrier water bottle costume.
West was backed by the head of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest: Thank you for standing up to the Mafia.
Talk show host Karen Hunter said on Twitter that West was just being himself and that's absolutely great.
However, I will NOT reward anyone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their art) who I believe accepts and promotes an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And we are free, she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he was now "officially named Kanye West".
However, he is not the first artist to change his name  following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Friendly rapper, Snoop Dogg, adopted the name Snoop Lion, and music legend, Prince, changed the name to the symbol, and then the artist formerly known as Prince.
Attempted murder charge in a stabbing at a Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after stabbing a man in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The accused is due to appear in the court of first instance in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the prosecutor's office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington is raising the issue of toxic masculinity .
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO series Game of Thrones, set in medieval times.
The 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that showing such roles on screen often makes young boys think they have to play tough guys to be respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said something went wrong and he wondered how to deal with the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones partner, 31-year-old actress Rose Leslie, admitted that he felt "quite confident" about bringing up the subject.
"I personally feel pretty confident at this point in the story of where did we go wrong with the manhood?" he said.
What did we teach men growing up to see in the context of the problem we face today?
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the development of toxic masculinity because of its portrayal of very masculine characters.
He continued: "What attitudes are innate and what are learned?
What is it that is taught on television and on the streets that makes young boys feel that they have to take a certain side to be a man?
I think this is one of the most important issues of our time. What can be done to change this?
It's clear that there's something wrong with young men.
He also admitted in an interview that he would not be playing in any Game of Thrones prequel or sequel after the series ended the following year, saying that he was done with battlefields and horses.
Starting in November, Kit will star in Sam Shepard's True West, which is a story about a film producer and his brother, a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose the best thing that has ever happened to him in Game of Thrones.
"On set I met my wife, which gave me my future family and a new life", he said.
In this multiple Emmy Award-winning fantasy series Rose played Ygritte  the object of love interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China records 14 percent increase in new cases
China reported a 14 percent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected, according to the country's health officials.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, around 40 000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in parts of China through transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been almost completely reduced, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year on year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sexual contact is a major problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Given the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of disease transmission are due to inadequate protection during sexual activity in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has made HIV drugs available to everyone as part of its efforts to combat the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that any member of her team who leaked the data of Republican senators is a "dangerous lie" and a "conspiracy theory".
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday rejected allegations that a member of her team posted the personal information of three Republican senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
A Los Angeles Democrat said the accusations were made by experts and websites linked to the far-right.
"Lies, lies and even more vile lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information was posted online on Thursday by an unknown person at the Capitol during a Senate panel hearing on sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came some time after Kavanaugh's candidacy was challenged by three senators.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was linked to Waters' office and published information about a member of Waters' team  as Hill reports.
"This baseless allegation is completely false and is a 100% lie", Waters continued.
A member of my team whose identity, privacy and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations was not responsible in any way for the leak.
This baseless accusation is completely false and it is a 100% lie.
Waters' statement prompted criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This kind of denial is wrong", wrote Fleischer.
It suggests she doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone's accused of something they didn't do, they can't be angry.
He can't be provocative.
He cannot question the motives of the accuser.
But he needs to stay calm.
Fleischer seemed to be comparing Waters' response to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of exhibiting excessive anger during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate running in the midterm elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Tough case if true", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified "the appropriate authorities and law enforcement of these fraudulent allegations".
"The perpetrators will be exposed and held legally accountable for any actions that pose a threat to any member of my team", she said.
Johnny English: Knockout is a spy parody with a weakened Rowan Atkinson.
Looking for references to Brexit in every new British-themed film has become the norm, and this seems to be the case with the new installment of the Johnny English action-comedy series, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to theaters in 2011 with Johnny English: Reaction.
Will the self-deprecating satire of how hopeless we are become the country's new export commodity?
Anyway, the perpetually surprised, rubber-faced, incompetent Johnny English has been given his license to perform again. His name more than anything else indicates that he is a sophisticated comic for non-English speakers.
He's, of course, a stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre taste for smoothie glamour, has a little bit of Inspector Clouseau, a pinch of Jasi Fasoli and a drop of this guy adding a note to the melody of the lead theme of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
He was also a traveller and a world mystery man in the past. Atkinson once starred in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, which left a mess.
In the latest film in the Johnny English series, there's one or two moments that are noteworthy.
I really liked the scene where Johnny English approaches the helicopter wearing medieval armor while the blades of a rotor beat rhythmically on his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is clearly visible on screen, but his sense of humor seems to be rather low-key and unnecessary, especially now that even "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible offer comedic elements as a film component.
The humor seems to be directed more at children than adults. I find Johnny English's wild adventures not as inventive and coherent as the gags in Atkinson's silent Jasi Bean films.
The assumption has always been that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker infiltrates Britain's super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents operating in the area to the horror of the on-duty agent, Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately played a small role.
It's the final straw in the bitter spell of a prime minister who is a pompous, wasted character already suffering from a nervous breakdown caused by a lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson does everything in her power to play Theresa May, but the script doesn't give her the opportunity to spread her wings.
Her advisers at the intelligence agency inform her that, because of the revelation of the identities of all active spies, she will have to reinstate one of the retired agents.
And that means the incompetent Johnny English himself, now employed as a teacher at some fancy school, giving off-the-record lessons on how to become a secret agent  some nice gags while giving English a spy lesson.
English is called to Whitehall for a briefing, reuniting with his former assistant Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man involved with the submarine commander of a cheerful but somewhat tired character played by Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin of Her Majesty's Secret Service team up again, meeting the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously taken over by a charismatic tech-crazed billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems.
English and Bough begin their crusade of absurd situations: waiters dressed as waitresses set fire to a French restaurant; they cause chaos by smuggling themselves aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English wreaks havoc while using a virtual reality kit to explore Volta's home.
In this last sequence, all the restrictions disappear, but despite the pleasant and loud performance, the whole film is very much like children's television.
Typical middleweight.
As with the other films in the Johnny English series, I couldn't help but wonder if the British film industry couldn't give Rowan Atkinson a role that really matched his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is developing a plan to give the British people a four-day workweek, where they will be paid in five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan to make the British work four days a week and get paid for five.
The party reportedly wants business leaders to pass on the savings made by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to their employees by giving them an extra day off.
This would allow workers to enjoy a three-day weekend with the same pay.
Sources say the idea fits into the party's economic program and plans to take the country out to meet workers.
The shift to a four-day workweek was supported by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party member told The Sunday Times: "We expect a policy change to be announced before the end of the year".
It will not happen overnight, but the four-day workweek is part of the Party's approach to restoring the economic balance to the benefit of the worker, as well as the Party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first party to support this idea  The Green Party committed to a four-day work week during the 2017 election campaign.
At present, however, these plans are not supported by all Labour Party members.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'The four-day workweek is not a policy of the party and is not being considered by it.'
John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, used last week's Labour Party conference to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from faceless CEOs and "speculators" in public utility companies.
The Chancellor's plans from the shadow cabinet also mean that current shareholders of water companies may not get their full share back because the Labour government could make deductions based on the fraud detected.
It also confirmed plans to place employees on company boards and to set up integration equity funds to transfer 10 per cent of the equity of private sector companies to employees who receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy respond on 60 Minutes to a question about whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week and raised questions about whether the bureau's findings could prompt Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview with 60 Minutes on Sunday, Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI had discovered anything that might change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Of course", said Kennedy.
On my way to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when the charge came up, and I said, "Did you do that?"
He was firm, decisive and unambiguous.
Graham's opinion, however, seems to be set in stone.
"I've made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh, and to change it, it takes a strong indictment", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett has strongly denied it", Graham added, addressing Christine Blasey Ford.
None of the people he reports could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anything will change.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
Next Saturday in New York City, the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that boasts an impressive lineup of performing stars and an equally impressive mission to eradicate poverty around the world.
The seventh annual Global Citizen Festival will draw tens of thousands of people to the Great Lawn in Central Park to not only enjoy performances by celebrities like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to support the event's most important goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international group of activists working to fight poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless they chose to buy a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or other meaningful activities to help raise awareness of the goal of eradicating poverty.
But what successes can Global Citizen boast in the 12 years to go?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince them to demand action, or is it another case of so-called "clicktivism" where people feel they are doing something important by signing an online petition or posting a tweet?
Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million actions since 2011 in support of a wide range of causes.
It also says that these efforts have helped to motivate world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
The Group has also provided information on the financial situation of the Group and its financial position in the Union.
The group estimates that the measures have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and entrepreneurs committed to "helping children reach their full potential", which pledged $35 million to help Rwanda tackle malnutrition in the country after Global Citizen members sent more than 4,700 tweets.
Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizen members like you, we can make social injustice like malnutrition a thing of the past  Tracey Ullman, Power of Nutrition ambassador, at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 campaigns calling on the UK to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government has announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children with malnutrition.
One of the most frequently asked questions on their website was, "How can we be sure that we will end extreme poverty?"
Global citizen responded: It will be a long and difficult road  We will stumble and fail at times.
But just like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements of the past, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the stars performing at this year's event in New York City, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to block Russian energy exports.
Washington can "use its navy if necessary" to prevent the flow of Russian energy to markets, including those in the Middle East, US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke has revealed  Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia's involvement in Syria  especially where it is acting at the invitation of the legitimate government  is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason they are in the Middle East is to mediate energy trade, as they do in Eastern Europe", he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
The US Navy has the ability to ensure that sea lanes remain open and, if necessary, to create blockades to ensure that their energy does not reach the market, he said.
Zinke was speaking at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that describes itself as the voice of the energy consumer in the United States.
He also compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, noting that in reality they are the same.
The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels he said, comparing Russia to a "one-trick pony" with a fossil fuel economy.
The statements come as the Trump administration continues its mission to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe , which is a much cheaper option for European consumers compared to Russian gas.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to back down from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has made Berlin "a slave" to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double its existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is purely economic and an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position provoked a strong reaction from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I think it's a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply", Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator from Massachusetts, said she's considering running for president in 2020.
Elizabeth Warren, senator from Massachusetts, said Saturday that she would consider running for president after the midterm elections.
At a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering her candidacy.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix a broken government, including the highest office", she told The Hill.
After November 6th, I will consider my candidacy for president.
During the meeting, Warren mentioned President Donald Trump, saying he was "leading the country in the wrong direction".
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's constituents do not believe she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters who chose the "probably" option said the senator should not run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy  38 percent of people supported his potential candidacy, while 48 percent were against it.
Other prominent names in the Democratic camp being considered for the 2020 nomination are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'll make a formal decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin speaks about the PTSD of Track Palin at the rally for Donald Trump .
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the Army in September.
He was arrested Monday night and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, what he has to go through when he comes home, I understand other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and the injuries that our soldiers are coming back with", she told an audience at Donald Trump's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her son's arrest a taboo subject, and then she said of her son and other war veterans: They come back a little changed, they come back hardened, they come back wondering if they will be respected for what their fellow soldiers, airmen and all other members of the military have given to their country.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, soliciting false testimony on a domestic violence report, and possession of a firearm while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the fight against new asylum policies
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed an amicus brief in Washington on Friday in support of an asylum seeker struggling with the policy , NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in the lawsuit Grace v. Sessions, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy, has not been released.
She said that her partner and his brutal gang members abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Prosecutors in the states supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which have large numbers of asylum seekers in the United States, as countries with widespread gang and domestic violence problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, the District of Columbia Attorney General, said in a statement Friday that the new policy ignores decades of state, federal and international law.
'Federal law requires that all asylum applications be examined on the basis of specific facts and circumstances, and such a prohibition violates that principle', as stated in the amicus curiae brief.
Prosecutors further argued in the letter that the policy of denying immigrants entry harms the U.S. economy, claiming that they can become entrepreneurs and "create a necessary workforce".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic and gang violence.
Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear on account of their race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political belief  said Sessions in his statement on 11 June on asylum policy.
Asylum was never intended to solve all the problems  even the serious ones  that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly tragic.
"It's a very intense feeling", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her feverish son at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute an ambulance brings in a body.
There's no clean water.
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, searching for water-soaked items and trying to salvage anything they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and hospitals quickly overcrowded after the 7.5-magnitude quake.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered fractured spines and a broken arm, were resting outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were being treated outside for severe secondary concussions.
Tears filled his eyes as he related the violent earthquake that shook his hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I've been pushed into the rubble of the wall. Harris told The Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for a wedding.
I heard my wife scream for help, then her voice went quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe.
The US ambassador accuses China of harassing us with propaganda.
A week after the official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the paid supplement of China Daily in the Des Moines Register  Iowa's most popular newspaper  accusing China of trying to interfere in the US congressional elections on November 6  China denies the allegation.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in the U.S. election confirmed what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise their trade with each other, Beijing and Washington are now waging an escalating trade war that has led to higher tariffs on each other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were meant to hit exporters in states like Iowa that backed Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major agricultural exporter to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businessmen.
Branstad wrote in a Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register that China is now starting to harass with double force by placing propaganda ads in our own free press.
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's cherished tradition of free speech and free press by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
But the street kiosk in Beijing will not be a voice of protest and will not truly reflect any of the divergent opinions that Chinese people may have about China's troubling economic direction given that the media is under the strong control of the Chinese Communist Party.
He added that one of China's most prominent newspapers refused to publish his article, though he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans are alienating women with voting rights ahead of the midterm elections over the Kavanaugh affair, analysts warn.
While many leading Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple sexual assault charges, analysts warn that members of the court will face a backlash in the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The emotion surrounding this event is extremely high, and most Republicans are now officially ready to vote.
"It's irreversible", said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona's last-minute efforts to get the FBI to investigate would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow and they will not forget until November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, on Friday, according to the Washington Post.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming", demonstrating in the Senate chamber over the decision by Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee not to withdraw Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic said.
The level of democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be beyond measure  said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst at one news website.
People say he was tall anyway, and it's true.
But it can be higher, especially among undecided suburban women and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29 who, while not liking the president, often don't vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which she detailed her allegations of sexual assault against a Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that if Republicans decided to endorse her candidacy, it could be met with a backlash.
"The Republican Party is in a mess", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, as reported by NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh gets elected, it's also about how the Republicans handled the situation and how they treated Ford", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told a news conference.
However, Americans seem to be a little divided about who to believe in the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with the latter having a slightly greater following.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents strongly or somewhat believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they strongly or somewhat believed Kavanaugh's testimony.
In addition, 38% of respondents said that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI launched an investigation into the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, who is Deborah Ramirez , as reported by The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh, under the influence of alcohol, assaulted her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals at a Yale University student reception in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to compete with the platforms of Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project from the tech legend, Inrupt, is a company building on the open source  Solid platform owned by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who can access specific information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal of Inrupt was "world domination".
"We have to do it now", he said, referring to the startup.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid platform technology to allow people to create their own personal online store, or POD.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all coming together in one browser at the same time.
A unique feature of a personal data online store is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who has access to what information.
The company calls it "personal data empowerment".
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is to provide the resources, processes and skills to help make the Solid platform available to all people.
Today, the company includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, developers around the world were able to create their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change that will turn all their business models upside down overnight.
Don't ask them for permission.
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial power and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a very active participant in the debate over net neutrality.
With the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm extremely excited about the next era of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Priest awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I
The only Church of England clergyman to be awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I was commemorated 100 years later in his home town.
Colonel Bernard Vann was decorated on 29 September 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing he had been awarded Britain's highest military decoration.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said the unveiling of the stone on the 100th anniversary of his grandfather's award was "extremely symbolic".
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal in very thick fog and under heavy field and machine gun fire.
He then rushed to the line of fire and with "the greatest courage" led it forward, then single-handedly attacked the field gun positions, neutralizing three of them.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4th, 1918  just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I could never do, but something humble".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, laid the wreath at the end of a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honoured" to be part of the parade, adding that the courage of a true hero is reflected in the support he receives from many people.
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch the Bellator 206 gala, and instead got Piglet Peppa.
Imagine staying up all night to watch the emotionally charged Bellator 206 gala and ultimately not being able to see the main event.
The San Jose show featured 13 matches, including six on the main card, and was shown live overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to fight, viewers in the UK were shocked to see the programme changed to Peppas Pig.
Some were disappointed after staying up late to see the fight.
One Twitter fan described switching to a children's cartoon as some kind of sick joke.
"Under government regulation, this type of content is not suitable for 6am, so we had to switch to a children's show", said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
Peppa Pig, yeah. I know.
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said they would refine the schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"When I think about repeating the situation, I think we can fix it", Coker said.
But it's Sunday morning at six, so we won't be able to deal with it until Sunday, our time, and Monday, their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the show changed there, we were flooded with comments, none of which sounded friendly.
We tried to fix it... we thought it was a technical glitch.
But it wasn't a glitch. It was a legal issue.
I can promise you this will never happen again.
We're going to limit the program to five fights instead of six, which is the standard number, because we were too busy trying to please the fans, and unfortunately we overstayed our welcome.
This is an unfortunate situation.
Tom Daley felt worse about his sexuality.
Tom Daley, Olympic diving champion, says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize that not everyone was like him until he went to high school.
On Radio 4's Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give others hope.
He also said that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The longtime host of the show, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to illness.
Appearing on Laverne's show for the first time, Daley said that growing up, he felt less valued than others because "liking boys and girls at the same time was not socially acceptable".
He said, "To this day, that feeling of being less than and different is what gives me the strength to succeed".
He said he wanted to prove he was worth something so he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent LGBT activist and used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he chose to speak out because he felt happy to be able to live openly, without any implications, and he wanted to give hope to others in this way.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with the man he met in 2013 - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black - was "surprising".
Daley married the Oscar winner (who is 20 years older than him) last year, noting that the age difference was never a problem for him.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" He was referring to his first Olympics at 14 and his father's death from cancer three years later He said it was hard to find anyone his age who had experienced similar ups and downs
The couple became parents in June of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, who Daley said has completely changed his perception of things.
"Last year, the most important thing for me was to win the gold medal", he said.
And you know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son shares the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father couldn't accept that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics.
"I couldn't tell him, 'You're not going to be with us to be in the front row, Dad,'" he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was only when he stopped breathing and died that I realized he wasn't invincible", he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life - jumping in front of a crowd of people at the Olympics - it was the best feeling I could have had", he said.
It also inspired him to choose the first song  Proud by Heather Small  that accompanied him during the preparations for the Olympics and which still gives him goose bumps.

Showing Mickelson out of shape on the bench during Saturday's Ryder Cup game.
American Phil Mickelson will set a new record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he'll have to work on his form to keep his mark.
Mickelson, playing in his 12th year at the biennial event, was sent off by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's four-ball and foursome games.
Instead of being in the center of the action, as he often was on the U.S. team, the five-time major champion had to spend the day doping his team and working on improving his game in the hope of fixing the reason he was sent back to the bench.
The 48-year-old, who never delivered a clean sweep, even at the peak of his career, is not doing well on the cramped Le Golf National course, where misses are mercilessly punished by long roughs.
And if the field itself isn't daunting enough for Mickelson, in Game 9 on Sunday, he must face the precision of British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who has joined forces with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans (with four points down in the first 12 singles) start the game with a verva, Mickelson's match could be extremely crucial.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his competitor. There was nothing else he could do.
"He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, gave me a hug and said he would be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
He's very sure of himself.
He's in the Hall of Fame and he's done a lot for his teams both in the past and this week.
I didn't think he'd play two games.
I thought there'd be more, but that's what happened, and that's what we had to do.
He wants to play all the time, just like everyone else.
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for Ryder Cup matches played on a Sunday.
It could mean the end of his Ryder Cup career, which never matched his individual achievements.
Mickelson has a record of 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, and Furyk said his presence has been a great asset to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, ridiculous and it's nice to have him in the team room", he explained.
I think the younger players have been having a good time with him this week, which was nice to see.
He's a lot more than just a game.
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a big points lead could soon be shrinking.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant lead before the singles start on the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a tough match.
The Dane made his debut in 1997 in a match at Valderram, where he and his fellow vice-captain, Seve Ballesteros, had a five-point lead over the Americans, but crossed the finish line by the shortest possible hair, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"We had a big lead at Valderram Field, we had a big lead at Brookline Field, we lost, and we won by a hair", said Bjorn, pictured, after a 5-3 Class of 2018 win both Friday and yesterday, giving us a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
Time will tell me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
You're gonna give it your best shot tomorrow.
Get out there and do it right.
It's not over until the dots come up on the board.
We have a goal, which is to win the trophy, and that's what we need to focus on.
I said from the beginning that I'm focused on the 12 players who are on our side, but we also know very well who the people on the other side are.
Bjorn, impressed by the way his players handled the difficult field, added: "I couldn't have done it better.
But tomorrow's different.
The singles start tomorrow, and that's a whole other matter.
It's good to play with a partner when everything's going your way, but when you're playing solo, your golfing skills are tested to the limit.
That's the message we need to send to the players, to give it your best shot tomorrow.
The partner must also give his best.
Jim Furyk, unlike Bjorn, will expect his players to perform better in singles than in partnership, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself experienced a major twist on the final day of action as a member of the winning team at Brookline Field, before being defeated after the European team performed a miracle at Medina Field.
"I remember every word", he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, was preparing his players for the fight on the final day.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, and you want to get started on the fast track like we did at Brookline Field and Medinah Field.
If this push goes one way, it's gonna put a lot of pressure on the midfield.
We've set up our lineup and set up the boys in a way that will allow us to enchant tomorrow.
Thomas was tasked with leading the counterattack, facing Rory McIlroy in the main match, as well as Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter  other European team players in the front half of the programme.
"I chose this group of guys in this order because I think they can handle the whole tournament", Bjorn said of his singles choices.
The new German warship is delayed again
The German Navy's newest frigate is due to enter service in 2014 to replace aging Cold War warships, but will not be until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising costs  as local media reported.
The commissioning of Rheinland-Pfalz, the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate, has been postponed to the first half of 2019, Die Zeit newspaper reported, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was due to enter service in 2014, but problems after delivery made it necessary to make changes to this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the ageing Bremen-class frigates.
They will of course be equipped with a powerful gun, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and non-detection technologies, such as radar, infrared and acoustic traces.
Other important features include longer maintenance intervals  new frigates should be able to operate for up to two years away from home ports.
But the constant delays mean that these modern warships, which are designed to enable Germany to respond to situations abroad, will be obsolete by the time they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially declined to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the yard after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the withdrawal, but German media reported a number of key software and equipment flaws that made the ship unusable in combat missions.
The software flaws were particularly significant, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships are to be manned by a crew of around 120 seamen, half the size of the older Bremen class frigates.
It also proved to be too heavy, which reduced its performance and limited the ability of the Navy to carry out future modernization.
The 7,000-tonne ship Rheinland-Pfalz is thought to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by Germany during World War II.
In addition to the faulty equipment, the cost of the entire project  including the training of the crew is also a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering EUR 3.1 billion (USD 3.6 billion) when the initial cost was EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems of commissioning new frigates are particularly significant in light of recent warnings that the German navy is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the navy was running out of usable ships.
He also said that the problem had been exacerbated over time by the retirement of old vessels without replacement vessels.
It also expressed its dissatisfaction that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could be incorporated into the Navy fleet.
The National Trust is eavesdropping on the secret lives of bats
New research on a farm in the Scottish Highlands aims to show how bats use the landscape to forage.
The results of the study are expected to shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
The research by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will involve common and small dwarfs, as well as long-eared brown bats and red-eared bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct field tests using portable detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings is to determine the frequency of the bat signals and the behaviour of the species.
A habitat map and report will then be developed to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour at landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser at the NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management activities, such as grassland management, and the best ways to maintain forested areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined dramatically over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development, which affect the rocks and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting systems can also pose a threat, as can fly rods and certain chemicals used in building materials, and even domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more helpful than their eyes in catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to search for worms and obstacles in their path.
NTS, which is responsible for over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
It is made up of ten trained experts who regularly conduct inspections, inspections of the hives, and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organisation even established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threave Manor in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, the property manager, says it's the perfect bat territory.
Threave has a great bat area, he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and great habitats.
But there's still a lot we don't know about bats, and the work we're doing here and in other facilities will help us better understand what they need to thrive.
It stresses the importance of bat control before any conservation work is undertaken on holdings, as the accidental destruction of one litter can kill up to 400 females and young, leading to the extinction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected  killing, harassing or disturbing them and destroying their nests is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, officer of the Scottish Bat Conservation Trust, urged the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many species, we don't even know how their populations are doing".
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while his lawyers plan to sue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations against him "fake news", saying people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers plan to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portuguese Juventus forward was accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
According to Der Spiegel on Friday, the footballer was supposed to pay the woman $375,000 to keep quiet.
Ronaldo, 33, called the allegations "fake news" in an Instagram live message to his 142 million followers hours after the charges were announced.
No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to do this.
Today's reports are fake news, said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner.
They want to promote themselves using my name.
I'm not seeing anything new.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but that's part of my job.
"I'm happy and everything is fine", the footballer said with a smile on his face.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel magazine over what they call "unacceptable reporting of privacy concerns", Reuters reports.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the footballer will seek damages for "moral damage" in an amount commensurate with the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a hotel room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the football player's room, where he allegedly raped the woman anal, according to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was 99% a good guy who was deceived by the 1%
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that the hospital took pictures of her injuries, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she feared retaliation and "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old says she wants to cancel the settlement now because she still can't get over the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was on the move from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and this summer he moved to Juventus for a fee of €100 million.
Brexit: Britain would always regret leaving the carmakers
Britain would forever regret losing its status as the world's leading carmaker after leaving the European Union, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that he was "disturbed" when a Toyota UK representative told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, production at the Burnaston plant near Derby would be temporarily halted.
"We need a deal", Clark said.
A spokesman for the Japanese carmaker said the effects of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces the Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my view, if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March without a deal, then production at our plant will be halted", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director in Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers fear leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade works, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW is going to close down its Mini car factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are  what carmakers say  the supply chain risks of a no-deal exit for the UK.
The Toyota production line operates on a 'just-in-time' basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and EU for custom-built cars.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, there could be difficulties at the border, which industry officials say could lead to delays and parts shortages.
According to a company spokesman, Toyota would not be able to last more than a day without supplies to its Derbyshire plant, which would halt production.
Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely designed to avoid border controls".
"We need an agreement, we want to reach the best possible agreement, which will not only allow us to enjoy our current success, but also allow us to make the best of it", he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The statements not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we must be able to continue what was a very efficient set of supply chains.
Toyota was unable to say for how long production would be halted, but warned that in the longer term the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant, leading to a reduction in employment.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at the Burnaston plant for 24 years and is a member of the Unite union board, said union members were becoming increasingly concerned: "I know from experience that once jobs are eliminated, they will never be restored.
A government spokesman said: 'We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union'.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says.
Donald Trump's crucial meeting with Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be delayed another week due to the ongoing battle over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating possible Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump's close associates and Russia, and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, thus threatening Mueller's independence, has been a hot topic in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president from office under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein has denied these reports.
But last Monday, he went to the White House in the face of reports that he was resigning.
The meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid interfering with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that included testimony from Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "No date has been set for this meeting yet, it could be this week, or it could be moved another week, given all the events surrounding the Supreme Court.
We'll see. I'll be sure to report it to the press.
Several journalists have questioned the statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said the small number of press conferences was not due to a dislike of "proud" TV journalists, adding: "I won't hide that they are proud".
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The current President is holding more Q&A sessions than any other President before him, she said, adding without providing evidence: "We have seen the numbers".
Press conferences will continue, Sanders said, but "if journalists are allowed to ask the president of the United States questions directly, it's a much better solution than talking to me".
We're trying to do this regularly, and we've done this a lot in the last few weeks, and press conferences are going to be replaced by these sessions where you can talk directly to the president of the United States.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are a rarity.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why by behaving too casually and sometimes strangely in front of a gathering of reporters.
The Minister of Health writes to EU staff at NHS Scotland in the face of Brexit concerns
The Minister for Health has sent a letter to EU health workers in Scotland to express their gratitude to the country and to ask them not to leave after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter less than six months before the United Kingdom left the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of processing applications for settled status for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote: "The negotiations on the UK's exit from the European Union continued over the summer and the final decision will be taken this autumn.
The UK Government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very troubled time for all of you.
I would therefore like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring in valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the way healthcare works and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoing surgery for a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christion Abercrombie underwent surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's game against the Vanderbilt Commodores, which ended in a 31-27 loss to Tennessee, Mike Organ said.
Rod Reed, head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the player suffered an injury just before the end of the first half.
"He went to the sideline and then he slipped to the ground", Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline, then placed him on a stretcher and carried him out for further testing.
A Tennessee State representative told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was being operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that he doesn't yet have any details on the type/size of the injury, and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie (a sophomore exempt from representing the university for a year to hone his skills) is playing his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
Saturday night before the game, he had five sacks, which gives him 18 sacks for the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax when buying property in the UK
Under the Tories' new plans, foreign buyers will be charged higher tax on property purchases in the UK, with the proceeds going to help the homeless.
This move is intended to nullify the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract a younger electorate.
The tax increase will cover people who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury estimates that this will raise up to £120 million a year for homeless relief.
Theresa May will announce today that foreigners buying property in the UK will be charged a higher tax rate and the extra money raised will go towards helping the homeless.
The move is seen as an attempt to undermine Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters with promises of cheaper housing and to increase the burden on higher earners.
Higher tax rates will be imposed on individuals and businesses not paying UK tax, and additional measures are to help the government tackle homelessness.
The additional charge  charged on top of the current tax, including the higher rates for second homes and rented apartments introduced two years ago  may be as high as 3%.
The Treasury expects this move to raise up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by residents of other countries, which drives up prices and makes it difficult to buy a first home or apartment.
As many foreigners buy property and spend most of their time abroad, many affluent regions  and especially the capital  have become ghost towns.
The new rules come just weeks after Boris Johnson called for tax cuts to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large property developers of keeping property prices high by taking up land but not using it, and called on Prime Minister May to lift the cap on affordable housing to end the UK's "housing scandal".
Jeremy Corbyn has announced a number of attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to evictions without cause.
It also wants to give local authorities more power to build new homes.
Theresa May said: "Last year I said that as Prime Minister I would commit myself to rebuilding the British dream of making each generation's life better than the last.
It also means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
But it's not fair that non-residents, as well as foreign companies, can buy property here as easily as hardworking British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become very far away, but the humiliation of having to sleep on the streets remains all too real.
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to be Scotland's national team manager".
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become Scotland manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is committed to working to heal the North-East, who are currently third in League One with a three-point deficit against the top team.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to represent my country as a player,
But I only got into the B-side, Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
As a child, I often went to Scotland's games with my father in Hampden and I was always drawn to it.
But that opportunity will only come if I succeed as a club coach.
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he's not intimidated by taking on such a high profile role at such a big club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Right now, my success will be measured by whether I can get this club back into the Premier League.
Given its structure and the facilities it has, it certainly belongs there", he adds.
It won't be easy to do, but I'm sure I'll feel like I've made it here, if I can do it.
Ross's coaching career has only been going on for three years, having previously been an assistant coach at Dumbarton and a member of the Hearts coaching staff for 15 months.
He then helped Alloa to promotion back to League Three after relegation, and the following season he led St Mirren from the brink of relegation to the Championship.
Jack Ross says he feels much more comfortable now than when he played for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was a real turning point", recalls Alloa when he took up the coaching job.
I really believed that leading a team was a better fit for me than playing.
This may sound strange, but I was a successful athlete, earning a good living, and having some measurable success.
But playing is a tough piece of work.
Every week, you have to go through different situations.
I still have them when it comes to the stress and pressure of coaching, but I'm comfortable in that role.
I've always wanted to coach, and I'm doing it now, and I can say that this is the most important moment in my entire adult life.
The full interview on Sportsound can be heard on Sunday, September 30th on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST
Studies show that the best time to drink beer is 5:30 on a Saturday.
The summer heat wave has caused a surge in customers to the UK pubs, but it has also hit restaurant chains.
The survey showed that pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, but restaurants saw a 4.8 percent decline.
Peter Martin of the consultancy CGA, which compiled the data, says: "The continuing heat and longer than expected England's World Cup run have caused the July results to be similar to June, when pubs grew by 2.8 percent, with the difference that restaurant revenues fell even further.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant sales in June was further amplified in July.
Drinking pubs and bars fared better  their sales growth outpaced the decline in restaurants.
Pubs serving food also suffered during the heat, though not as much as restaurant owners.
It looks like people were just thirsty.
Sales of drinks in managed pubs and bars rose 6.6 percent this month, while food  fell 3 percent.
Paul Newman, from RSM, a travel and leisure industry analyst, says: "These results are in line with the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The most important factors influencing the volume of consumption outside the home remain weather and large sporting or social events.
The fact that the restaurant chains are having a hard time is not surprising, although the 4.8 percent drop in sales from a year ago will have particularly dire consequences given the ongoing pressure to cut costs.
The long, hot summer has come at the worst time for food service owners, and time will tell if the slightly warmer temperatures we had in August will bring much needed relief.
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand growth.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which tracks sales in the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of over £9 billion, setting recognised industry standards.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they keep from their parents
Studies show that one in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 primary school students found an increase in fake Instagram sites
The news has raised concerns that it contains sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said they had a main account that they showed their parents.
One in five children - some as young as 11 - have social networking accounts that they do not disclose to adults.
A survey of 20,000 primary school students showed a rapid increase in the number of fake Instagram accounts.
The news has raised concerns that these accounts are used to post sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students admitted to having a "main" account that they showed their parents, and they also had private accounts.
One mother who stumbled upon her 13-year-old daughter's private website encountered a teenager who was urging others to rape her.
A survey of independent schools by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) found that 40 per cent of pupils aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, and half of them admit to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, president of the HMC Association, says: "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are creating their own sites online that parents and teachers can't find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of the sport at Scottish Athletics.
At the annual general meeting of Scottish Athletics, Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board as a non-executive director.
Eilidh Doyle is Scotland's most decorated female athlete, and the sport's president, Ian Beattie, described the move as a great opportunity for those in charge of the sport to benefit from her rich international experience gained over the past decade.
'Eilidh is highly respected in the Scottish, UK and global athletics communities and we are confident that bringing her on board will bring great benefits to Scottish athletics,' said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I am very excited to be able to give the council a voice for athletes, and I hope I can really help govern sport in Scotland".
An American who, among his four Olympic gold medals, won the 200- and 400-meter dashes at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and now regularly appears on the BBC as an expert witness, is unable to walk because of a transient anemia attack.
He tweeted: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time would tell if and to what extent I would regain my strength.
It was hard work, but I made a full recovery, learned to walk again, and returned to training!
Thank you for all your words of support!
Lactation advertising that compares mothers to cows is stirring up extreme emotions on the Internet
A company that makes lactating animals caused an Internet storm by running an ad that compared breastfeeding mothers to milking cows.
To promote the launch of "the world's first silent breast milk bottle for underwear", its manufacturer, Elvie, released a teasing video ad that highlighted the freedom it provides mothers.
It shows four real mothers dancing in a haystack to a song that includes the words: "Yes, I can breastfeed, but you can't see my tail" and "If you haven't noticed, it's not just my boobs".
And the chorus goes, "Pump it, pump it, I'll feed the kids with it, pump it, pump it, I'll breastfeed my lady".
The ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked a huge online controversy.
The video has now been viewed 77,000 times and received hundreds of comments, with users expressing extreme opinions, many of whom say it is inappropriate to joke about the dairy industry's horror.
Using cows to advertise this product was a very bad idea.
Like humans, they have to get pregnant and give birth to a calf to give milk, except that their babies are taken away from them after a few days of birth one user wrote.

Another person commented: "It's obviously traumatic for both mother and child.
Sure, let's use cows to advertise lactators for mothers who can keep their babies.
Another added: "This ad is completely out of touch with reality.
Others defend the video  one woman said she thought the song was "funny".
I think that's a brilliant idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
When I sucked the food out, I felt like a cow.
The commercial is a little crazy, but I'm not looking for the bottom line.
It's a brilliant invention. Someone wrote it.
Another commented: "It's a funny ad for mothers who suck up food (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like cows".
It is not intended to praise or criticise the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, we see the women dancing with their breast implants discreetly attached to their chests.
The campaign was inspired by the idea that many breastfeeding women feel like cows.
However, the Elvie lactator is completely silent, has no cables or tubes, and can be worn undetected under the breastplate for feeding, giving women the freedom to move around, hold their babies, and even leave the house while sucking.
Ana Balarin, partner and creative director at Mother, said: "The Elvie Lactator is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By comparing women who are feeding and dairy cows, we wanted to show all the challenges of withdrawal, while also presenting in a fun and coherent way the incredible sense of freedom that it provides.
This isn't the first time Elvie's lactator has made the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, during a show by Martha Jakubowski, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk with this very product.
Hundreds of immigrant children were secretly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of immigrant children being detained is rising rapidly, even though the number of people crossing the border each month is virtually unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies of the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children with sponsors.
Most sponsors are also undocumented immigrants who are afraid of being deported if they go to pick up their child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adults living on the same farm would be fingerprinted and handed over to immigration authorities.
Last week, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, Matthew Albence, testified before Congress that his agency has already arrested dozens of people who have come forward as sponsors for unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior record.
Nearly 80 percent of people who are sponsors or live in the same household are in the country illegally, and a large proportion of them are foreigners with criminal records.
That's why we're always chasing them", Albence said.
Shelter workers say that in an effort to speed up the process of regulating the children's situation, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained  instead of 60 days as was the case under previous standards.
Many will be coming in via video conference, rather than in person, to ask the immigration judge to legalize their status.
Those who do not qualify for parole will be deported immediately.
According to shelter workers and reports that have been published in recent months, the longer children are in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which in turn can lead to outbursts of aggression or attempts to escape.
Advocates said the problems are even more serious in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where its size makes it easier to overlook signs of harm.
They also said that sending children to a tent camp without providing them with adequate time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can exacerbate the trauma many of them are already dealing with.
Syria calls on the US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are on Syrian soil illegally under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "we will deal with them accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the Assembly.
Moualem says the war on terror is almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have been forced from their homes.
He says Damascus will continue to "fight its holy battle until the territory of Syria is cleared of both terrorist groups and all foreigners who are in the country illegally".
Currently, there are approximately 2,000 US troops in Syria, primarily training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrians opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
And there are still over 1,000 French soldiers in the war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said conditions were good enough for them to return, and accused "some Western countries" of "inciting irrational fear" that discourages them from returning.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to help with these returns", he said.
They politicize things that should be purely human.
The United States and the European Union have warned that until President Assad reaches a political agreement with the opposition to end the war, Syria will not receive any reconstruction aid.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has opened the door for continued political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey helped prevent a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province of three million people.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement has a "clear time frame" and expressed hope that military action will be directed at jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Levant People's Defense Front, who will be "eliminated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new commission of ruling party and opposition members soon to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare for elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the provisions of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump is going to win reelection
According to this logic, President Trump would be elected to a second term in 2020 unless - as many liberal observers are likely to hope - his presidency ends early in impeachment and scandal.
It would be, without a doubt, the most dramatic end to the presidency so far.
So far, there's no sign of the audience getting tired.
Since 2014, CNN's prime time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million viewers, and MSNBC's  has nearly tripled to 1.6 million viewers.
Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers during peak hours, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show is the highest-rated cable program, with 3.5 million viewers watching evening news.
"People fly like moths into fire. This is something we don't understand". Neal Bear, executive producer of ABC's "Designated Survivor", said about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the Capitol attack.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has a different theory.
She remembers driving a cab in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he's going to vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"Because you make me laugh", he said.
Chaos is entertaining.
Of course, the reports from Washington could be seen on television as anything that could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, the legality of immigrant family reunification, or the state of the global economy.
Being off is a luxury only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Besides, it's not just about being a well-informed citizen when you watch a panel of experts at 6 p.m. debate Bob Woodward's use of secret informants in writing his book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich jacket (a garment laden with pride as The Washington Post called it), or the shocking implications of Stormy Daniels' revelations of details of President Trump's anatomy.
I, for one, will never look at Super Mario the way I used to.
What he does is partly like a reality show in that he delivers new content every night, said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about the changing cast and the daily twists and turns of Trump's show's action (such as attacking NFL players or praising Kim Jong Un).
You can't afford to miss the episode, because you're gonna be behind.
When I met Mike Fleiss this week, the weather on the north shore of Kauai, where he has his house, was beautiful, but he was sitting inside watching MSNBC and recording CNN at the same time.
He couldn't get away from it, not when Brett Kavanaugh was standing before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was on the line.
"I remember when we used to do all these crazy shows and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
I thought they were joking, but they were right.

The flow of outside money into the congressional campaign
Not surprisingly, after a reorganization of the electoral districts, which has left two incumbents in the race for one seat, a stream of cash is flowing into Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District.
This newly created Pittsburgh suburb is represented in Congress by Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is competing with another current congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania's former 12th district, which largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
The county maps were corrected after a January ruling by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court that the old counties were unfairly designated, giving the Republicans an advantage and being unconstitutional.
The race for the new 17th District began with a campaign finance battle between the party's main funding bodies  the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb gained popularity in Pennsylvania after winning by a narrow margin in the widely-publicized election for the 18th Congressional District in March.
This seat has been held by a Republican for over a decade, and Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but withdrew from the idea.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, despite a slight objection from Washington.
In June 2017, President Donald Trump had a cordial meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varella, and until his expulsion by partners of the Trump Organization management team, he had a hotel in Panama.
State Department officials have decided to recall the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over "recent decisions to withdraw recognition of Taiwan", State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement this month.
However, the sanctions under consideration were only intended to be imposed on El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including for drug control and economic and development support.
The proposed sanctions, which would include restrictions on financial aid and visas for certain individuals, would be very hard on the Central American country, which has high unemployment and a high murder rate.
As international meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to address the findings of a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
In mid-September, top administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, thus ending any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Diplomats say Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to speak at the conference, which is currently scheduled for mid-October, in a sign of inviting the administration to a meeting.
Three American envoys have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any further harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for John Bolton declined to comment on details of the debate, which was presented by three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal negotiations on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an outside analyst from the administration, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Learn about history
Another possible element is a report by special counsel Robert Mueller on possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, for which concrete evidence is now publicly available.
According to reports, Robert Mueller's investigation also examines whether Donald Trump's campaign had anything to do with Russia's attack on the US election.
If Congress changes its composition, President Trump will be held accountable by Congress as he prepares to re-enter the House, and perhaps even be tried by a jury.
There are many unknowns here, and I don't want to suggest that the fall of Trump  or his peers in Europe  is inevitable.
We all on both sides of the Atlantic have a choice to make that will determine how much longer this can go on.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler if the West would resist him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
It failed, and we lost the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The tracks of history turn around such turning points, speeding up or slowing down the inevitable march of democracy.
The Americans are facing a number of these tipping points.
What are we gonna do if Donald Trump fires Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom the future of the Robert Mueller investigation depends?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since we revealed in our newspaper that he offered to record the president's secret video last year and speculates that he's not qualified for the office.
According to Rosenstein, the Times' account is inaccurate.
How will we respond if the newly-commissioned FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh turns out to be incomplete or unfair or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite credible charges of sexual assault and perjury?
And most importantly, will we elect people to Congress in the middle of the presidential term who will hold Donald Trump accountable?
If we don't pass these tests, it's going to be a tough time for democracy.
But I believe we can do it because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew, deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's residence.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that table marked with a swastika.
With a legacy like this, how can I not look to the future with optimism?

Rangers player Graham Dorrans is looking forward to the game against Rapid Vienna.
Rangers take on Rapid Vienna on Thursday with the understanding that a win over the Austrians, after an impressive draw with Villareal in Spain this month, will significantly increase their chances of qualifying for Europa League Group G.
Up until the 2-2 draw with Villareal, a knee injury kept assistant Graham Dorrance out of the game this season, but he believes the result will act as a springboard for the Rangers to greater success.
"It's good for us because Villarreal are in good shape", said the 31-year-old.
We went into this game with the belief that we were going to make something and we scored a point.
Maybe we could still push them in the end, but overall, a draw is probably a fair result.
The Spaniards were probably better in the first half, but in the second half, we were better.
As for Thursday, it's another big night for Europe.
We hope to get three points, but this match will be difficult because our opponent has achieved a good result in his last match, but I am sure that with the support of the fans we will pass and win a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough with everything to do with my injury and the changes at the club itself, but now we're all feeling good in our seats.
The team is great, and the boys really like to play.
I hope we can move on, put the last season behind us and be successful.
Fear of retirement savings is keeping women awake
Although the respondents knew exactly how they wanted to be cared for, few talked to their families about it.
In a Nationwide survey, about half of the respondents said that they had discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't talk about it", said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance for Nationwide.
Where do I start?
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not prepare your family to care for you if you do not first express your wishes.
Discuss with your counselor and family where and how you would like to be cared for, as that choice will be a major factor in determining the cost.
Ask a financial adviser: He or she can help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Long-term care funds can come from a traditional long-term care policy, a hybrid policy that allows you to pay cash to cover such expenses, or from your own assets  if you have one.
Prepare legal documents, and you'll avoid a legal battle.
Appoint a trusted health care representative to supervise your care and to make sure that appropriate people follow your wishes if communication becomes impossible.
Consider also hiring a financial representative.
Choose a trusted person, who will make financial decisions for you and make sure that all bills are paid if you are unable to do so yourself.
Remember the details: Imagine that your elderly parent suddenly needs medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.

A man shot multiple times with a windmill in Ilfracombe.
A man was shot multiple times with a windmill as he was returning home from an evening party.
The 40-year-old was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe in Devon when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Officers have ruled the shooting, which took place at around 02:30 BST, an "accidental act".
The victim didn't see the assailant.
The man's injuries are not life-threatening and police are asking for witnesses to report the incident.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
Officials say at least 384 people have died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the disruption of communications, rescue workers were unable to get any information from Donggala, a township north of Palu, closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the Palu disaster.
Here are some key facts about the city of Palu and the capital of Donggala on Celebes Island:
Palu is the capital of Central Celebes, a province located at the end of a narrow bay on the island's west coast.
The earthquake and tsunami struck just as the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a kabupaten (lower-level administrative unit) stretching along the northwest coast of the island for more than 300 km.
The estimated population in 2017 was 299,200.
The main sectors of the economy of Central Celebes are fishing and agriculture, which have developed especially in the coastal kabutan of Donggala.
Another source of income for the province is nickel mining, but these are mainly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, earthquakes and tsunamis have struck Palu and Donggala several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami struck Donggala, killing more than 200 people and destroying hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a tsunami in western Donggala killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, and earthquakes occur there quite regularly.
The biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake that struck the western coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake hits southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that slammed into the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
It killed over 1,100 people.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hits the Mentawai Islands off the coast of Sumatra, causing a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroys dozens of villages and kills about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hits the Pidie Jaya kabupaten in Aceh province, causing destruction and panic among people still recalling the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, there was no tsunami wave, but the collapsing buildings killed over 100 people.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
They have destroyed thousands of homes and caused temporary hardship to thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, a 29-year-old man from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on charges of domestic violence, obstruction of justice and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, when a friend of the suspect tried to call the police to report a crime, he took her phone.
KTUU station reports that Palin is in Mat-Su's custody and has a bond of $500.
According to her, he appeared in court last Saturday, where he stated in his defense that he was "absolutely innocent".
Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, which means she could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He's also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which carries a maximum penalty of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin's been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
That's when his mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Court of Veterans' Claims.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of justice and possession of a firearm while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His partner says he hit her in the face.
In 2016, veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin for linking her son's aggressive behavior to PTSD, which he acquired while serving in Iraq.
Hundreds of people have died in the tsunami after an earthquake in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are down and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near the central part of the island of Celebes, which is northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Videos of the moment of the disaster are circulating on social media.
When the tsunami hit the coast, there were hundreds of people on the beach at the festival in Palu.
Federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayful Saipov, suspected of carrying out the terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, a rare death sentence that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
In an October attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, 30-year-old Saipov allegedly used a rented Home Depot truck to drive pedestrians and cyclists into the street.
According to the notice of intent filed in the Southern District of New York to seek the death penalty, to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov intentionally killed eight victims and intentionally inflicted serious bodily harm.
According to court documents, both of these charges carry the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in the course of illegal activity , a procedure usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases , and one count of assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors said the attack required "solid planning and thought" and described Saipov's conduct as "heinous, cruel and immoral".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleaves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlija, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damiano Pagnucca  the notice of intent states.
Five of the victims were Argentine citizens who were in New York City on a tourist trip.
The last time the death penalty was imposed in the Southern District of New York was ten years ago.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug dealers, but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last federal death penalty was carried out in New York in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple executed two years earlier for conspiracy and espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, who is from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the months following the attack.
Police say he told investigators he felt good about what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov confessed to authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by ISIS videos he was watching on his phone.
According to police, he also demanded that the ISIS flag be hung in his hospital room.
He pleads not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal prosecutors representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty and refuse life without the possibility of parole after pleading guilty will only prolong the suffering that these events have caused to all concerned", he said.
Saipov's defense team has asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should take responsibility for Brexit negotiations
At today's protest, which took place at the Tory conference, Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the people's army".
A former leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) said politicians must "feel the heat" from Eurosceptics when one of Theresa May's MPs suggested she should take responsibility for negotiating with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that if Farage had been Brexit secretary, "the UK would already be outside the EU".
However, the Tories' joining the city's separate anti-Brexit protest has further underlined the burden of reconciling their deeply divided ranks that Theresa May faces.
The Prime Minister is struggling to implement her compromise plan with Chequers amid attacks from Brexit supporters, opponents and the European Union itself.
Her allies say she will push for a deal with Brussels despite opposition and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her proposal and "chaos".
Peter Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wants to throw the plan out of Chequers.
He suggested that Nigel Farage should be appointed as an authorised representative and be given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would be outside the EU by now", he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I support Brexit, but we have to throw the plan out of Chequers".
In his opposition to the European Union, he said: "We did not fight the world wars to be subject to anyone.
We want to stand up for ourselves in our own country.
Peter Bone dismissed suggestions that the public has changed its mind since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to stay in the EU is completely untrue".
Also at the rally was Andrea Jenkins, a pro-Brexit Tory who told reporters: "I'm just saying: Madam Prime Minister, please listen to the people.
The Chequers plan has no public support, the opposition will not vote for it, neither does our party nor our activists who populate the streets and who elected us.
You can drop the Chequers plan and start listening.
In a statement to Prime Minister May, she added: "Prime Ministers keep their promises when they keep their positions".
Nigel Farage said politicians taking part in the demonstration must "feel hot" if they are to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's a matter of trust between us the people and the political class", he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them we won't let you do it.
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make the politicians who are on the verge of betraying Brexit feel warm.
"We are mobilizing the people's army of this country, which gave us victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become an independent, independent, proud United Kingdom".
Meanwhile, anti-Brexit protesters marched through the city centre for a two-hour demonstration.
A handful of activists waved "Tory Against Brexit" banners after the group formed this weekend.
Labour activist Baron Andrew Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the security problems with the party's app at the start of the conference.
"These are people who say they can organize the IT systems and all the technology to support the Canada plus plus plan, the smooth border, free trade with Ireland", he added.
This is a complete sham.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit", he added.
Elizabeth Warren is planning to seriously consider running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "seriously consider running for president" after the November election.
The Massachusetts Democratic congresswoman spoke about her future at a rally in western Massachusetts on Saturday, reports The Boston Globe.
Elizabeth Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican Representative Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in the 2016 election.
Now, there's talk that Warren could beat Trump in the 2020 election.
Saturday's event in Holyoke was her 36th town hall meeting with voters since Donald Trump took office.
One of the participants asked if he planned to run for president.
Elizabeth Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government and she meant a woman at the top.
Arrest for the fatal shooting that killed LSU quarterback Wayde Sims.
Baton Rouge, Louisiana police said Saturday they have arrested a suspect in the shooting that killed LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department reports the arrest of 20-year-old Dyton Simpson during a press conference that took place at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time.
A video of the shooting was released Friday asking for help identifying the man seen on it.
20-year-old Wayde Sims was shot and killed outside the Southern University campus Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head with a gun, killing him", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told 247sports.
Wayde defended his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, carrying a gun, and shooting Wayde.
After being apprehended without resisting arrest, he was taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
The 6-foot-3, 190-pound junior from Baton Rouge played in 32 games, including 10 starts, last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
The Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton moves closer to the world title after team captain Sebastian Vettel won the race
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified against Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team's leadership would have a big impact on the outcome of the race.
Bottas, who started from the first field, started very well and almost beat Hamilton, defending his position in the first two laps and forcing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went down to the service point first and allowed Hamilton to drive in the tail of the peloton, which should decide the race.
The Mercedes driver came down to pit on the next lap and appeared behind Vettel, but after a round-the-clock action in which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside of the track, risking being pushed into the defensive after a double move by the rival to defend his position at turn three, Hamilton took the lead.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the grid and on his 21st birthday at the end of lap one he was seventh.
He then led for much of the race by not changing tyres to make a quick finish and take fourth place from Kimi Raikkonen.
He finally went down to the service point on lap 44, but he was unable to accelerate for the remaining eight laps.
It was a tough day because Valtteri had been doing a great job all weekend and he was a real gentleman when he was asked to let me through.
The whole team did everything they could to take the first two places", said Hamilton.
That was really bad body language.
During a meeting on Saturday, President Donald Trump lashed out at Senator Dianna Feinstein, who maintained that she had not disclosed the contents of a letter from Christina Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Christina Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead said that what was happening in the Senate showed that people are "devils, vicious, and liars".
"What could have happened is one thing, but this beautiful situation in the Senate that we've been witnessing for days, when we see anger, when we see people who are angry, mean, mean and lying", he said.
We see what's been published and leaked, and then they tell us, "Oh, I didn't do it".
I didn't do it.
Do you remember?
Dianna Feinstein, did you leak this?
Remember her answer... did you release the contents of this document?
Oh, no, I'm not going to.
I didn't tell her.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Did we reveal... No, we didn't reveal", he added, warning the senator.
Dianna Feinstein received a letter from Christina Ford detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh in July, and the contents of the letter were leaked in early September.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's insinuation, I did not reveal her story", Feinstein testified before the committee, reports The Hill.
She asked for my discretion and I did not disclose the contents of the letter.
Her statement did not convince the president, who said during a meeting on Saturday: "I tell you, that was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continuing to defend a Supreme Court nominee who has been accused of sexual harassment by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats are using the insinuations to their advantage.
They are determined to seize power by any means necessary.
They show meanness, malice, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to destroy to take power and control", the president said, according to Mediaite.
The Elite League: Dundee Stars  Belfast Giants 5 and 3
In a game against Dundee, Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants.
The Dundee Stars have made up for their Elite League defeat to the Belfast Giants on Friday by winning Saturday's rematch at home by 5:3
The Giants quickly took a two-goal lead on shots by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the score, and Dwyer took the Giants back into the lead.
Francois Bouchard again tied the score, scoring a goal for Dundee, followed by two goals from Lucas Lundwald Nielsen to seal the victory.
This was the third defeat of the Elite League season for Adam Keefe's wardens, who despite their initial loss on Friday night won 2-1 against Dundee in Belfast.
This is the fourth time the two teams have met this season. The Giants have won their first three games.
Dwyer's opening goal fell in the fourth minute (3:35) after Kendall McFaul's assist.
After an intense opening at 13:10, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game, and then Matt Marquardt tied the score at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the first half when he scored his second goal of the night late in the first quarter.
The home team was re-grouped and Bouchard again tied the score with a goal scored in the lead in the 27:37 minute.
At the end of the second third, Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen to give Dundee their first lead of the game, and the final victory was sealed in the mid-final third by the same player who scored his team's fifth goal.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will play their next game on Friday at home in Milton Keynes.
An air traffic controller dies while helping hundreds of people on a plane escape an earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller has been hailed a hero after he died helping a plane with hundreds of people on board take off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are still missing after a massive earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
The area is still experiencing strong aftershocks, with many people trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues were fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wobbly control tower at Palu's Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He stayed behind to ensure that Batik Air flight 6321, which was now on the runway, took off safely.
Then he jumped off the tower when he thought he was about to collapse.
He died in the hospital.
According to Australian broadcaster ABC News, Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the controller's decision may have saved hundreds of lives.
We arranged for a helicopter to fly him from Balikpapan, Borneo, to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, Anthony left this morning before the chopper reached Palu.
"We are heartbroken to hear this news", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, and the National Disaster Management Agency says access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"We believe the death toll is still rising as many bodies are still under the rubble and inaccessible", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Six-meter-high tsunami waves devastated Palu, where a mass funeral for the victims will be held on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft are delivering aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Ambulances are constantly bringing bodies.
We're running out of drinking water.
Small shops are being looted.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we don't know what to expect on the ground.
This is a tragedy, and it could be worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the military: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready? CNN is reporting.
This year, an earthquake has already struck Indonesia, killing more than 550 people on the island of Lombok.
Air Niugini reports one person is missing after plane crashes in a lagoon
The airline that operated the plane that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific says one person is missing, after earlier saying all 47 passengers and crew members had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said it could not count one man who was traveling on a dangerous plane as of Saturday afternoon.
They said they're working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find him.
However, they did not immediately respond to requests for additional details on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
After the plane crashed into water while trying to land at Chuuk Island's airport, local boats helped rescue the remaining passengers and crew.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six more passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
It's not clear what caused the crash, nor is it clear how it happened.
The airline and the United States Navy say the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses say he slipped out of his belt.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was approaching very low.
"It helped us a lot", he said.
Jaynes said he and others managed to get through the water that reached the runway to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the crew members panicked and screamed, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working nearby to modernize the waterfront were also helping with the rescue operation, using a inflatable boat to transport people to shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 100 feet [30 m].
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in Papua New Guinea-registered airline crashes in the past two decades, but Air Niugini is not among them.
The analyst reconstructed the events of the night the woman was burned alive.
On Saturday, prosecutors completed the presentation of evidence in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
A U.S. Justice Department analyst, Paul Rowlett, testified for hours as a forensic expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone records to reconstruct the route of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, from the night she was killed.
According to the Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said he had obtained location data from various cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night of the murder, thus refuting his earlier claims.
When the records confirmed that while Quinton was supposed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, his cell phone was with Jessica Chambers, the police decided to question Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When asked by the prosecutors if Tellis was telling the truth about being in Sanford's truck that night, he said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville that night.
Another inaccuracy is Tellis' claim that he's known Chambers for about two weeks.
Cell phone records show they've known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers died, Tellis deleted her phone contact information, as well as text messages and phone calls.
"He cut her out of his life", Hale said.
The defense's final statement is scheduled to begin Sunday.
The judge said that the case will probably be referred to the jury later that day.
The High Breed  What is hip-hop conscious of?
A hip-hop trio wants to change the negative image of the genre by filling their music with a positive message.
According to Bristol-based group The High Breed, hip-hop today has moved away from its original political and social content.
The band members want to go back to its roots and restore the popularity of conscious hip-hop.
With artists like Akala and Lowkey, there's been a recent revival in the UK of artists like The Fugees and Common.
Another black one?!
A nanny in New York is suing a couple for firing her after a racist text.
A nanny in New York is suing a couple for firing her from a job on a racist basis after receiving a wrong-addressed text message in which the baby's mother complains that she is "just another black person".
The couple denies being racist, likening the lawsuit to "blackmail".
A mother of two, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, was clearly shocked when it was revealed that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, who had come to work on her first day of work in 2016, was black.
"NeeEE, another black person" she texted her husband.
But instead of sending him to him, she mistakenly sent him to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, when Plasco-Flaxman realized the mistake, it "dismissed Gisela Maurice in disgust", claiming that the warm-hearted nanny, who is African-American, was not doing her job properly and was expecting a nanny from the Philippines.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for her day's work, and then she was sent home by Uber.
Now she's asking the couple for severance pay of $350 a day multiplied by the six months she was originally employed as a resident, even though she didn't sign a contract.
"I want to show them that these things don't happen", she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple denies the accusations of racism, saying that the termination of their relationship with Mrs. Maurice was justified because after they insulted her, they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her.
My wife sent her something she wasn't going to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist", said Post's husband, Joel Plasco.
Would you trust your children to someone you've hurt, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn child?
Come on, you guys.
Comparing the lawsuit to "blackmail", Plasco said his wife had given birth just two months early and was in "a very difficult situation".
You're gonna blow up something like this?
That's not very nice", the investment banker added.
Although the court case is not over yet, the public quickly issued a verdict on the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and thinking.
A new letter reveals that the publishers of the Paddington books were concerned that readers would not feel a connection to the talking bear.
The author's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book's warm reception, says of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very funny now that we know what we know about Paddington's great success.
She says her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before a teddy bear inspired him to write a children's book, was sure his work would be rejected, adding that after his death last year, the 60th anniversary of the book's publication seems "bitter-sweet".
She says of Paddington, who she describes as a "very important member of our family", that her father was secretly proud of his success.
"He was a quiet man, he didn't brag", he adds.
But because Paddington seemed so real to him, it was almost like having a child who had accomplished something, and you feel proud of him, even though it wasn't your doing.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although he invented and created it himself, he always credited Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly and said it was really bad, that he probably wouldn't make it", says Tanya Ednan-Laperouse.
Then he called to say Natasha was gonna die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
I did it anyway.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much".
I'll be with you in a minute.
I'll be right there.
The medications that doctors gave her to keep her heart beating slowly stopped working and were excreted from her body.
She died a while before that, and that was the end of it.
I could only sit and wait, knowing that this was all unfolding.
I couldn't howl or scream or cry because I was surrounded by other people.
I had to really hold on.
Finally, Tanya Ednan-Laperouse, who had already mourned the loss of her daughter, boarded with other passengers, unaware of her suffering.
"No one knew", she said.
I had my head down and I was crying all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt a deep compassion for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Postcards from grieving women to help prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide try to dissuade others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are placing postcards on Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers for people to reach out for help.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he became depressed, and he took his own life at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day", she says.
Sharon Davis, 45, of Lydney, says that her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
Everybody knew his smile.
They always said he could light up any room with it.
But before he died, he quit his job because he was in a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother was 11 years old, and he was the one who found his brother when he killed himself.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm still worried about the domino effect.
Sharon Davis created the cards to tell people that there are people they can turn to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't sit there and talk to someone.
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, lost her partner of 15 years, Mark, shortly after her mother died.
He didn't say anything about feeling down or sad or anything.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
By Christmas, he was in a complete hole, and when the kids opened their presents, he didn't even look at them.
He says his death was very painful for them, but they had to deal with it: "It's a big hole in the family.
He's tearing us apart.
But we must live and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI opens an investigation
"I thought if we could actually get what he was asking for  a limited-time, limited-scope investigation  maybe we could reach some kind of consensus", Jeff Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "splitting into opposing camps, leading to a stalemate".
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
All their aversion is to the moment.
The congressional elections are only a few weeks away on November 6th, and if, as predicted, the Republicans lose, the chances of a particular person being elected to the highest court in the land will be significantly reduced.
George W. Bush was already picking up the phone to call the senators and get them to back Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was the president's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI makes a report?
The Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will vote on the bill.
It's not clear if Brett Kavanaugh will get at least 50 senate votes, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the deadlock and bring him to the Supreme Court.
Under Kim, the number of North Korean refugees is declining.
According to a South Korean lawmaker, since Kim Jong Un took power seven years ago, the number of people fleeing North Korea to South Korea has fallen.
Citing data from the South Korean Unification Ministry, Park Byeong-seug said that 1,127 escapes were reported last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
He said the key factors that have contributed to this situation are the increased border controls between North Korea and China and the higher rates charged by human traffickers.
Pyongyang has not made any public statement on the matter.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul authorities, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, making it easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often forcibly returns them to their country.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still in a state of war, have improved markedly in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss denuclearization negotiations that had previously stalled.
This follows a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore in June, which resulted in a general agreement to work towards the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of not making progress on the issue.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no certainty about our national security, and under these circumstances, there is no way we can unilaterally disarm ourselves first", Ri said in a speech he delivered to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh a "hysteric" and says he's not qualified to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was not naturally qualified to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks during an interview she gave Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin.
"I think if a woman behaved like this, she would be considered hysterical", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations of alleged sexual abuse of Dr. Christina Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At times during his opening remarks, Kavanaugh showed strong emotions  almost screaming and losing his speech when discussing family matters and high school years.
He also sharply chastised the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him "grotesque and a coordinated reputational attack" orchestrated by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she felt Kavanaugh's testimony showed he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because it exposed his bias against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself by making those statements, as well as the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
Asked if she would seek Kavanaugh's removal from office if he won the nomination and the Democrats won a majority in the House, Pelosi hesitated.
"I'll say this: if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he shouldn't not only be on the Supreme Court, but he shouldn't be on the court he's on", she said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's possible rulings on the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade because he is considered a conservative judge.
During his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time to bring into court a hysterical, prejudiced person who expects us to say 'But it's wonderful,'" Pelosi added.
And women must master it.
It's a fair diatribe, months and years of rage pouring out, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Gloria Stein told me 45 years later.
I guess that's pretty common, huh?
She said, "Well, I had a great help from a woman who was a manager at a company, and she said that she cries when she's angry, but she's got this way of saying, when she gets upset and starts crying, she says to the person she's talking to, 'You must think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm pissed off.
And he keeps doing his thing.
I thought it was brilliant.
Tears are acceptable as an outlet for anger in part because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of one of my first jobs in a male-dominated office is of crying out of anger one day when an older woman -- a cold manager I had always been a little afraid of -- grabbed me by the neck and led me up the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", she said.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they're happy to see you hurt.
Patricia Schroeder of the Democratic Party, then a congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with his mistress on a boat called the Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, frustrated to the point of frustration, Patricia realized that she might actually consider running for president on her own.
"It was a poor decision", she told me, laughing, 30 years later.
There were seven other candidates up for election and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone described this situation as "Snow Queen and the Seven Dwarfs".
Since the campaign had been going on for a long time, Schroeder was running behind schedule on fundraising and promised herself that she would not enter the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a battle to be lost.
She discovered that some of her followers who had given men $1,000 had only $250 for her.
Do they think I'm getting a discount?
During the speech announcing that she would not be running a formal campaign, she was so filled with emotion  gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and reach voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism  that her voice got stuck in her throat.
"You'd think I'd have a nervous breakdown", he says of the press's reaction.
You'd think I'd be sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember wondering what they'd write on my tombstone.
She was crying?
What benefits can be gained by a U.S.-China economic war?
The fallout from the US-China economic war has been deafening, and while the battle is still raging, in the long run the conflict between the two countries could be to Beijing's advantage, experts say.
The first warning was issued by US President Donald Trump this year, imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week after new tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods were imposed, taxing half of all goods entering the US from China.
Each time, Beijing has retaliated in kind, recently raising tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. goods from five percent to 10 percent.
China is determined to respond to any US strike and it doesn't look like the world's second largest economy is going to retreat anytime soon.
Forcing Washington to back down means accepting the demands, but publicly bowing to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressure from the trade war with the US could strengthen China in the long run, reducing the dependence between the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for economic chaos in any country is actually far more dangerous than observers have previously acknowledged said Abigail Grace, Asia researcher at the Center for New American Security think tank.
According to the foreign minister, Syria is ready to accept the return of refugees.
The government says Syria is ready for the refugees to return voluntarily, and is asking for help in rebuilding the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In his speech to the UN General Assembly, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
'The situation in our territory is now more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,' he said.
In an effort to restore normalcy, the government is continually rebuilding areas destroyed by terrorists.
All conditions have been met for the voluntary return of refugees who have been forced to leave the country due to terrorism and unilateral economic moves aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million people have fled Syria since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living there are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be happy to accept help in rebuilding the destroyed country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept conditional or offered aid from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe seals victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the US team 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris.
On European soil, the United States lost for the sixth time in a row and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the trophy when, under the leadership of Danish captain, Thomas Bjorn, they scored 14.5 points, which was all they needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had been down for most of the tournament, hit a pitch ball straight into the water on the 16th hole of the PAR3 and gave the game to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari was brilliant through all rounds and became one of only four players to reach 5-0-0 since 1979 when the tournament was first held in its current format.
American Jordan Spieth was eliminated by a score of 5&4 by the lowest ranked player from Europe, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who is the world's top-ranked player, lost two holes to England's Ian Poulter, who may have had his last Ryder Cup.
The European with the most Ryder Cup victories is Sergio Garcia of Spain, who has won eight Ryder Cups and scored a career-high 25.5 points.
I don't usually cry, but tonight I can't help it.
It's been a rough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for believing in me and choosing me.
I'm so excited to get the trophy back.
It's a success for the whole team and I'm glad I could help", said Garcia, who was moved after the team's victory in Europe.
He hands the bat to his compatriot, John Rahm, who on Sunday defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods in a singles match, 2-1.
"I feel incredibly proud to have won against Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him play", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost every game in France and now he's 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
That's an unprecedented statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had a hard time finding a runway all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at a really high level throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing performance of the American team, their captain, Jim Furyk, said, "I'm proud of the guys, they fought.
At some point this morning, we pushed some Europeans.
We're backing off.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
We're gonna change the lineup, and together with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, we're gonna find a way to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
I have a lot of admiration for my opponents.
They played a lot better than us.
Flowering information  In Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota, plankton density is decreasing
A recent report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decline in plankton density in some parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, the presence of the sprayed cactus has been reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, suggesting that its density is decreasing.
It stretches for some 130 miles [209 km] along the coastline, from northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
The outbreak is about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but in fewer places than last week.
Flowering has also been observed in Pasco County.
Last week, we had average plankton concentrations in coastal and inland waters in Pinellas County, low to medium in coastal Hillsborough County, natural to high in Manatee County, natural to high in coastal and inland waters in Sarasota County, natural to medium in coastal and inland waters in Charlotte County, natural to high inland and inland waters in Lee County, and low in Collier County.
There are still reports of respiratory irritation in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
But there were no reports of them in northwest Florida last week.
