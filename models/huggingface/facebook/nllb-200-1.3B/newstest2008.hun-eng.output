European inflation slipped on food
The accelerating inflation in the euro area is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
The 13 euro area countries recorded higher than expected price increases in November, with annual inflation of 3.1% after 2.6% in October, the EU's statistical office in Luxembourg reported.
The official forecast was only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the US, UK and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not cut the base rate, saying that the reduction would lead to a spiral of inflation, along with rising commodity prices and easing unemployment.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below 2 percent, but close to that.
One analyst says that the ECB is in the twenty-second trap: "we need to talk down" inflation so that we don't have to act on it later.
In Germany, November inflation was a 12-year record at 3.3%, while in Spain it rose from 3.6% to 4.1.
Eurozone inflation was boosted by soaring food and energy prices.
Wheat futures rose 88 percent, and soybean prices reached their highest level since 1973.
The cost of food and dairy products was also substantially higher in 2007.
The world market price of crude oil has risen 52 percent this year, and last month it was almost $100 a barrel of black gold.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump from 2.1% this year to 2.5% in 2008 and fall to 1.9% in 2009.
Analysts estimate that the 12-month inflation rate will remain around 3% over the next 3-4 months, but the annual average rate will be 2.1%.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to cut interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup sees a government crisis
After a long stagnation, Fidesz's support had grown significantly by early December, so it now has the largest camp since 2002, while Gallup had never before measured such low, 13 percent socialist support.
The difference in the votes of the committed parties, due to the greater determination of the opposition voters, would represent more than two-thirds (71%) support, compared with one-fifth (20%) support for the SME.
The MDF and the SZDSZ are below the parliamentary threshold according to the survey: their support within the total population is two percent.
The number of people who vote for certain parties is one percent higher than the number who support either side.
The economic mood is likely to deteriorate further to the previous low - never before so high, with 41 percent of those who rated the country's economic situation as particularly bad, while another 46 percent said it was quite bad.
After the spring and summer prospects were more optimistic, families are now more pessimistic about the change in their own financial situation.
For the next year, more than half the population expects further deterioration and only a tenth improvement.
In December, more than in any previous Gallup poll, 71 percent of those polled thought the prime minister was doing a bad job than a good job.
In Gyurcsány Ferenc, 13 percent of the respondents trust or very trust him, while in Viktor Orbán, 38 percent of the supporters are.
The Prime Minister is not trusted by 54 percent, the Fidesz president is not trusted by 27 percent.
One indicator of the political situation is how much of the public thinks that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be dealt with without a change of government.
While after the October riots last year, 35 percent thought it desirable to keep the government and the prime minister, this figure is now only 20 percent, while the relative majority (33 percent) see only the possibility of new elections as the solution.
Interest in the referendum is characterized by 60 percent of those who answer the question of participation intent that they would certainly go, and another 20 percent that they would probably go.
By comparison, in a "parliamentary election this Sunday", only 55 percent would be certain to participate and another 15 percent would consider it likely.
74 percent of people would say no to tuition, 79 percent to visitation fees, and 84 percent to hospital bills.
If we look at the same proportions of those who pledged their participation in the referendum alone, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of voters would oppose the introduction of tuition fees, visits and hospital allowances.
The most expensive is Auchan, nearly a fifth higher than Tesco.
The hypermarkets in the Budapest commercial triangle maintained their average price increase of 16 percent last year, with the difference that VAT was not increased this year.
Article in the Daily Economy
This year, the average Christmas basket of Napi in the Budapest shopping triangle increased by 16 percent, but each hypermarket showed an increase of well over 1,000 forints.
Since prices in food stores had already "climbed" in December last year, there was no more drastic increase in prices as a percentage of the previous high base price.
But it is obviously frightening to consumers that what they could get for just under 9,000 forints last year, they will not get for even 10,000 forins now.
The Daily Basket crossed the 10,000 forints psychological limit in the hypermarkets examined with at least 91 forints.
The highest basket value was 10,573.
(In 2003 the basket cost 6800 forints.)
The prices of Unicum and live fish remained almost at last year's level, but so did those of turkey camel filet, nuts and poppy.
KSH tracked the price of flour and bread in the shops, although we found a kilo of bread for 139 forints in Auchan.
The competition did not push the price of the product below 200 forints.
Also surprising in this store was that the price of a two-liter convertible bottle of Coca-Cola was less than 200 forints, so the deposit fee was only 257 for the product.
However, this year Auchan was the most expensive in the Daily basket, while Cora was the cheapest.
We estimate that Cora 15 and Tesco and Auchan have increased their prices in the Daily basket by about 18-18 percent over last year's Christmas prices.
The difference between last year's most expensive and this year's cheapest basket was 12 percent, while the difference between last year's cheapest and this year's most expensive basket was 21 percent.
The average increase in Forint was 1480%.
Last year, the average price increase was 1,206 forints, so last Christmas, the effect of the VAT increase on prices was felt.
This process has disrupted trade, and it is clear that the shops could not decide on the level of the margin to be applied to each product, because they could not calculate the effect of the price change on consumption.
(If the speed of a product is poorly planned by the trader, there may be a serious gain in the traffic-intensity-adjusted margin.)
The VAT caused the price of the Daily Basket to rise so dramatically last year that the most expensive basket was 1720 forints more than in 2006, while the cheapest basket had a price difference of only 844 forints.
This year, the extreme was not shown, as the most expensive was 1630 forints more than last year, and the cheapest was 1284 forints.
The two Christmas seasons were marked by catastrophic price increases, with the price of daily consumer goods in hypermarkets rising by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This does not necessarily confirm the KSH data: the statistical office recorded price increases of more than 30% in 12 months for some basic foodstuffs.
For example, in the case of flour, eggs.)
According to the Daily Basket, this seems almost impossible in the latter case, since the price range of the already quite expensive product last year produced a price increase of barely 10 percent above the base price in the worst case.
Flour suppliers appear to be in a stronger position than egg producers, having managed to outrun the drastic price increase at the multicolored.
In the commercial golden triangle, the hypers don't complain, they keep reporting good years.
In our experience, the majority of customers in the three stores we visited are no longer interested in prices.
They buy quantities of everything, they bring the food to a plateau.
On Wednesday morning, all three stores were in serious queues at the checkout because of a sudden increase in the number of visitors.
But we know that in rural areas, traffic is lower, and many companies complain to research companies that even their plans are falling short of revenue, not just for food but also for durable consumer goods.
In many places, disinfectants are being cut back
This year, more than a thousand infections have been reported in hospitals, mainly due to improper use of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in hospitals, the overcrowding of beds, and the overload of staff are not conducive to stopping infections, says the chief medical officer of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many places, they're saving on disinfectants.
Recently, an MRSA infection was diagnosed in the trauma department of John's Hospital.
A man who was in a serious accident was shown to have bacteria resistant to antibiotics.
The patient has been isolated.
A similar infection occurred here earlier this year.
A serious car accident victim was released from the hospital, but soon afterward he had to return with MRSA infection and an important surgery had not been performed since because of the bacteria in his body.
As of December 10, this year, 1,094 hospital infections caused by multi-drug resistant pathogens were reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said Dr. Karolina Böröcz, chief medical officer of the National Epidemiology Center.
That means that this many infections caused by the M.R.B.s must have been registered in hospitals, the rest is unknown.
Approximately two thirds (683) of the infections were caused by MRSA, or methicillin-oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is carried by one third of the human population through the nose without causing disease.
Infections caused by SA (e. g. strep throat, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infections) respond well to antibiotics and are well curable.
However, if antibiotics are used in excess or inadequately, a bacterium that responds well to antibiotics will develop into a highly antibiotic-resistant bacterium that spreads rapidly in inadequate hospital conditions.
In particular, temporary or permanent immune system dysfunction can cause serious hospital infections such as wound infections or blood poisoning - sepsis - in patients with weakened bodies, the elderly or those with low body weight.
According to the medical director of János Hospital, there is nothing unusual about MRSA infection, such infections are part of the daily practice of hospitals.
Infection should not be confused with plague, MRSA is only present, Rabbit Tibor said, where the presence of the pathogen is not tested.
Resistant to antibiotics
"We isolate such patients, the nursing staff see the patient in rubber gloves and a mask, and there are adequate antibiotics to treat them", said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients admitted to hospital are tested for MRSA, but infection cannot always be avoided.
It's not fashionable to sample
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA are preventable, but the current conditions and conditions in hospitals are not conducive to preventing the development and spread of multi-drug resistant pathogens, says Böröcz Karolina.
Since this infection typically occurs in hospitals, nursing homes, hospitals should monitor incoming patients and isolate MRSA-carrying patients immediately.
However, microbiological sampling is not in vogue in Hungarian hospitals.
The fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance these studies also plays a role.
Most cases are detected when the patient has a detectable MRSA infection, said the chief medical officer of the epidemiological center.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and national guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and pathologies.
The aim is to make antibiotic therapy targeted, i.e. microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always follow this.
Microbiological sampling is even rarer in the commuter and primary care settings, said Karolina Böröcz.
They save on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most commonly transmitted from one patient to another through healthcare personnel.
So, there is a huge role for hand washing, gloves, masks, but there are also significant gaps in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by contact and drip infection, but isolation of an infected patient is not always possible in a home hospital setting.
In fact, hospital rooms are often crowded, often with beds very close together, even though, epidemiologically, patients should be at least five feet apart.
Sadly, Karolina Böröcz noted, hospitals in poor economic conditions are also sparing on disinfectants, with fewer nurses and more patients, making infections even more likely.
According to Karolina Böröcz, where appropriate precautions are taken, fewer such infections can be detected or the spread of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
MRSA infection is a huge cost to health care companies, so they're fighting it everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has included in its programme the prevention and reduction of MRSA.
The programme appears to be successful, with the data reported showing a declining trend in MRSA infections in England.
Prevention of the development of multi-drug resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and of hospital-acquired infections caused by such pathogens is one of the priorities of the European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC).
The police captain who caused the fatal accident was not drunk.
The official expert opinion has been prepared in the case of fatal accident caused by the XXII district police captain.
It is impossible that the drunk or in a coma state would have driven the meanwhile resigned XXII. district police captain, who on Tuesday hit a pedestrian to death, informed Morvai Attila, the spokesman of the Metropolitan Police Department on Friday after the expert opinion on this was prepared.
The expert opinion confirmed the preliminary findings of the investigation, which had already concluded that the former police captain did not drink alcohol before he was behind the wheel.
The then head of the XXII district police station hit a 55-year-old man who was trying to cross the road at the wrong pedestrian crossing on Tuesday while turning his car in the XXII district of Kossuth Lajos Street.
(The latter, i.e. the pedestrian not crossing the zebra, is not an extenuating circumstance under the CRU rules, the driver turning must still give priority.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
The district police chief resigned from his position and asked to be placed on a pension, police said, because the case had so shocked him.
The case is being investigated by the Budapest Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also pointed out that the former police captain cooperated with the prosecutors conducting the investigation from the beginning.
Another EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Three loan framework agreements worth a total of EUR 400 million to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy were signed with Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), in Budapest on Friday.
The European Development Bank (EDB) approved a budgetary framework of EUR 300 million for the Hungarian financing of transport and environmental projects under Cohesion Fund support in 2006, of which 100 million were already under contract, and the contract signed now concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The budgetary financing of education-related projects is also provided by the EUR 150 million loan agreement.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary, with the remaining EUR 150 million to be used later, by extending the loan agreement.
In the field of innovation, the parties signed a contract worth EUR 50 million, which is mainly used for the research and development project of the University of Debrecen.
The meeting also discussed the 4 metro.
It was agreed that when Hungary finalises the details of financing the metro with the EU, it will return to whether and how to amend the original contract.
According to János Veres, this could take place in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed 113 projects in Hungary with a total of EUR 8.4 billion.
The EIB shall provide interest on loans at a rate of EURIBOR, with a grace period of eight years and without a provisioning fee.
Bulgaria is the EU's real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is astonishing - the whole of Europe is focused on the Balkan country, which was mentioned only a little earlier.
What, where and who are buying in the EU's still cheapest but fastest-growing market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most sought-after destination for real estate in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly Bulgaria, with its cheap ski apartments and beach houses.
The hills are the most fashionable in Banszko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa, and along the coast are Albena, the "Golden Coast", the "Sunshine Coast", ancient Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are looking for real estate in the Kavarna and Balchik areas.
Re/Max Bulgaria's analysts believe that sooner or later the central part of the country will also attract investors - Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and that more and more people will also shop in the extremely cheap Rusz area.
The capital, Sofia, also offers attractive opportunities, with commercial and office spaces offering the highest returns.
Bulgaria is well on its way to becoming one of the most attractive European golf destinations, making it a prime destination in the other two seasons as well as in the summer and winter seasons.
Forward-looking investors are therefore already buying in large quantities, for example in the Banszko area.
Analysts say that property buyers in Bulgaria are also looking to change their lives and lifestyles.
Most of the buyers are English, but they come from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present, and the Black Sea and ski resorts traditionally have a large number of Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers can be classified into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
The newcomers either buy renovated properties for between EUR 50 and EUR 100 000, or old houses that have been demolished for EUR 5 to EUR 15 000, and then renovate them.
They need good accessibility and communication facilities, and they are keen to be close to a big city, shops and, in general, the local doctor.
The second category is holidaymakers (Bulgaria was in the top 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group is made up of business investors who buy in the hope of increasing their value in the medium or long term.
The price of capital property is continuing to rise as demand grows.
Although Bulgaria has the lowest property prices in the European Union, it has been growing at a rate of 21 percent a year for the past five years.
The increase in real estate prices is essentially outpacing the increase in salaries.
Fodor and the Hungarian six percent
According to Minister of Environment and Water Affairs Fodor Gábor, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the international climate regime negotiations after 2012 will continue with the ministerial meeting after the official opening on Wednesday.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are discussing the Bali Roadmap, which provides for efforts following the emission reduction period set by the Kyoto Protocol for 2012.
This is a hotly debated issue between developing and developed countries.
The United States has also indicated that it does not wish to negotiate exact figures at this time, although it is inclined to agree to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels.
Another big question at the conference is whether the developed countries will, in addition to reducing emissions, also provide financial and technological assistance to countries that need it.
The Commission has also agreed to provide aid to developing countries.
The grant fund, which is provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be managed by a 16-member board of directors, expected to be within the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), see Market and Profit.
6 percent of Hungary
Minister for Environment and Water Affairs Fodor Gábor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain its flagship role in global climate action and to help create a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU is committed to a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, irrespective of the success of the 'post-2012 agreement', and is ready to commit to a reduction of up to 30% if other large developed regions of the world and developing countries are also willing to make commitments commensurate with their responsibilities and capabilities.
Fodor Gábor pointed out that in 1997 the Kyoto Protocol had set a target of a reduction of 5,2% for all countries, of which the EU, which was then 15 Member States, had committed minus 8%.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to the period 1985-87, which Hungary will meet. - reminds the press release of the Ministry of Environment.
The stakes are high in Bali, where the long-term international climate agreement must be capped within two years, or else its entry into force would be delayed until after 2012, in which case the Kyoto Protocol reduction commitments would not be immediately followed by a new international emission reduction system, the need for which was highlighted by the IPCC, the UN's Nobel Peace Prize-winning international scientific body on climate change, in its latest report.
This would delay the reduction of emissions and make an increase in the average temperature of the earth of over 2 degrees Celsius inevitable, with consequences that scientists say are extremely serious and irreversible.
YouTube is recruiting the British Army
Video footage of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan is being shared on video by British Army units to promote themselves.
The British Air Force (RAF) was the first to get on YouTube: Special Forces in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of their operations against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reported.
These miniature images, taken with a helmeted camera, are checked at the Air Force operations headquarters in Kandahar and then sent to London, where the locals upload them to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
139 videos of the Air Force soldiers have been uploaded to the Internet in this form, and their "channel" has been viewed by over 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered as Defenceheadquarters in the spring of 2007 and publishes videos of both the Iraq and Afghanistan operations, while the British Commonwealth Office and the International Peace Keeping Forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own YouTube channels.
Operation in Afghanistan
The Air Force originally intended the videos to be for recruitment purposes, and the Department of Defense says it's also good for educating the public about the true purpose of the military's foreign presence.
Propaganda in this form costs little compared with traditional television advertising, defense expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC, but it inevitably carries a political message, as it provides a specific form of justification for military action by the government.
The Americans were making a game
The army also has a problem with carefully edited, censored footage and amateur videos that are shared, such as those showing soldiers dying: in the slightly hypocritical "official" propaganda films, the officers talk about casualties at the most, but do not show the bloody side of the battle.
There are, by the way, a number of videos of the battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan that have been leaked online, and they're taken in the context of intense combat, but the British military has only recently been able to access them.
The Americans are recruiting a little differently with the free-to-download shooter game America's Army, in which the player can go directly into the shoes of soldiers in a more or less lifelike simulation.
It's going to be a Christmas of riots and baggage-handling at the ministries.
Mr Lamperth Mónika, Minister for Labour, does not seem to be emotional: instead of a Christmas party, he will be holding a year-end workshop for his colleagues, who have been thanking him for baggage and coffee since 2007.
Some ministries have live music parties, others have carnivals and carnivals to bring the Christmas spirit to the hearts of the officials.
Party, Christmas spirit, concerts and a dinner table - that's how power is entertained.
The government agencies are preparing for Christmas.
The largest departmental Christmas party this year is being held by the Department of Homeland Security, but HM is not expecting departmental employees.
On the Christmas of the Orphans, children of fallen soldiers receive gifts, on the Mission Christmas, the families of soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are hosted, but there is also a press reception.
The wallet's got $25 million for the year-end mood.
The National Development Agency (NDA) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) are pushing you out of your pocket compared to the rest of the wallet.
The GKM party is held in the House of the Future, for a total of 4,320,000 forints, and about three hundred and fifty guests are expected from the six hundred ministerial employees.
At the wallet party, they'll stick to the Christmas spirit, but there will be performers and a raffle.
The NFU Christmas party cost HUF 4,700,000 and was held in the building of the National Council for the Judiciary (OIT) on Wednesday - with concerts and dinner.
The rent of the hall cost one million forints, the remaining part was spent on the more than four hundred guests.
We know that one of the NFÜ's classes is also scheduled for another Christmas celebration: this is organised by a bidding company, the Hungarian Economic Development Centre, with EU funds.
The building of the Vygotsky Theatre was rented for the purpose.
The information was not confirmed at MAG Zrt. because we could not reach the person.
No need for a suit
The ILO building hosted not only the NFU but also the Ministry of Justice and Law Enforcement, which hosted a Lucca Day ball on 7 December instead of Christmas.
He didn't ask them for money to use the ILO's premises.
The ball was attended by five hundred people.
The party began with the minister's welcome, and after dinner, there was dancing to live music.
The [origo] question was answered that there was no requirement at all for evening dress or costume at the ball.
The Health, Labor and Welfare departments are having a Puritan party.
The Ministry of Health is organizing a show and celebration for the employees in its own building for 400,000 forints.
But Minister Lamperth Monica of Labour is officially not expecting a Christmas party, but a year-end job fair.
They expect 180 guests, who, the press department said, will only receive coffee and bagel, so the party will be brought out of 350,000 forints.
But Minister Gordon of Municipalities in Baja will simply be hanging out with his colleagues in the Ministry of Municipalities and Regional Development's auditorium.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) is holding a Christmas gathering in its own hall, with 436 employees waiting.
They're spending 2,500 for each guest at the Christmas party - that's enough money for a dinner party and a car wash.
Since János Veres became minister, every year the PM employees celebrate Christmas in the same way.
But there will be no party atmosphere, the formality will be strengthened not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon schedule.
The Agriculture Department is giving a New Year's party on January 20th, and the Ministry's Christmas is missing.
The bet is held at the Vajdahunyadvár, the Town Hall, and according to the wallet, the 100 guests will receive 1000 forints each.
This will be a very simple standing bet, which only foreign diplomats accredited to Hungary are allowed to play.
These annual banquets begin with a short ministerial greeting and end with a restrained banquet.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not hold any Christmas parties at all, the relevant press departments told [origo].
The price of the environmental portfolio office Christmas was not disclosed in the press department.
Over four hundred people were invited to the party at the Museum of Industrial Artists.
The forces of the giant strike are gathering
On Friday, the National Federation of Trade Unions and the National Federation of Workers' Councils will form their strike committee to coordinate the Monday strike.
A protest rally is scheduled for Saturday, and the strike begins on Monday, the day of the final vote on the health insurance law.
The action will certainly cause significant disruption to transport, as rail traffic will almost completely stop, and they will strike at the BKV for 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the League of Trade Unions will announce the details of its Monday strike, which is being organized jointly with the National Federation of Workers' Councils.
A strike committee will be formed to coordinate Monday's actions.
On Saturday, they hold a protest rally, and on Monday, the organizations that join the strike will suspend their work indefinitely if they cannot reach an agreement with the government.
This means that no date was set for the end of the strike, which began on the day of the parliamentary vote on the health insurance law.
If the National Assembly does not pass the health insurance law, the unions will immediately withdraw the strike call.
If the bill is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide whether to continue.
According to the agenda of the Parliament on Monday, it is also conceivable that the health insurance law will be voted on only in the late evening, possibly at night.
The strike, which begins on Monday, will cause major disruptions to transport: work on the railway will be halted indefinitely, part of Budapest's public transport may stop in the morning, and more than half of Volán's companies will be shut down.
At the same time, there will be a half-way road closure in many parts of the country.
The strike call was joined by a number of trade unions and civil society organisations, whose lists are updated on the League's home page.
Some organizations announced an indefinite strike, others a temporary stoppage of work.
As of Thursday afternoon, the MÁV and the Railway Workers' Free Trade Union (RFLT) could not even agree on sufficient service, even though more and more people are traveling by rail as the Christmas holidays approach.
According to reports, they will strike at the BKV from the start until 13 hours, at the Budapest Airport between 7 and 9 in the morning, they will strike for four hours by the LIGA Electricity and Heat Energy Industry Trade Unions, 2 and 2-8 hours by the Pedagogues' Trade Union and the Pedagogues' Democratic Trade Union.
The Hungarian Medical Association is striking nationwide, at different times, while the Democratic Trade Union of Health and Social Workers (EDDSZ), which belongs to the SZEF, is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The four demands made by the League are the most important: the government should withdraw its proposal for health insurance reform and allow a new concept for social debate.
The second requirement is that a new pension calculation system should be introduced gradually from next year.
The third is to ensure that the old-age pension is available for qualifying periods before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (FRUW) of the League of Trade Unions does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economy and Transport for the railway sidings and is waiting for another offer.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard has raised the risk of the country
The activities of the Hungarian Guard, which was founded in August this year with the support of the Jobbik Movement for Hungary, have also raised the political risk of Hungary and the region in several respects, according to the Risk Analysing Division of Political Capital.
The company's "risk warning" stated that the greatest political risk in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard is that "the ethnic tension between the Roma and non-Gypsy population in Hungary, which already exists, could lead to violent ethnic clashes in the short term".
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is probably aimed at provoking such an act - the research institute added.
As they wrote, this can be traced back to one of the most important failures of Hungarian politicians: "public debate on the Roma issue was allowed by public actors to representatives of radical and extremist political groups who could build a political strategy against the Gypsy-Hungarian opposition".
This deepens the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists, and increases the likelihood of violent conflict, they believe.
In addition, the research institute said that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, due to the large domestic and international media attention, "significantly eroded the image of Hungary abroad, especially in terms of the country's stability and democratic development".
It is recalled that as part of the reorganization of the radical and far-right groups in Hungary, which has gained increasing publicity and momentum since the autumn of 2006, several organizations calling themselves "national self-defense" associations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007.
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as a civilian organization, while openly promoting the preparation of their members - even armed - for defensive (catastrophe, homeland defense, law enforcement) tasks, and also citing the incompetence of the police, the army, i.e. the state", they added.
They noted that this was done in accordance with the method of putting different political aspirations into civilian clothing, based on the political and non-partisan nature of society.
The emphasis on civility and the form of association is therefore not only a means of avoiding legal obstacles to the registration of such associations, but also a political strategy.
The analysis shows that the activities of the Hungarian Guard are a risk-increasing factor also in terms of neighbourly relations.
"In recent months, several neighboring states have also referred to the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of danger, and some ultra-nationalist political actors in neighboring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this affects the political stability of the region", they added.
According to the research institute, the formation of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Eastern-Central Europe, so political risks have increased for the whole region.
As reported, the Hungarian Guard operates similarly to the Bulgarian National Guard, which was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
The background to the formation of the Bulgarian Guard is the mass Roma riots that broke out in a district of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana).
The BNU took advantage of this and decided to establish the Guards, saying that the purpose of the organization was "national self-defense".
They say that "gypsy terror" has been going on in Bulgaria for the past 17 years, but the state has remained passive and indifferent, recalls Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had caused a heated debate in the Bulgarian public.
As reported, the increased risk of ethnic clashes is indicated by the fact that some Romani organizations in Bulgaria have announced that they will create their own guards as a resistance.
Since the Hungarian Guard's previous operations have similarities to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be ruled out that the Roma in Hungary will respond to the threat in a similar way, by organizing their own self-defense - according to the risk warning of Political Capital.
Juhász Attila, research director at Political Capital, told the telegraph office that risk analysis is one of the research institute's activities.
As he said, they publish their risk analysis every year, and if they find something that could affect the change in risk, they inform the public, as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
Not everywhere is a red letter
In Hungary, the law accurately marks the days in red, and around the holidays it has become common practice to rearrange the working day, which will be less next year.
The holiday is not uniform in the EU and the US.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between national and state holidays and public holidays.
The holidays are usually associated with religious holidays and historical events.
We also celebrate New Year's Day, the last day of the previous year and the first day of the new year, both days of rest - the latter just so that the New Year's celebrants can relax.
We have eleven red letter holidays all year.
National holidays are March 15 commemorating the 1848 revolution and October 23, also commemorating the 1956 revolution.
On August 20 we celebrate the founding of the state, on May 1 we celebrate the work, and on November 1 and 2 we remember our deceased relatives and friends.
We also have two days of celebration, Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our national, state, or even religious holidays rarely fall on weekends, it became common to schedule a workday in cases where we worked only one day before or after the red-letter holiday.
True, the price of an extended weekend is not to miss work-school on the Saturday before.
The Minister of Labour has for many years laid down a special decree on the exact time of the day immediately preceding or following the holiday.
The legislation applies to all employers and to the workers employed by them, to civil servants and to those in a legal relationship with the public service.
However, it shall not affect undertakings or institutions which operate without interruption and which, by reason of their purpose, also operate on public holidays.
This year, the work schedule changes only around the end of the year holidays: from December 24, life in the country almost stops, as experience shows that the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve are "slipped" or used for this purpose by most people.
Next year, we'll have more holidays in the middle and at the end of the week, so we'll have less workdays than this year.
First, the calendar changes around Labor Day, and then the workers stay home for four consecutive days.
Saturday, April 26, will be a working day, in exchange for Friday, May 2, being a day of rest.
The second shift is due to the celebration of October 23rd, when the work will be on Saturday, October 18th instead of Friday, October 24th.
The end of the year, however, can be a definite holiday next year, as from December 24 almost everywhere a nonstop holiday is observed, even if New Year's Day falls on Wednesday.
Six Little Things That Can Discourage Your Coworkers
E-mails we forget to send, voice mail we never get, innocent lies we hardly notice, these are the things that color our daily routine at work.
It's a matter of getting used to the little inconveniences or putting on the gloves and knowingly avoiding the misunderstood, annoying situations.
I guess.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you that you were looking for the marketing department", says one of your colleagues.
That's why you missed a meeting?
In the best case scenario, you're sorry and you're trying to make amends, maybe you're calling the marketing department to tell them you forgot to deliver the message (this is the less common solution).
Most of the time, it's settled by an apology.
Before embarrassing excuses are made, it is worthwhile to consider what might cause your colleagues to feel uncomfortable, and you should consciously try to avoid doing so.
Borrowing something that's not yours?
There's nothing more annoying than reaching for a file or office supplies or your phone and it's nowhere to be found.
Remember yesterday you put your fire engine on the table, and then it was up in the morning?
Do you find your pen on the desk of a colleague who thought it was lost?
Do not take anything from your coworkers without asking, for they will rightly be angry with you for taking their property.
Don't put it in your pocket from your office envelopes or postcards, because it might be uncomfortable if it runs out before its time, and you'd need it right away.
You gossip about the privacy of your coworkers?
There's no good way to stop the rumor that's already spreading.
Who, who, what did he do?
Where and why?
Do not spread your information (assumptions) about the private life of your colleagues.
If one of them shares his innermost secrets with you, do not betray his trust.
Bury what you hear in your heart, and do not discuss it with your coworkers in your absence, even if others know about what your colleague wore.
You're reporting sick for no reason?
When you call the office and you report a headache because you feel sick or you feel that you should rest for the day, remember that your work, your urgent tasks, your deadlines, must be done by someone else.
Don't fuck with your colleagues.
If you know in advance that you will not be in the office the next day or that something may happen that will require you to stay home, let your colleagues and your boss know so that they will not miss you the next day.
Whispering, whining, calling
You're deep in your work, but you're getting a little bit of a laugh out of it?
You accidentally overheard a phone call you shouldn't have heard?
Do not disturb your coworkers with whining, singing, loud conversation (which you carry on above their heads), or kicking, constant abuse, loud complaints.
All of these can be confusing, even if they are not deeply involved in a project (writing, planning, organizing).
You blame others for your mistakes?
If you're late for something, you forgot to send an important letter, a message, don't blame someone else for your forgetfulness.
Don't point to the chaos in the office, the loud-mouthed colleagues.
Admit when you've made a mistake that has hurt someone else and get out of the way.
Ask her how you can make up for your mistake, make up for your failure.
Are you too comfortable in the office?
Pants and slippers: comfortable to wear at home, but not at the office.
Don't wear comfortable clothes if your job allows it.
Don't be rude to your colleagues, and honor yourself by going into the office in plain clothes - if your job requires it, neatly, elegantly -
If you want to meet, you're not interesting anymore.
Driving through the usual morning traffic jam.
The radio sounds a special melody: a violin sound with electronic effects.
I'm gonna turn the volume up a little bit.
The music changes pace and the bass comes along with the previous tones, and then a jewel in the crown is a female choir.
Zagar's song is called Wings of Love on mr2.
The music life in our country has not been pleasant for a long time with high-quality electronic pop.
But now it seems like the traffic is different when you're listening to the new Zagar record.
The emergence of Yonderboy, some new and exciting productions from the local digital underground, is slowly changing the picture, and while guitar-driven garage rock is once again in fashion, local electropop is proving that there is something new under the sun.
Zságer Balazs started out in Pécs, and he played in the Yonderboi band, until - perhaps because two dudes didn't get in a barbecue - he went his own way.
With his project (Zagar) and music that combines elements of jazz, electronic dance music, pop, however, he began to break through when film soundtracks were requested for composition (e.g.
The Turkish name is Ferenc Sezon.
The band, which originally played in smaller clubs, was introduced to a wider audience when the magazine wan2 ranked their first album in 2002 among the fifty most important domestic albums and declared Zagar, with Yonderboi, as the only trendsetter in the country that seems marketable in the West.
No doubt, Zagar and his band became "trendy", but of course no one asked them if they wanted to wear the label.
The band responded in the right way, making a new, better record.
Their new album Cannot Walk Fly Instead may open up new avenues for them, although the title itself is intended to create continuity with their early years in Pech.
This was one of the lines of Zságer Balaázs' old band there.
The airy, flying reference would have been fine, but along with the airiness of the music, there was now, in keeping with the spirit of the age, the trend, the influence of the louder guitar, the rock and roll.
In these songs, the singer György Ligeti, who is currently working in England with the band The Puzzle, appeared at the premiere of the album in Millenáris.
The album also produced a real radio hit, with Mr2 Petőfi, who recently played popular music from morning to night, beginning to smuggle into the ears the generous songs Wings of Love recorded with six local singers ("Underground Divas").
So everything is fine.
The newspaper asked Balazs.
hvg.hu: With this new hit, the question now is: how much of the music you're playing is left?
Zsager Balazs: The definition of layering doesn't mean much to me.
I think there are two kinds of light music, not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
So-called alternative, underground music can be flat, unintelligible, and just as it is purely for sale, making it commercial.
But a good butt can come from a sincere motivation.
Your welcoming attitude works in this spirit, regardless of language and borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences to music?
ZB: Abroad, especially in the West, there are more traditions of light music.
Not only do the ten- and twenty-year-olds attend concerts there, but the older ones too.
They are much more aware of the changes in light music that are taking place around them, because they consider it to be part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many people listen to your music?
ZB: Of course, it's good to see more people coming to our shows.
But we never released music.
We don't make music for a purpose, we make music for a reason.
The audience's role is more pronounced at concerts where the interaction is already in place, but it's only in the subtle changes of the moment.
Still, I've noticed that if you're trying to satisfy the audience, you're not interesting anymore.
hvg.hu: How far do you plan to follow Yonderboi's example?
He's a soloist, and he's built his career more west of us.
ZB: We don't really follow his path, even though they sometimes try to explain it in our music.
We're more like team players who trust each other's musical presence and let it unfold.
At first, of course, it was inevitable that our work would be compared to the music of Yonderboy, as many of us would leave his band and go on to other paths.
On the mr2 Petőfi top list, Wings of Love is number one.
Many people first heard the name Zagar in this song.
Did you consciously open up the more popular style to a wider audience?
ZB: We didn't have a plan to write a hit song and sell it.
This song is about more than that.
We wanted it to be the end of the album, trying to break up the overtones and the more difficult themes that were on the record.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why them - what was the guideline?
ZS: The idea was to have a gospel-like choir.
And that's when I got the idea to put this choir together from the good-sounding soloists of our home music scene.
Thus came together the six-member choir - Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Péterfy Bori, Hodosi Enikő [Neo], Németh Juci - which we later named Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Is this how you planned the song or did the girls adapt it?
ZB: The song had been around for a long time in an instrumental version, and then when the record came together, we thought we needed something more for this song.
The chord pattern attracted him to my lyrics.
That night I sang the melody that the girls later learned.
It was almost a first, and it was scary spontaneous.
I remember it was very exciting back then, but of course it had to be the Divas.
It wouldn't have worked so powerfully with my voice.
hvg.hu: Both on the album and at the concert, it seemed like the girls were in the background.
They have no solos (except for Judy Jay's short solo), they have no parts of their own, they sing completely together and they are no louder than the music, so the music doesn't just accompany their singing.
They were backstage.
Is that intentional?
ZB: The fact that they were standing in the back was purely a technical problem.
But we didn't want to share solo roles.
The song is about forgetting our egos for a while, about who we are, where we're going, and just letting those certain wings, the wings of love, lift us up.
I wanted others to feel the euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which one did you work with the most?
ZB: In the process of creating music, there were actually more difficult pieces than mixing.
Like Dorian Gray's Dilemma, where I play a racing piano, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where the groove didn't work for a long time, and then it all kind of came together, like a game of craps.
hvg.hu: What's your favorite song from the new album?
ZB: It's always changing with the gigs and the fact that I've already "discharged" the record.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The rogue broker risked billions of dollars to get his feelings of inferiority
He's a cold-blooded snitch.
The owner of the Czech Commercial Bank, the banker of the French Société Générale, calls his former employee Jerome Kerviel.
Kerviel has cost him almost five billion euros.
However, it seems that Kerviel, who was not at all untalented, was more of a big player who wanted to catch up with his colleagues.
Unlike other banks, he recognized the crisis in the U.S. mortgage market early.
"Limited mental capacity", said his superiors, who alerted the police.
However, as reported by Le Monde in France, Kerviel's statement shows that he made a profit of EUR 1,6 billion from his business at the end of last year.
The crisis is not just in America
"I was just trying to make money for my bank", he says in his confession.
In the summer of the American crisis, he managed to earn half a billion euros.
He felt the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, there were reports of problems with so-called subprime mortgages given to low-income or past customers with troubled repayment.
However, this crisis should not have a negative impact on the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe that and he was a good horse.
Its profit at year-end was EUR 1.6 billion.
"Even when I made my first half a billion dollars, I didn't know how to report it", Kerviel admits, adding that he had nothing left for himself.
In his confession, he admits to falsifying his reports in a way that could not be revealed.
He managed to outsmart his bosses, even when the Eurex stock exchange was starting to take an interest in his trades.
The risk was the gain
You were afraid it would come out?
I'd rather not.
"I thought the fact that I made $1.6 billion for the bank would reassure them".
How did you have the will to risk that?
He gradually gained his position.
After graduating from the University of Lyon, he worked at Société Générale Bank since 2000.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
Two years later, he was an assistant broker, and he became a freelance broker in 2005 with a salary of $90,000 a year.
Yet he knew he would never make as much as others.
"I knew from my first conversation in 2005 that I was being looked down upon.
"I'm not going to be able to do this because of my education, my professional development and my personal development", Kerviel told investigators.
Soon after he joined, his first big success came.
He was making money on Allianz shares, because he bet half a billion euros on the fall of those shares during the London bombings.
And that started an avalanche - he wanted more.
While you're looking, we'll leave you alone.
"It's like a snowball", he told the police.
But his bosses supposedly knew everything, or rather, they suspected.
"While I was making money, they turned a blind eye".
But there was a blow earlier this year.
He lost a billion euros in one day.
One weekend in mid-January, he wanted to sneak out.
When he started work on Monday, he was no longer working at the bank.
And the bank announced a few days later that it had lost five billion euros.
And how did they find out?
His freedom has made him a suspect.
"I've only taken four days off in the past year.
A broker who has no freedom is a broker who does not want anyone to look at his reports", Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has a chance to get 365 billion
The Czech government ministers and the European Commission have signed a total of nine operational programmes, from which the Czech Republic could receive EUR 14 billion (approximately SEK 365 billion) over the coming years.
This represents approximately half of the total amount that the Czech Republic could obtain from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
The regions will benefit from seven operational programmes worth approximately SEK 125 billion.
Czech companies will be able to receive around 100 billion crowns from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money, 150 billion, goes to transport.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and accounts for 22% of the funds available for the Czech Republic.
The funds will increase the State Fund for Transport Infrastructure, which will be managed next year at CZK 90,8 billion.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme helps entrepreneurs and companies to acquire assets for innovative enterprises.
Companies should also have resources to introduce new technologies, industrial research, but also to introduce more efficient organizational methods.
The Czech Republic is among the least successful newcomers to EU funds.
Former Nicaraguan president sentenced to 20 years in prison
Nicaragua's Court of Appeals on Thursday upheld a 20-year prison sentence for Arnold Alemán, the country's former president, who was convicted in 2003 of financial fraud totaling $100 million.
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest at his hacienda near the capital.
Whether the former leader of the Central American country, who served from 1997 to 2002, will return to prison remains unclear, according to the Associated Press.
The President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Perez, said it would be up to the prison administration whether Alemán would be allowed to serve his sentence at home or return to prison.
A court four years ago found Alemán to have routinely transferred government funds to foreign companies' accounts in Panama.
These fictitious companies and their account numbers were in reality those of their relatives and closest supporters.
Some of this money was then spent on a foundation that Alemán set up to finance his 2001 election campaign.
They approved our budget.
That's right.
They've approved the state budget.
What makes this budget special?
This is the first budget prepared by this government, adopted by a coalition majority, without opposition support.
This year, last year, it was supported by the Social Democrats, since Minister Sobotka and the Czech Social Democratic Party could not afford to reject it.
Unlike the pre-voting debate over the government's distrust, there was no drama this time.
The House passed this generally ignored, though most influential, bill.
There's a certain contradiction in that.
Every governance starts and ends with a chapter and a paragraph of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential element of politics, but it's hidden behind the power struggles between the government and the opposition.
It's more appreciated in the press, so it gets a lot more media attention.
The debates of politicians are more interesting to the public than mere numbers.
The state budgets of the previous Social Democratic governments have suffered from three shortcomings which the 2008 budget cannot solve simultaneously:
The first is the high proportion of the mandatory so-called contract spending law, which means not only pensions but also social benefits, which were approved by the quiet "coalition" of the ČSSD and KSČM before the elections last year.
The second is the consequence of the first deficiency, the deficit management.
The third constraint is the deficit in public financing, i.e. the deficit in the budgets of the cities and districts.
However, the biggest risk is not the deficit in the state budget.
It's public and relatively controlled.
Timed bombs are the deficits of the budget of cities and counties.
Many mayors could raise money for other investments besides taxes, fees, and bank loans, often issuing bonds that disproportionately indebted their town halls.
In recent years, these debts have been paid by the mass sale of shares in the energy and other distribution networks, which the State received from privatisations.
They don't have that right now.
Based on official and verifiable facts only, we conclude that:
Our economy, like the rest of the world, has been going through a growth phase for several years now, which the Czech Social Democratic Party has been constantly boasting about.
This was a unique opportunity for his government to regulate public financing.
Instead, the country was driven deeper into debt.
The other countries, with one or two exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, were far more rational than the Czech Republic.
This is a huge disgrace, especially for the previous governments.
We are among the countries that are least threatened by poverty on a global scale.
This is why we do not need huge social programmes, which have unfortunately become gigantic in recent years, and which are completely unnecessary.
Although we have succeeded in eliminating some of the senseless populist spending approved before the elections this year, even if we do not have a delay in the retirement age and pension reform in the near future, then in this country, it will be the end of all politics and whoever governs it, it will be just bureaucracy.
It is a bit of an exaggeration to say that the majority of the tax money from the governing politicians is usually turned into mechanical distributions of pensions and social benefits.
This year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but can only stop the displacement of normal expenditure by mandated expenditure.
The projected deficit of 70 billion by 2008 would be completely unnecessary if the previous governments had not spent everything they could over the last decade.
If we do not want to see the government become a mere bureaucracy, we must be patient and give time to this not very strong coalition government, which is aware that the state can only spend as much as it can with taxes and levies, to prepare further reforms.
Only these will allow a balanced budget to be achieved gradually.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, the European Central Bank, and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland, and Canada have decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
It costs the financial markets over a hundred billion dollars through the stock exchanges.
On this exchange, the banks raise the interest rates at which they are willing to lend money.
For example, the U.S. Federal Reserve is issuing 40 billion dollars to the stock market, and another 24 billion dollars are available to the European and Swiss central banks.
For the first time since the September 11 attacks, the central banks of each country have agreed on a coordinated process to prevent or mitigate the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This move should address the economy's biggest problems, namely the growing shortage of free capital that banks could lend", Bernard Baumohl of the consultancy Economic Outlook Group wrote in a report to his clients.
"Coordinated action by central banks has reduced the probability of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to about 50 percent", Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost 60 billion dollars, primarily in the United States, on unpaid loans.
Analysts are expecting another billion dollars in losses.
"Central banks can really be wary of what might happen if they decide to do this", said Kieran Davies, chief economist at ABN Amro.
It seems that the situation is really bad", he added.
Central banks are afraid that if they themselves have difficulty accessing loans, they will lend more expensive loans to their customers.
That would reduce demand and push the U.S. economy into recession with potential consequences for global economic growth.
The central banks made this decision after failing to reduce the LIBOR, the London interbank offered rate, which is used to borrow money on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were constantly afraid to lend money to each other, even though the central banks of the US, Canada and the UK had also cut interest rates several times during the autumn.
"It will have the same effect as further interest rate cuts", Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the central banks' actions will help avert the crisis, since they will not solve the underlying problem of the collapse of the U.S. housing market.
Klaus: The incredible debates of ecologists
Global climate change is the biggest threat to developing countries.
President Vaclav Klaus has once again expressed his opinion on the problem of global warming.
This time, he criticized the UN's international conference on climate change in Bali.
His book, Blue, Not the Green Planet, presented in Vienna, made the case that the debates among ecologists are incredible.
Klaus believes that not only is the conference's structure unacceptable, which is a peculiar mix of representatives of governments and NGOs, but also the fundamental difference between the accompanying rhetoric and reality.
"The debate there is absolutely without structure, it's just throwing words at the solution to the current problems", Klaus said.
During the presentation of his book, the Czech president stressed that his subject matter was very important to him, and that is why he was so committed to it.
He expressed satisfaction that the book would be published in German, since, as he said, "I often encounter only caricatures of my own opinions".
Now, those interested can read his non-distorted opinion.
Klaus reminded that although he is not a climate scientist, he believes he has sufficient background to write such a book.
Because he can monitor and judge professional papers, he has experience as an academic in statistics and an economist.
The book concludes by stating that climate change is constant, that is, it is normal, and that not all scientists agree that the consequences of current changes are too great and serious to pose a threat, and that efforts to influence climate change are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptably costly.
Moreover, as a person with experience in the field of totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he perceives as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
He repeatedly explained to those present that he was "not against reasonable environmental protection, but against militant environmentalism which does not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits".
Klaus spoke about a similar topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 failed to change their license
600,000 drivers missed the deadline and were unable to replace their old license, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day to file for a transfer so the authorities can issue a new license in time for the end of the year.
The ministry, however, is not afraid that after the New Year, a hundred thousand drivers will start driving without a valid license.
According to the authorities, the license was not replaced primarily by those who no longer want to drive.
While the trips represent a sharp drop in interest in license exchanges, the Metropolitan Office has been flooded with requests for license exchanges, which have seen a surge of interest this week.
The Mayor's Office receives about 2000 clients a day.
You'll have to stand in line for about half an hour.
In Prague, approximately 140,000 drivers have not yet changed their licence.
It takes 20 days to issue a new licence.
However, a new licence may be applied for within a shorter period of five days.
In such a case, however, the driver must pay an additional five hundred kroner.
Drivers who fail to make the mandatory license change by the end of the year and start with an invalid license will face penalties from January.
The guilty party must pay a maximum of 2,000 crowns.
However, the police may arrange the violation by agreement.
The penalty for administrative violation is 2500 crowns.
Based on the information I've received from City Hall, you can get a fine for not traveling anywhere.
They say he can pay up to 30,000.
The Ministry has previously called on the authorities to be lenient and to impose fines of up to 1,000 kroner.
However, according to the Ministry of Transport spokesman Karel Hanzelka, tens of thousands of fines are not a threat to anyone.
He thinks a driver's license is a document that people can decide whether they want it or not.
This is not an ID card that should be valid for everyone.
Those who don't want to drive anymore should cancel their license.
Just take it or it is recommended to send it by post to the appropriate office.
Licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will be invalid at the end of the year.
However, drivers must also gradually change the type of other licences.
Those with documents from 1994 to 2000 can replace them for another three years.
Licences issued between 2001 and 2004 shall expire only in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million additional documents.
The court reduced the sentences of the investigators who conspired with Berdyc.
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are suspected of conspiring with David Berdych's criminal group, were sentenced to 13 and 10 years in prison.
This was decided by the Prague Supreme Court, which reduced the sentences of one and the other by two years.
The investigators of the organized crime subdivision in Prague were originally threatened with 14 and 12 years in prison.
Today's decision is not subject to appeal, and review can only be sought in the Supreme Court.
Although Berdych is also a suspect in this case, he is only awaiting a first-degree conviction.
In other cases, he has been sentenced to a total of more than 16 years.
That's all you get.
The county court in January found 19 people primarily guilty of participating in robbery attacks, of which the Supreme Court heard 16 appeals today.
The majority of the defendants have rejected the charges since the beginning of the investigation, arguing that it is a speculative case.
According to the Central Czech Senate, police members after the Berdych deal provided the criminals with information from police sources, covered up individual robberies and helped the gang avoid prosecution.
The gang gave 30 percent of the robbery to Opava and Koňařík.
The indictment concerns the gang's crimes between 1999 and 2001.
The main cases are robberies, the victims of which have often suffered serious health damage, but also the abuse of official authority and the illegal possession of weapons.
Because police have found illegal handguns, steel-core bullets, laser-controlled weapons or machine guns during house searches.
The gang allegedly plundered tens of millions of crowns in the course of the robberies.
The gang of less than 20 members has been found guilty by the courts in this case of Berdych's other robberies and many others.
Other members of Berdych's entourage are testifying in other court proceedings, some cases not yet before the court.
The trial at first instance has so far avoided Tomáš Put and Maroš Šulej, who are in pre-trial detention in Ireland awaiting a final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic for criminal proceedings.
Bill for the child exchange: 12 million
For the children who were exchanged at the maternity ward, the lawyer of the injured families, Igor Veleba, demands from the hospital in Třebíč 12 million crowns in pain compensation plus court costs.
Three million a head for mothers, two million for fathers, and one million for children.
The hospital offers up to 200,000 per parent.
The hospital's legal representative, Ondřej Dostál Veleba, does not agree with the proposal in principle.
"We refuse such a demand because it is too much", Dostal said after today's hearing.
"To form an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need an expert opinion drawn up by the opponent.
We're gonna determine if there's any value in it at all.
But we maintain that this will be measured in hundreds of thousands for everyone", said Dostál.
He thinks the amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 cents for the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jablonowski family wanted one million crowns for every month she raised her own biological daughter.
Veleba used an expert opinion, prepared by the Motol University Hospital in Prague, as the basis for the compensation negotiations.
Psychologists and psychiatrists say that the children's parents suffered varying degrees and depths of emotional damage and stress.
Men were better able to cope with stress, even when they were faced with such a level of contempt that it did not prevent their newborn from switching.
Women are having a harder time dealing with the actuality of the trauma they've experienced and what's happening right now, Veleba summed up the content.
Veronica and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the Třebíč maternity ward on December 9.
Last week the children returned to their birth parents - Nikola Čermákov in Přibyslavice, Veronika Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jablonec.
At the end of October, the head of the district of Vysočina, Miloš Vystrčil, handed over 100,000 kronor to the families to cover their expenses, which were caused by the error of the hospital in Třebíčské, which is run by the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured against damage.
In the event of an error, they shall contact the reserve fund and, in exceptional cases, the founder.
Courts have so far granted relatively low compensation to people, the amounts being calculated on the basis of tables of a few hundred thousand, in exceptional cases several million kroner.
Polívka lost her kingdom of Valašsko
Bolek Polívka lost a lawsuit for the title of the Kingdom of Valašsko.
According to the judge of the Ostrava District Court, although he first used the name of King Valachi, the project was developed by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, who worked with the actor for many years.
Polívka did not attend the hearing today.
However, according to his lawyer, the case is unlikely to end and the client will appeal.
"The argument is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasitic on the popularity of Bolek Polívka", said Polívka's lawyer after the trial.
He says that when you hear the words Valachi Kingdom, you think of the comedian.
This opinion is shared by Harabis.
"We've got almost ten years of work behind us.
"Finding money and inventing action", he said.
He thinks the reason for the fight is money.
"After years, they realized that the project was a success and that they could gain something from it.
They want to parasitize our work", he added.
Profitable business
According to the court, the name "King Valachi" was first used by Polívka in a television show.
In 1993 he was crowned by Radoslav Brzobohatý.
At the time, however, this was not related to the goal of building a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabis came up with the idea of issuing valachi passports.
The original student-run stock exchange turned into a business and a profitable entrepreneurial activity, upon which Harabiš then founded the society of the Kingdom of Valašsko.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to put his name and signature on passports, even offering their owners discounts on visits to his farm and theatrical performances.
Who's taking the throne?
The judge also mentioned today that Harabiš himself only used the idea that Polívka made public in the appeal to undertake.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka has certainly helped the Valachi Kingdom project", the judge said.
However, he added that the spirit of the project was Harabis and his team, who were working hard on it.
The cooperation between the now-confused parties continued until 2000, when Harabiš organized an official coronation of Polivka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, disputes have been mounting between Polivka and Harabiš, culminating in the acquittal of "the forever-elected King Boleslav I".
The leading role in the kingdom was taken over by Jarmila Šulakova as Queen Mother on Harabiš's initiative.
In 2002, Polívka filed a lawsuit against Harabiš and his associates, which was rejected today.
The battle planned by Harabis for the throne and half of the princess could shed light on the controversy.
This battle should make a new king.
He didn't want to give us the details or the date.
"We don't want to take anything.
This should be something like the Slovak King's Rescue.
The king should be elected for a fixed term.
Mr. Polivka can also apply", Harabiš added.
The Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi test: disappearing biases
To be honest, I never liked the Peugeot 206.
Menet's qualities are not unusual, and the quality of the gear, the handling and the production are often described as below average.
But the successor on the market, the Peugeot 207, is substantially better.
And the van called SW goes one degree further, so I'm left with nothing but to think.
When I was testing the Peugeot 207 classic hatchback, I complained about the back seat and the head space.
This time, the complaint is over, for the body of the van means that the seven-foot-tall giants no longer suffer in this respect.
He's out in the world
I'll get through the inner courtyard soon so I don't have to repeat myself too many times.
It's a relatively successful design, where my only objection is to the poor console.
I'd appreciate a little more designer invention here, since the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable, and where are the times when we complained about the short bottom of the seat or the elbows.
The side-steering is also significantly improved compared to the 206 model.
As for the space, you can see the body size increase here.
The head's few spots in the van disappear afterwards.
I'm going to put my fur in the trunk.
So the most important thing in this vehicle is the luggage compartment.
I must say that it is very accessible (also thanks to the rear fold-out window) and spacious.
The empty spaces are equipped with their own tanks, which are ideal compromises.
They're easy to break, and they can handle heavier objects.
But let's stick to volume for a while.
This table shows the base layout at 428 litres, which is rather an average value compared to the competition.
However, in the Czech Republic, the car of this class is not the most sought-after - compared to the Skoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation product from Mladá Boleslav, we find that Peugeot is far behind the noticeably many 52 litres.
For a holiday abroad or for the placement of a stroller, this value is almost critical.
But if I'm going to highlight the positives, I'm going to mention the almost perfectly straight floor after the second row of backs have been lowered, or the very low threshold.
120 horsepower in four rows
The car we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder, four-stroke engine with a displacement of 1.6 litres and a power output of 88 kW.
And to tell the truth, this is what the 1600 should look like, driving the family hatchback.
It's quiet, low-power, and mostly pulls.
Compared to the Škoda equivalent, which often feels like a rag is stuffed into the exhaust, I'm happy about that.
The price is high
The price of a car is not cheap.
But we must remember that we tested a car with a large interior and a very good engine.
The car with a four-cylinder engine will still go for 329,900 Kč.
The car starts at 410,990 Kč, which is quite a lot.
The premium equipment tested will cost the equipment an additional CZK 80,000.
But we had air bags, automatic air conditioning, automatic window wipers, electrical remote controls in the back windows...
So the car with the tow truck costs 531,900 Kč.
That's a lot, but count the Fabia accessories and you get a very similar result.
So there's nothing left but a decision in favor of the brand.
Failure to integrate Slovak students into British schools
The growing number of Eastern European children in British schools has raised concerns amongst local people about the further development of local schooling.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing a number of obstacles.
British schools have reported instances of arguments between immigrant and home-grown children escalating into violence.
The problems of integrating children from Eastern Europe are well illustrated by a case in northern Kent, where disputes between their places and Slovak immigrants are escalating.
The quarrels and fights between students are already characteristic of the parents' relationships.
The situation escalated to the point that in Chatham, police arrested a Slovak woman for beating a ten-year-old student with a stick.
The defendant defends himself by saying that the boy insulted him with racist slurs.
Police have had to act after two 12-year-old girls attacked Slovak immigrants.
The girls allegedly made racist remarks and threw stones at the man.
"On the way home, a boy climbed onto the bus stop and started to spit at us.
When I told her to stop, she hit us with apples and circles and then revealed her naked ass", the mother of the Slovak students described the latest embarrassment to The Times.
There are complaints from both sides.
One local resident described the dispute over Eastern European immigrants as a struggle for survival.
The above cases suggest that tensions are developing between locals and immigrants in British schools.
In the UK, there are 70,000 Slovaks looking for work.
About 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba - The Most Beautiful Island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your vacation, it can be done if you choose the right one.
The golden and white shores, the high waves, or the sea, calm as a fishboat.
Palm trees and all inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream or cocktails on the beach.
Surfing the beach, golfing and roulette.
In the Caribbean, you can find this in a more complete and even richer list.
But there is one island that is much more than that, Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Greater Antilles.
Under the Spanish, Cuba was a stronghold for their American conquests.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place that the human eye had ever seen.
Havana became a treasure-trove and a transshipment point for the Spanish who had captured America and shipped it to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Nacional Hotel was built in the late '20s.
Lucky Luciano, one of the American mob bosses, built it because everything that was considered a crime in the United States (mainly drugs) was welcomed in Cuba, and it encouraged drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were
I mean, you know, Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
Havana was built with high-rise buildings, and the broad streets were lined with cars that became a cult symbol of the 1950's.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, not far from Havana, and he had his own yacht in Cojimar.
The walls of the Bodeguita del Medio are decorated with the signatures of American entertainment stars and politicians.
What about today?
You can see the Bodeguita wall in Havana with your own handwriting.
The bar of the expensive Nacional Hotel will serve you a cocktail of your choice.
And the cult cars of the '50s still drive in Havana today, because the once-exported cigars and youngsters have long since rotted in this salty, damp air.
Although the oldest part of Havana has largely been destroyed, nowhere else in the region are there more beautiful colonial monuments.
Other places are getting better, like Trinidad.
Given that tourism provides much needed money, its development has been given a green light.
In the last 15 years, new hotels have been built not only in Havana but also in Varader, on the coast of the province of Holguín, and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo, and others.
Cuba offers another unique delicacy in the world, one that is especially appreciated by train enthusiasts.
From their vast plantations, sugarcane was transported to sugar factories by steam and motor trains.
Their fleet has not been renovated for decades, so you can see machines in operation that are only seen in museums.
Where are we going?
The most famous places are not avoided by most visitors to Cuba.
So it's not necessary to write too much about Varader or Havana.
Perhaps we should remind you that the aforementioned Hemingway estate has a museum, and if you love the writer, you should not miss a visit to this museum.
The Viňales Valley is one of the most picturesque parts of Cuba on the western side of the island.
The lush vegetation grows from the slaughterhouse.
Sandstone formations, limestone peaks, and rocks rise steeply from the valley floor, and the hollows are filled with fertile soil, which makes the crumbling slopes dense with vegetation.
The valley is a place where perhaps the best quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
You can see it in its final form when you visit a cigar factory in Havana.
Some may find it interesting that it was also the location of the filming of Major Zeman's Chilean episode.
The following is the list of the countries:
It's an ancient city founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
The slave and sugar trade brought fame and glory.
The economy was embodied in the beauty and monumentality of a not-so-large city.
Much influenced by later French settlers, colonial Spanish architecture remained virtually unchanged for four centuries.
So isolated is Trinidad between the Escambray Plain and the sea that even in the 1950's there were no roads connecting this region to the rest of the country.
That kind of isolation helped keep her out of the loop.
They didn't build anything, so they didn't tear it down, and everyone was happy to have a roof over their heads.
If you have more than one afternoon in Trinidad, it is worthwhile to visit the area's attractions, such as Playa Ancón Beach or the Valley of the Sugar Factories.
And in the evening, it's appropriate to go to the Casa de la Música, which revives after dark, where the music stops until morning.
Other
Some consider it the most beautiful city in the eastern part of Cuba.
Surely this opinion is already influenced by the journey itself.
Both routes from Guantanamo pass through high, rugged mountains and nature that has been little affected by human activity.
The eastern tongue of Cuba is a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its pristine nature.
The best chocolate is made here, the church has a cross of Columbus (actually made a hundred years after Columbus sailed) and from the hill where the former castle stood and today the El Castillo hotel stands, some hills can be seen, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
There is much to be said about coffee, rum, cigars, the plains of the Sierra Meastro, the Bay of Pigs and Isla de Pinos, the cabaret Tropicana, the patron saint of Caridad del Cobra in Cuba, Santeria, the African religion practiced by the descendants of former slaves.
So, as they say, it's better to see it once.
The Afghan allies are passive, the Americans claim
The lack of troops and the lack of necessary equipment also affects the conduct of the U.S. mission in Afghanistan.
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said NATO should outline concrete plans for the next few years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going as planned, the leaders of the countries that have units in the south of the country have agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing resistance of the Taliban movement, the eight participating countries are also discussing further plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States, with the assistance of Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, has called for increased NATO troop activity this week, Britain is prioritizing strengthening the Afghan government and strengthening development aid.
"The progress in Afghanistan is palpable, but military force can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow the population to take the lead in further improving the economy and security", British Defence Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
90 percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents is the strongest in the last five years, according to the US government.
The number of violent acts increased by 27 percent compared to last year, and in the southern province of Helmand by 60 percent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territories.
The United States, however, maintains that the Allies have reached their limits in the organization and equipment of their troops.
Specifically, additional helicopters, soldiers and experts were requested to train Afghan troops.
"We need to think seriously about the specific goals for the future and the ways to achieve them", Gates said.
The same spirit was expressed today by Jaap de Hoop, Secretary General of NATO.
"I'm not happy about what's happening in Afghanistan on the ground and in the air.
We have about 90 percent of the troops and equipment we need, and that's not enough", De Hoop told Reuters news agency at the end of a three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
There has also been debate among the participating countries in recent months as to whether all allies are doing their best in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans are present in relatively large numbers in Afghanistan.
But they were deployed in areas where the violence and the demands of combat are least, so they are not as high as we are in the south and east of the country", Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun this week called the German soldiers lazy.
"Afghan diaries have been uncovered: Germans play while our sons fight", the Sun wrote in a photo accompanying the German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild counterattacked and published a photo of a British rugby team playing in southern Afghanistan.
Public debt to reach one trillion in 2009
Each Czech has a state debt of 84,000 crowns.
The total debt reached DKK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
The government plans to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
However, by early December, the Ministry had reduced this plan by SEK 152.8 billion, thanks to the improved state budget.
The Czech Republic's public debt stood at DKK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
In the first nine months of this year, this figure rose by SEK 40,2 billion.
However, since June, it has decreased by SEK 13,4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance has confirmed the data on the government debt from the beginning of October.
Each check is more than 84,000 crowns in debt.
Last year, the state owed more than 11 billion crowns.
"For now, it looks like we could only cross the 1 trillion-krone mark in 2009 thanks to a lower deficit next year.
Next year, the debt will be around 900 billion and one trillion crowns", said David Marek, an analyst at Patria Finance, on the iHNed.cz server.
Similarly, Vladimir Pikora, an analyst at Next Finance, says: "We could pass the one trillion mark in 2009.
Exactly when, depends on the next budget, as yet unknown.
If it proves that the situation in the political sphere is changing, politicians will be willing to save more, and this could be postponed until 2010.
But I don't suppose that's the case", he said.
Growing debts
The public debt is the central government's debts, which are mainly formed by the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
The public debt is financed by cash certificates, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The internal indebtedness of the state has so far this year increased by 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The state's foreign debt has so far increased by 1,7 billion to 123,3 billion kroner.
The so-called marketable government debt reached DKK 803.3 billion at the end of September and decreased by DKK 13.7 billion from June.
The average maturity of the government debt has risen to 6.5 years.
"The total annual debt increased by 13 percent in the first quarter, which is quite high in relation to the progress of the economy.
Interestingly, the increase is generated primarily by bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt is increasing, but on the other hand it shows that there will be something to trade when the pension reform is here", Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the 2007 government debt management showed that the government planned to borrow 159,2 billion kronor this year.
However, by early December, the ministry had reduced the plan by 152.8 billion kronor, thanks to the better development of the state budget.
The amount is mainly the deficit in the state budget, which is likely to reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of the assumed 91,3 billion crowns.
In addition, the Czech Consolidation Agency is planning a maximum of CZK 13,3 billion, a reserve of CZK 10 billion for pension payments, CZK 43 billion for financing of government bonds and CZK 1,8 billion for repayment of loans from the European Investment Bank.
The teacher will appear before a court in Kartum today for naming a pig in a feather.
A court in Khartoum on Thursday night sentenced a British teacher to 15 days in jail and deportation for violating Islam in Sudan, her lawyer said.
A British woman has been accused of allowing her six- to seven-year-old students to name a stuffed pig Muhammad, but Islam forbids any depiction of the prophet.
Such an act is punishable by flogging.
The 54-year-old British woman, who teaches at Unity High School in Khartoum, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged under section 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code with insulting Islam and sedition after the parents of the students lodged multiple complaints against her with the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story began in September when a teacher asked her students, ages six to seven, to choose a name for the class's teddy bear.
"The children suggested eight names in all, including Hassan, Abdullah, and Muhammad", says Robert Boulos, the school principal.
In the end, 20 out of 23 children voted for the name Muhammad.
Of course, Muhammad is the name of the prophet of Islam, but it's also a very common first name in Sudan.
The children then made a diary together with a picture of the cat and the caption, "My name is Muhammad".
The problem is that any depiction of the Prophet is an insult to Islam.
Gillian Gibbons, a Muslim colleague who teaches at the same school, said she knew her well and that the teacher would never do anything that would offend any religious beliefs, and that she thought it was just an "innocent mistake", saying, "I'm just sorry you voted for the name with the kids".
Many of her students agree, saying that she "treats the children very well" and "never talks about religion in class".
Remember, in Britain, Mohammed is the second most popular first name, and there are 14 different spellings in English.
This is a name that Muslim families have so often chosen as a way to show respect for the prophet (often given to the firstborn child in the family).
But what rules apply to the use of the first name?
Can a toy be called that, for example?
That's obviously a matter of interpretation.
No agreement was reached at the last Vienna meeting on Wednesday on the future status of the province.
The end result is failure.
The sixth and final meeting between the Serbs and the Kosovo Albanians on the future status of the breakaway region ended without agreement on positions on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria.
"It is regrettable that the parties have not reached an agreement on the status", EU diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger told a press conference in Vienna.
U.S. Ambassador Frank Wisner stressed that peace in the region was "at stake" and urged Belgrade and Pristina to keep their pledges to maintain peace and dialogue after the talks.
"There is no danger of violence in the near future, but it is a very difficult time", he added, stressing the "evident tensions".
The broadcast ends on December 10th.
The mediation troika, which includes the European Union, the United States and Russia, will visit Serbia and Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the province, which is 90% Albanian, may be clarified after Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Bocan-Harchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The meeting in Baden, near Vienna, marked the sixth and final meeting of the negotiations since the UN entrusted the troika with another mediation task in August last year.
The Americans and Europeans believe that their mediation task will end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already thwarted the issue of Kosovo's independence in the Security Council, insist that negotiations continue after the deadline.
"Russia has been committed and will remain committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise", Bocan-Harchenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of UN control, the Western powers believe that independence under EU control is the only viable solution.
Pristina stated that he was ready to declare independence unilaterally if the Security Council decided against him.
Belgrade would continue to support greater autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have not been able to reach an agreement", said the president of the independent region of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the Baden hotel where "last-chance negotiations" have been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo insurgency and future premier of the province, also expressed regret.
However, he added that his idea of Belgrade's autonomy would be "a continuation of the past, which has been steeped in murder and deportations".
"Domino effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadic believed that a compromise was still possible and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo of the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence.
Belgrade fears a "domino effect" in a region still unstable because of the wars of independence in the 1990s.
"For Serbia, this does not exclude the possibility of compromise", Tadic said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation reiterated that the decision should be made exclusively by the Security Council, where its Russian ally has veto power.
"The Kosovo parliament will have the final say"
"For Serbia, only a solution approved by the Security Council is acceptable", declared the Serbian Prime Minister, Vojislav Kostunica.
"The negotiations lasted for two years.
They must end where they began: in the Security Council".
Fatmir Sejdiu told reporters that "the Kosovo parliament will have the final say", adding that the Albanian unilateral declaration of independence is based on an "agreement" with Western powers.
Bush urges an agreement between Israel and Palestine
President George Bush on Tuesday, at the opening of the international peace conference he hosted in Annapolis, Maryland, announced that Israel and Palestine had finally agreed to sign a joint declaration.
Bush said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas have agreed to begin negotiations immediately to resolve the 60-year-old dispute between their peoples.
Bush promised in the presence of both presidents to support them in every way possible in order to sign the "sale agreement" in 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must dismantle "terrorist networks" and Israel must abandon its colonial activities, Bush said, reminding the two sides of their commitments under the "peace agenda" agreed in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that the goal of the Abbas-led Palestinian Authority-Israel talks is "to sign a peace treaty that resolves all outstanding issues, including the central issues".
The latter concern three sensitive issues at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute: the future borders of Palestine, the situation in Jerusalem, and the fate of Arab refugees displaced from their homes during the 1948 conflict who lived in the territory of the modern state of Israel.
Speaking after the US president, Abbas insisted that the future talks be "global and in-depth" and cover all areas of regulation, such as "Jerusalem, asylum, borders, colonies, water and security".
Olmert then promised that future negotiations would be "immediate and continuous" and that he would seek to "finish them in 2008".
Bush set a target for the end of 2008 for the realization of the "vision of two states" for Israel and Palestine, which would exist side by side.
Saudi Arabia said it had received a promise from Bush before it decided to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia (whose Annapolis participation was hailed as a success by Washington) with the support of all Arab countries, has initiated a plan that guarantees peace to Israel in return for withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis "is an answer to the history of the Middle East, especially because it captures the problem at its root and focuses on the central issues", the Saudi prince said in an interview with the Saudi-owned Arab daily.
The prosecutor says the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is usually the case with news of this kind, the official position and the rumor contradict each other.
How did the accident happen?
According to the first data of the investigation initiated by the General Inspectorate of the National Police (IGPN), a police car passed on Louise-Michel Street in Villiers-le-Bel on Sunday, a few minutes after 5pm.
"The car was on patrol, so it was not in action. It was going at 40-50 km/h without siren", a police source told us.
The two helmetless youths were driving "at high speed" on a green Kawasaki motorcycle, "not registered and therefore not suitable for road use" (see below).
"Because the right-hand rule was not followed, the motorcycle hit the left side of the police car", says one policeman.
The alcohol test on the passengers in the vehicle came back negative.
The impact was so severe that the front of the car was blown off, the windshield was cracked and the bumper was torn off.
Pontoise's public prosecutor, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, said in an emergency announcement yesterday morning that she had charged IGPN and the Val-D'Oise County Public Security Directorate with investigating "reckless homicide and failure to assist".
During the afternoon, the prosecutor told a press conference that at the current stage of the IGPN investigation, the police can be excluded from responsibility.
The prosecutor said three witnesses to the accident who were questioned Sunday night confirmed "the police report that the scooter came relatively quickly from the left side of the police car".
Yesterday, a strip of road, undoubtedly drawn by pedestrians, showed that the two vehicles were in collision and were traveling together for a while until the police car failed to brake.
The vehicles were seized for technical inspection.
Both victims were examined by the medical examiner yesterday.
What happened immediately after that?
There was a rumor in Villiers-le-Bel yesterday that the police had left the scene quickly without providing any assistance to the two young men.
In this regard, the IGPN is cautious, but excludes that the police have committed "any serious mistakes".
"This is the most difficult part of the investigation, which requires even more thorough investigation and increased caution in the process", a police source told us.
Libération met with an eyewitness who reported the minutes after the accident.
One of the windows in his apartment looks right at the scene.
"My cousin, who is a hospital nurse, and I went down immediately to try to resuscitate them", the witness relates.
"There was nothing we could do".
Then he noticed "a policeman who was completely confused and twisted.
The other two tried to revive one young man, and the fourth called".
Tensions mounted among those present as the two young men's desperate plight became apparent, and arriving police officers drove their colleagues from the scene.
We also know from the witness' account that the ambulance arrived "about 20 minutes after the police had left".
They also used a heart massage, but to no avail.
"I wouldn't say that the police didn't try to help the young people.
The young ones did get help.
The fire department arrived immediately.
Everything was done to save them", the prosecutor stressed.
Tensions are rising in Pakistan
On Monday, Pakistani police stopped the first demonstrations after the state of emergency declared by General Musarraf two days earlier.
Witnesses said that in the eastern city of Lahore, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against the emergency measures were injured by tear gas bombs used by law enforcement.
They responded by throwing stones at the police, injuring several of them.
They've produced at least 350 lawyers.
Similar incidents have occurred in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and injured lawyers.
They've produced multiple individuals.
In Islamabad, lawyers registered with the Supreme Court have called for a general strike and protests over the arrest of some 500 opposition members, human rights activists and lawyers over the weekend.
On Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were blocked to prevent the gathering.
There were also protests in Multan in the central part of the country and Peshawar in the northwest.
Since Monday, the movement of lawyers has been supported by the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance of religious parties, whose leader "encouraged the people to send flowers to judges who disagree with the state of emergency and garbage to those who have taken oaths before Musarraf".
'Musarraf's promise is no longer valid'
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the emergency measure announced on Saturday night.
The Court will rule in the coming days on the legality of the re-election of President Musarraf by indirect vote on 6 October.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been removed from his post and replaced.
"All that we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court's rulings", the president told The News.
President Pervez Musarraf's promise to leave the military to take on the role of civilian president has "lost its validity" after the state of emergency was declared, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem announced on Monday.
Musarraf was ordered to strip off his military uniform until November 15, the end of his first term as president.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed the news of the postponement of the January elections.
The Pakistani government has denied the nationwide rumor that a deputy general has assigned President Musarraf to a forced housing camp.
More than one third of pregnancies are unplanned
This result includes unintended pregnancies (24%), or unplanned pregnancies or not planned at all.
Even today, more than a third (36%) of pregnancies are unplanned, according to a study by the French National Demographic Institute (INED), 40 years after the Neuwirth Law liberalizing contraception was passed.
This result includes unintended pregnancies (24%), or unplanned pregnancies or not planned at all.
Ined estimates that different methods of contraception, such as the pill or the IUD, still fail in 5-6% of cases.
However, the institute says that liberalisation of contraception has made "birth control" more effective. The study notes that in 1970 only 5% of women between the ages of 20 and 44 were taking the pill, but today that proportion is 60%.
Today, eight out of 10 pregnancies are planned.
One in five plans with a few months' notice, and if possible, in the spring, the most favorable time of year to adopt a child.
Scenic repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) spent more than seven hours in space repairing a torn solar panel, a spectacular feat essential to the station's scientific activities.
This dangerous spacewalk proved to be a record in many ways: it took a very long time to repair, very little time to plan, and it had to be done away from the residential modules, with tools "made" by astronauts.
The problem arose on Tuesday when astronauts detached from Discovery's Harmony module, a giant cylindrical element that will soon be the site of European and Japanese scientific laboratory activities (see boxed section).
This module is a kind of gateway to the lab modules.
However, their electricity supply must be taken care of.
The second task of the crew was to move one of the modules that were already on the ISS, which generated electricity using 17.5 tons of solar panels, to its final location.
The crew then began to open the module's 76-meter-wide solar panels.
One of the harmonically folding boards was damaged by a clogged cable about three feet [1 m] long.
The tablet was not opened further to avoid further damage.
The astronauts' original job was to take a test ride off the Discovery spacecraft and then repair another faulty rotating solar panel, instead spending their entire time repairing the damaged solar panel.
Scott Parazynski was chosen to perform the demonstration hanging from a 100-foot-long robotic arm attached to the station's crane.
He's one of the best astronauts at NASA.
He's tall, strong, extremely skilled, muscular upper body and long arms.
So the 46-year-old medical graduate had to "operate" on the "damaged" solar panel.
After carefully assessing the damage, he cut the faulty cable and fixed the damaged area with a few "slides".
He was assisted in his work by another "spaceman" who remained near the safe passage, as well as other astronauts from inside, including crew captain Peggy Whitson.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick insulated from hundreds of volts of solar panels, was invented and "barricaded" by the station's spacecraft.
After the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for his teammates to fully open the board, and only then packed his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts took a half-day break, and today, seven of them returned to the space shuttle Discovery to begin their scheduled return home on Wednesday.
The EADS share price is falling
The price of EADS shares fell sharply on the Paris Stock Exchange after the aircraft and defence equipment manufacturer announced that the delay in the development of the A400M would result in additional costs of EUR 1,2 to 1,4 billion.
The price trend for EADS shares is currently EUR 21,96 after a 4% decline.
The company was forced to revise its forecasts for the operating result in 2007 due to the delay in the development of the A400M engine, which obviously postponed the delivery of the aircraft.
The delay in the delivery of the combat transport aircraft, announced in October, 'will cost between €1.2 and €1.4 billion, of which more than €1 billion will be for Airbus', the parent company of the European EADS manufacturer said.
The Commission notes that the EADS has not provided any additional information on the financial situation of the company.
The group also indicated that it took into account the six-month delay when preparing its new cost estimate.
In 2006, EADS's operating result decreased by 86%, largely due to the delay in the development of another programme, the A380 giant aircraft, which also placed a heavy financial burden on the company.
The company originally planned to deliver the A400M to the French Army in October 2009.
The status quo remains
Sunday's election promises no big surprises: the vast majority of Russians will vote for Putin's party, United Russia.
This is a reflection of the Russian need for stability, for, say, arbitrary governance, after a highly manipulated campaign.
Today, three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin is addressing voters through public broadcasts in a televised message that has been recorded but is still classified.
Putin leads the pro-Kremlin party, United Russia, which is expected to win a landslide election.
At the reception of foreign ambassadors yesterday, the president's behavior revealed nothing: he only made another outburst against Western intervention, which was his favorite theme during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy, and we want honest, absolutely transparent and open elections, without any violation of rights", he added.
The opposition, however, says that this is not necessarily the case.
The opposition condemns the campaign, which they say was used to pressure voters.
Communist Party leader Gennagyi Zyuganov claims that "this kind of dirty election was not even in Russia during Yeltsin's time".
After the crackdown on the protests last weekend, former world chess champion Garri Kasparov was sentenced to five days in prison for unauthorized demonstration and his lawyer says he is still not allowed to visit.
"The Russians are still thinking like homo sovieticus"
Predictable election results raise two even more obvious questions:
Who's running behind Putin in the presidential race?
The official gazette published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, which will be on 2 March 2008, and candidates can indicate their intention to run until 23 December.
As Vladimir Putin was re-elected in 2000 and 2004, his term of office cannot be extended any further.
But there's no other successor in sight.
- What role has Putin played since March?
You're going to be Prime Minister?
Or as the leader of the all-powerful United Russia party or the parliamentary majority, will he decide the government and the president?
Whatever happens, the outgoing government will win both the parliamentary and presidential elections.
It's become a tradition.
"Russians still think in a 'homo sovieticus' way: they don't feel they can control their own destiny", says sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent Levada Center.
Nikolai Koposov, a historian at St. Petersburg University, goes further: According to his theory, the country became Christian 500 years later than Europe, so that civil society is lagging behind, and the traditional community spirit has retarded the development of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990's, "Putin reverted to a paternalistic model that was perfectly suited to the people, especially since this new kind of paternalism was not accompanied by intimidation but by a certain economic prosperity", says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, Russians "willfully refuse personal responsibility", which quickly became apparent after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
"Why should we think?"
The phenomenon affects all layers of society, including the business world.
The administrative elite is interested in maintaining the current situation: the local lists of United Russia are headed by 65 governors, who are excluded from the heads of the 85 Russian regions.
And freedom imported from the West often embodies chaos, as it did in the 1990s.
The public is more interested in stability.
In the spirit of this, Russians don't vote for extremist parties either.
Tamara Cherednychenko, a 54-year-old teacher, concludes: "Why should we think?
The people in power aren't so bad, so why should we replace them?"
Depressing Memories
After more than 60 years of secrecy, the Bad Arolsen archive has been made public, documenting the fate of the 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime.
The 47 million archival documents, which occupy 27 kilometres of shelves in Bad Arolsen in the state of Hesse, have so far been searchable only for 'humanitarian' purposes, i.e. they have provided unique and anonymous access to the victims or their descendants.
In May 2006, 11 countries, including Germany, France, Israel, and the United States, agreed to open the archive to researchers and historians.
After all the states ratified the convention, the archives were opened yesterday.
Confidential information
The opening of the Bad Arolsen library will allow historians to conduct research "on the transfer of prisoners, the inhabitants of the camps, and the health of forced laborers", explains Reto Meistern, director of the archive run by the International Committee of the Red Cross.
Until now, several states, including Germany, have opposed the release of the documents, as they contain names and therefore confidential information.
For example, some deported victims may have a presumed homosexuality or mental disability.
After the war, the Gestapo began collecting concentration camp records and arrest warrants for practical reasons, to search for civilians who had been deported or sentenced to forced labor and to provide evidence of their internment, which could be used to obtain compensation.
More than 300 permanent staff are already working in Bad Arolsen to handle tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, some in the academic community do not consider the opening of the Bad Arolsen archive to be of great significance.
"These documents are basically nothing new", said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for Research on Anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin, in 2006.
EU and India to sign free trade agreement in 2008
The annual volume of Indo-European bilateral trade is now approaching EUR 60 billion.
The EU is India's number one trading partner, accounting for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and Indian Trade Minister Kamal Nath announced.
EU foreign ministers approved in April last year that the European Commission should start negotiations on free trade agreements with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India's number one trading partner, accounting for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also India's largest foreign investor, but India is only the EU's ninth largest trading partner according to the European Commission.
Peter Mandelson explained that "a free trade agreement could be a boost to both sides" and "could increase India's presence in a booming market of 450 million people".
Europe is the primary or secondary importer of the top 10 goods exported by India, added the European Commissioner.The two giants, Europe and Asia, exchange "€47 billion worth of goods" and "€10 billion worth of services" each year, said Danièle Smadja, Head of the European Commission Delegation in New Delhi.At the same time, she regretted that bilateral trade "has not always reached its full potential".The EU and India will meet in New Delhi on Friday for the eighth diplomatic summit, attended by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and José Manuel Durao Barroso, President of the European Commission.
The Commission has not yet decided on the measures to be taken.
Answer to concerns: Bank of England offers £10 billion to the money market over five weeks
The Bank of England, which wants to ease the uncertainty over its lending conditions, announced on Thursday that it is pumping £10 billion into the money market, making it available at a base rate of 5.75% and a five-week maturity unlike usual.
"We want to ease concerns that the financial market conditions will be particularly bad at the end of the year, and we want banks to be able to plan their liquidity position more securely for this period. Therefore, the Bank is offering a significant part of its reserves on the international financial market as part of a five-week open market operation from 6 December", the bank said in a press release.
The bank said that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be released on the market on December 6 at 12:15 local time, at the central bank's base rate, with a repayment deadline of January 10.
This is the first time that the Bank of England has issued liquidity for five weeks in an open market operation.
The duration of such operations is usually one week.
In its press release, the Bank of England added that it was "ready to take further measures" to bring interbank lending into line with the central bank's base rate.
The current interbank rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has exceeded the level of 18 September, currently at 6.6%.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the Bank of England has charged significant penalty interest on money pumped into the money market, which has deterred banks from using it.
According to rumors (which are only reinforced by the evolution of the pound against the euro), many would have been more happy with the resources offered by the European Central Bank, which they could have accessed at a more favourable rate of interest and with greater discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to examine the socialist proposal on purchasing power
The UMP and the Nouveau Centre group on Thursday refrained from discussing the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which is tantamount to rejecting the text itself.
The text, which was discussed at a meeting initiated by the Socialists, contained around 10 measures adopted by the Socialist Party's national office on Tuesday, including a 50% increase in the employment allowance, the reintroduction of variable fuel, the introduction of travellers' checks and a reduction in rent.
With the UMP and the NC voting 180 to 115 against the articles, the discussion between the ruling party and the opposition, which occasionally turned into sharp exchanges, was interrupted just hours before President Nicolas Sarkozy's televised speech on purchasing power.
The leader of the Socialist delegation, Jean-Marc Ayrault, announced that his group would re-submit all its proposals as part of the amendment to the amending financial bill, which will be on the agenda of the National Assembly next week.
A new festival is born
There have been many rumors about the new Philadelphia music festival being organized by C3 Presents, but now the event's promoter and organizer has announced that the Vineland music festival will be held in New Jersey in partnership with Melvin Benn's British production company, Festival Republic.
"We are honored to be working with a man who is the driving force behind the modern American festival movement", Charlie Jones of C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 also hosts the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits music festival.
The New Jersey Vineland Festival is in the summer, so there's plenty of camping.
The festival will be held August 8-10, at a private 500-acre site about 40 minutes outside of Philadelphia.
The director of Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the most respected festival organizers in the world.
In 1989 he started organising the British Reading Festival, which attracts around 80,000 visitors each year.
In 1999 Melvin Benn further expanded his range by organising the Leeds Festival, and in 2006 Festival Republic launched the Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has been involved in the production, licensing and organising of the Glastonbury Festival as co-owner, which now has a capacity of 177,500.
C3's Charlie Jones called the Glastonbury Festival "the most inspiring event" he had ever attended, adding that his company and Melvin Benn's are working in parallel to enrich the region with a European-style festival.
"We've already selected the Philadelphia location, and we've worked hard with the Fairmount Parks Commission to get this festival in the heart of Philadelphia", said Charlie Jones.
"We have been in discussions with the city and the Commission has been very enthusiastic about our plan.
Sadly, however, the political maneuvers of the city administration have led to the organization's failure".
"We were fortunate to be able to talk to Melvin Benn about this, "and now we're preparing to hold a huge festival in another unique venue "that will ultimately serve the interests of the people of Philadelphia".
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Grant Park in Chicago, after already proving its exceptional festival organizing talent in 2002 with the Austin City Limits music festival.
The gross revenue of the two events in 2007 was $9.8 million and $11.3 million, respectively.
Both festivals were held in urban locations.
"Melvin Benn's European concept is based on the rural festival, whereas our festivals are usually held in urban green spaces", says Charlie Jones.
Our aim is to combine the two models in some way, and thus create both the European rural atmosphere and the American urban experience".
Vineland is located about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The people of Vineland, including the mayor himself, are very supportive", says Charlie Jones.
While he did not elaborate on the details of the agreement, he did say that "the conditions are favourable enough to allow investment in an event of this size in a venue that will hopefully be a long-term home for the festival".
According to Charlie Jones, the festival will be "huge" in size, with a capacity roughly equivalent to the 80,000-seat Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
The bands have already received invitations to the event, but at the time of the press conference, nothing is final.
"Vineland is basically going to be a rock festival, but we're planning a variety of music to suit everyone", says Charlie Jones.
Jones and two partners, Charlie Walker and Charles Attal, form C3, which was named "Best Independent Event Planner" at the most recent Billboard Touring Awards.
Montreal is facing the Terminator.
It's not easy to lure Hollywood directors to Montreal when you're up against the Terminator...
"Spooks" is one of the Montreal delegate's duties.
The mission promises to be "politically difficult" as California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger opposes filming his own productions abroad.
Is it really hard to take on the Terminator Governor?
"We have to be careful, because the film industry decides which is the best place for it.
If you find Montreal favorable, that's where you'll go.
Our job is to offer the best possible terms, and they decide for us", says Schwarzenegger.
Competition for festivals
Denis Turcotte, however, is now focused on promoting Canadian films.
The Oscars are in the running.
The goal is to showcase and promote as many Quebec films as possible at every American film festival, whether it's the Sundance Film Festival, the Denver, Seattle or San Francisco film festivals.
The film L'Âge des ténèbres was well received a few weeks ago at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival.
It's also going to be screened at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil will be shown in Santa Monica and at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Québec also presented four short films and four feature films at this month's American Film Institute Fest.
The experts are divided on the subprime crisis
With less than five weeks to go before the end of the fiscal year, investors are already rubbing their hands and looking forward to the usual year-end hair.
This year, however, it is not clear to experts whether this will actually happen.
According to Banif, "statistically, the stock market is generally positive in December.
However, forecasts based solely on statistics are not necessarily correct and, in fact, the current situation is characterised by uncertainty in the market, at least in the short term.'
The experts are not in favour of a year-end stock market rally, although they state that 'the stock market is sustained by the presence of liquidity, which gives an opportunity to invest, as there is a lack of guaranteed alternatives, in particular fixed yields, which are negatively affected by the move towards quality securities, both in the long and short term'.
They therefore believe that the stock market will be more of a sideways, non-volatile move, "especially as the impact of the Fed rate cut is not yet known, with high crude oil prices and the threat of inflationary stress".
Javier Barrio, BPI's sales manager in Spain, agrees, meaning he also thinks it would be risky to announce a rally.
The expert says "things are not so rosy".
The loss of Ibex is close to 4% from the highest recorded on November 8th when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
Despite all this, not all experts are so far-sighted.
Intermoney analyst Juan Solana believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year closer to 16,000 points due to the reorganization of the wallets and the usual pension fund payments.
However, the expert adds that some changes are expected this year, as the rally is postponed to the second week of December, the week after the long weekend of the Constitution Day.
The analyst considers it unlikely that volatility would affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, we are close to the technical level and "therefore we may experience a decline in the stock market index, which may rise depending on news from the USA regarding the consequences of the credit market crisis".
The analyst is confident that these will be favorable.
Analysts agree on which securities will aim to reach the new maximum quotas of Ibex.
Solana, from Intermoney, stresses that "it's the big stocks that are next".
The expert would include two large banks and a few construction companies, "since by then the electricity sector will be very expensive".
Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco states that the increase is due to the banking and industrial sectors.
The rally could be positive for construction companies, too, if it happens at all.
"The ACS has been trying to regain its position for several months and we hope that Ferrovial and the FCC construction companies will follow in this path", says the expert.
Cyclical consumption will be the main driver for the rest of the year due to the increase in sales during the Christmas sales period.
On the other hand, the expert also considers that technology companies can do well, although they are not very well represented in this area on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years.
In the last seven years, there have only been two December price fluctuations.
The real year-end rally was in 2003, when the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the bursting of the technology bubble.
In this year, when the Ibex 35 corrected back 28.17 percent, in December they recorded a jump of 6.68 percent.
It remains therefore open whether 2007 will be the fifth consecutive year of profitability (currently the Ibex is up 8.36% since January) and whether the final rally can take place.
Banco Popular Español 200 opens a branch open 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
Banco Popular Español has decided to renew most of its branches.
This concerns a total of 200 branches in the most commercially affected parts of Spain.
The accounts mentioned are run under the name Popular Max and will be a major change for the bank.
But also for the other Spanish institutions, as this is the first group whose branches are open until 8.30 p.m. on a regular basis, and even on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 8.30 p.m.
The other group, BBVA, which has also repeatedly indicated that it plans to extend the opening of its branches, has not yet taken the necessary steps.
But he's just now making a deal with the unions that he'll close 75% of his branches in exchange for opening them one afternoon, though not to the public.
The experience of Banco Popular Español will be crucial for other institutions, as it will be their basis for deciding whether to join an initiative to promote more favourable business opening.
This is the objective of the Banco Popular Español project.
I would like to target individuals, SMEs, sole proprietors and local businesses shopping in these places.
The Bank would like to operate its 200 branches throughout Spain with the aforementioned opening times for 18 months, as this is not a new opening times scheme but a transformation of the existing one.
To this end, the institution upgrades its branches in the commercial areas according to the needs of the customers of each street.
This extension of opening hours is accompanied by a new conception of the nature of the drawers, a more modern, colourful design.
Ángel Rivera, head of commercial banks, points out that the restructuring does not require a large investment but requires more staff, which means eight or nine employees per branch instead of the current six.
The booths, which will also accommodate negotiators for SMEs, will also sell non-financial products.
Good experiences
The initiative has already been implemented in three branches of Banco Popular Español in Madrid.
Angel Rivero said the experience was positive.
The choice was made for the branches in Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía in Madrid, and Rivero said that the decision was the right one.
Banco Popular Español currently has 2,500 branches.
Another 60 operate under the name Mundocredit, specialising in immigrants, and also have very favourable opening hours, even on Sundays and holidays.
The units of PopularMax do not use the BBVA model, where certain branches offer a wide range of non-financial products.
"We don't want to create competition for our customers", Rivero points out.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica and will sell mobile phones with the help of external staff.
Telecinco for the first time doubles the stock price of its rival Antena 3
"We did it".
With this sentence, Paolo Vasile, the advisor of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction at the closing of the market yesterday, when it was revealed that the TV company he was running had doubled the value of its rival, Antena 3.
But something overshadowed his joy: "The only pain is that it's not because we've gone up more, but because we've gone down less", he said.
Even so, he put a lot of emphasis on "falling short" in a weak market.
Telecinco closed yesterday with a 2.54 percent gain.
This increase brings the annual loss to 15.66%.
The company is 52% owned by Mediaset, 13% by Vocento, giving it a stock market value of EUR 4,488.88 million, according to Bloomberg.
Its rival, Antena 3, lost 1.52% yesterday and could see a 40.5% drop since January, so it's half that yesterday, 2,193.46 million.
The other listed communications companies are worth 3,571 million for Sogecable, 2,518,53 million for Prisa (publisher of Cinco Días) and 1,779 million for Vocento.
Vasile argues that the comparison with Antena 3 is due to the similarity between the two companies.
The question is, how much can we do in the same market, at what cost, and how does that translate into viewership?
Telecinco announced last week that it wants to become the first TV channel to exceed 1 billion in gross advertising revenue this year, said Giuseppe Tringali, a senior adviser to Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group's advertising subsidiary.
If the notified event were to take place, the TV channel would increase its advertising revenue by 3,6% in the current financial year compared to 965,4 million committed in 2006.
Net sales of Antena 3 increased by 1,6% in the first nine months of the financial year (to 734,4 million), while net sales of television increased by 0,7% (630,4 million).
According to analysts, one of the factors that triggered the boost in Telecinco's stock market was the high level of pay-out that had been maintained up to that time: in 2006 the company, headed by President Alejandro Echevarría, distributed 100% of its profits to its shareholders.
According to Vasile, although it is too early to decide, this proportion may change after the acquisition of 33% of Endemol in association with its parent company Mediaset.
"We officially guarantee a minimum of 50% payment, although we have always given out much more.
I hope our shareholders will be pleased with us this year, as we have already made them happy with the acquisition of 33% of Endemol".
Analysts say that the market is currently characterised by some weakness.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its valuation of Telecinco by 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
According to them, this is due to the estimated decrease in sales growth from 10,5% to 8,4% in 2008 and from 5,5% to 5,1% in 2009.
The same company forecasts that Antena 3's profits will fall by 4,5% in 2008 and by 7,5% in 2009.
3 opinions
The first.
Ibersecurities: proposes to purchase both securities, mainly because of their high dividend yield and long-term sustainable potential.
The second.
Caja Madrid: considers Telecinco to be more favourable (acquisition) than Antena 3 (reserve) because of its 'multiple attractiveness' and business strength.
The third.
JPMorgan: in both cases, it proposes underweighting on the basis of 'similar risks' (full market and less favourable economic climate).
Congress approves the adoption of MiFID, which goes into effect on November 1st.
In parallel with the parliamentary process, which ended today with a congressional vote approving the Senate amendments, the government has initiated a social dialogue on the regulations underlying the law so that both can come into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups unanimously highlighted the efforts made by the Members and Senators in negotiations and agreements to establish the most favourable rules for the protection of investors and to regulate the activities of companies in detail in order to ensure the efficient functioning of the market.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Markets Act, allows for the modernisation of financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, extending the supervisory powers of the Spanish National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various supervisors in the European Union.
The new Directive allows for the provision of financial advice to specialist firms, but also to natural or legal persons, and creates a new form of financial service provider (ESIS) in addition to securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies, namely financial advisory firms (AFI).
In addition, the Act increases the number of systems capable of executing operations involving funds, thus adding to the regulated secondary markets multilateral trading platforms and order-filling internalisations which compete with existing stock exchange operators.
The Act also requires investment firms to provide market information on the aspects that determine their business profile, risk-taking and risk management methods, and to facilitate the control of the CNMV, they must keep records of all transactions carried out.
The House Committee on Economic Affairs has made a number of changes, most notably treating securitised debt as a "complex" asset because of the high risk to the investor, which is a fact of the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis.
On the other hand, the transposition of the directive has also been used to legally define the scope of activities of those with economic and business qualifications, 30 years after the Royal Decree of 1977 which defined the professional functions exclusively for economists came into force.
The Senate also proposed the creation of new players in the financial sector, such as an intermediary agent who works for another account, does not need the authorisation of the CNMV and can simultaneously market products or acquire clients for several investment companies.
The Consumer Price Index increased by 0.5 points in November to reach 4.1%.
This figure, which Eurostat takes into account for the calculation of the European Union inflation rate, shows the price developments in Spain for the month of November.
Its publication is in line with the strategy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank to provide data that are comparable to data from the United States, both in terms of their timing and nature.
The provisional figure is calculated using the same methodology as the Unified Price Index, but the statistical modelling method is different for estimating information not yet available at the time of disclosure.
The Statistical Office stressed that the preliminary figure is for information only and may therefore differ from the final figures to be published on 14 December.
'The Consumer Price Index is still relatively high.'
Pedro Solbes, one of the vice-presidents of the government and Minister of Economy, stated that the increase in the Consumer Price Index to 4,1% in November is only "temporary", but at the same time he predicted that the price index is expected to show a "relatively high" value in the coming months.
In the corridors of Parliament, Solbes confirmed that "although the figure is not very favourable", the inflation rate in Spain has remained more or less the same within the monetary union in recent years.
He also added that the month of November was "less surprising" than the previous month, when the Government did not expect such a large increase.
"We expected a value of around 4%", the Minister of Economy acknowledged in relation to the data released today.
Virgin wants to raise 42 billion euros through Northern Rock over three years.
Northern Rock's deposits have fallen by more than 50% to just £12 billion (€16 billion 800 million) since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to take out an emergency loan from the Bank of England.
At the time, it had a record £25 billion in deposits, which have been gradually reduced over the past two and a half months by a loss of customer confidence, despite the Government's promise of a 100% guarantee to the bank by the end of the crisis.
Virgin will operate this unit under its own financial, commercial name, Virgin Money. Virgin will need to capture around a quarter of UK banks' revenues over the next three years to capture the remaining £18 billion and reach the £30 billion target.
The group of Richard Branson, a prominent businessman who has become known for his high-profile advertising campaigns in England, intends to spend some £50 million (€70 million) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve his goal.
Northern Rock this week highlighted the Virgin Consortium's bid as the most favorable to avoid bankruptcy, with three other companies forming the consortium.
The mayor of Totana has been arrested on suspicion of corruption.
The police arrested the mayor of Totana, in the province of Murcia, at dawn today, on suspicion of involvement in a corruption scandal that broke out in the city this week.
Besides him, a secretary of the City Hall and the police chief of the municipality were arrested.
Former City Council Member José Martínez Andreo took over in May from Popular Party MP Juan Morales, who, according to official bodies interviewed by SER radio, was the head of the corruption network.
Police are continuing to investigate at city offices and the Urban Development Board, and it is not excluded that more arrests are expected.
Juan Morales' lawyer has also been investigated as the prime suspect in a corruption scandal that broke out this week.
According to SER radio, the lawyer of the Popular Party Juan Morales was arrested as he was leaving Morales with corruption documents in his bag.
Police sources say the subject of the investigation is the alleged commission Morales received in exchange for signing a development agreement with a Galician construction company to redevelop 200 acres of land.
Eight people are currently in custody.
Bono will accept the PSOE's candidacy in Toledo and the office of President of the Parliament if they win the election.
Former Minister of Defence José Bono accepted the offer of the Prime Minister and also the Secretary General of the Socialist Party, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to lead the list of the PSOE in Toledo in the next parliamentary elections and to take the position of President of the Parliament if the Socialists win the elections.
This was announced by the PSOE's Secretary General, José Blanci, at a press conference and confirmed by Bono himself at the party's federal headquarters after a meeting with Zapatero this afternoon.
The Prime Minister justified his choice of the former minister by saying that "we have to count on the best" in politics, and Bono is "among the best".
He also added that the Manchai politician would "probably" be the Socialist Party's candidate for the post of President of Parliament if the Socialists won the next elections.
Bono would take over from current parliamentary president Manuel Marín, who announced on November 15 that he would not run in the next election and would give up his political career and instead fight against climate change in scientific circles.
The former minister admitted that the Prime Minister has been constantly besieging him to return to the political arena since he stopped active politics two years ago.
He also added that since voters are aware of who will be the economic vice-president in the event of a Socialist victory, the party would also like to inform them of who will be the president of Parliament "in the interest of transparency".
If Bono is indeed to take office, he would like Parliament to be "a place of respect and not of insults or shouting" and to be more like the home of the citizens.
"Sometimes, unfortunately, it seems that Parliament is the only place in Madrid where one cannot talk peacefully, there have been 26 interruptions of the Prime Minister's speech in the Senate".
At the same time, he praised the current president, Manuel Marin, for his "excellent work", but he did not want to present himself as president already, lest his opponents consider him "an imposter".
Campaign for the climate
Since the climate change movement is relentlessly persecuting both those who are skeptical of its predictions and those who favor political or social battles, it must be very strong.
You should even have a political leader like Prime Minister Zapatero who thinks the movement is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and proclaims that "we need to make a new deal with our Earth".
However, this remark raises the question of the extent to which the activity or inactivity of its government has contributed to Spain's leading position within the Union in non-compliance with the Kyoto Convention.
Who is responsible for the non-compliance, which sector is affected and why has the government not tried to avoid it?
It should also clearly explain to the Spanish what measures it intends to take to curb climate change.
Which companies will be affected by these measures, what habits will need to be changed, what individual and societal energy savings will be expected and what economic consequences will be the result?
So who has to make sacrifices and who has to pay to save our planet?
But we haven't had, and we won't have, an explanation for these questions.
Exactly because it's about sacrifice and money.
Climate change measures, the actual measures, are always unpopular.
They are costly, inconvenient and costly to both companies and the public.
Even the PSOE's gasoline increase would have meant such unpopularity before the election that Zapatero quickly withdrew.
So we have to save the Earth from nothing, with nothing but propaganda, empty slogans, no real consequences.
With conventions, committees, protocols, new offices.
The agreement with the Earth, as the Prime Minister says, who speaks so beautifully in the election campaign, does not demand, does not attack, even beautifies the election meetings and awakens tenderness in us.

The mayor and the police chief of Totana have been arrested in a suspected corruption case
Police arrested the mayor of Totana, Murcai province, José Martínez Andreo, the local police chief, the city clerk and a hospitality entrepreneur for crimes related to urban development, police sources said today.
The mayor was arrested at his home and then transferred to the City Hall, where he is currently being held with several police officers, many of whom are investigating at the Urban Development Council and the municipal body in charge of managing industrial estates and housing.
The three arrests came ahead of the six people arrested on Monday in Galicia, Madrid and Murcia in a case where two hectares of agricultural land were converted into development land to allow the Galician firm Nuaria to build 4,000 apartments after illegally paying a commission to the managers during their previous mandate.
Two other individuals have not been arrested but are under investigation, according to information from the First Court of Totana.
The first six people arrested were handed over to the court.
According to official sources, former mayor of Totana Juan Morales, who is now an independent MP for the People's Party, is also under investigation.
The ex-wife, who owns a registered real estate agency in Totana, is also under investigation, as is the current girlfriend of the former mayor, who lives in the provincial center of Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, Manuel N.A, a lawyer and entrepreneur, was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), together with the director of the firm Suelo de Inmonuar, Pablo José M.G., which is also part of the Nuaria Group and through which the bribery was carried out.
The investigation is being carried out by the Crime Unit of the Police Operational Central Unit at the Municipal level, whose members have carried out, in addition to the arrests, eleven house searches, mainly at companies related to the arrested persons, which operate in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
In Totana, only one person was arrested: the owner of a well-known poultry company in the area, who could have been a go-between.
The Nuaria Group would have created the largest residential park in Totana, with 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two wellness hotels.
The company acquired 2.2 million square feet of land in Totana, which was reclassified, and the project would have doubled the population of the present 25,000-person town.
The Nuaria Group includes companies such as Autesa e Inomonuar, a real estate agent, Conycase, which manages the car parks at Coruna, Venezuela Street and Catholic Ferdinand Square in Vigobas, Hogartel, which specialises in direct marketing, and Preconiza, which sells, promotes and assembles its building elements.
Things that happen
The first.
If you agree, we'll put aside the Book of the Month for a while and see if we can acquire some philosophical knowledge and wisdom.
I'm already equipped with one.
People, life is constantly changing.
Of course, anyone can make something up.
The second.
Our correspondent in Finland found this comment in one of the largest daily newspapers in Finland: (certainly at the forefront of the PISA report on the level of education in the world), in the Helsingin Sanomat, referring to the commentary published on November 18 at the same time as the review of Blackburn's book.
"Philosophical teachings were brought to the public eye after the tragedy at Jokela High School.
The killer, a graduate student, quoted the writings of Plato and Nietzsche in his messages.
Pekka Elo, the Education Councillor in charge of teaching philosophy, demanded in the pages of the Helsingin Sanomat daily that teachers examine Plato's teachings critically, and added that knowledge of Nietzsche was not necessarily important in compulsory elementary philosophy classes in secondary schools".

One of your colleagues informs us that the Penal Code contains a provision regarding Internet downloads:
A. Downloading a piece of music is a misdemeanor punishable by six months to one year.
However, stealing a disc from a shop with a value of less than EUR 400 is an infringement (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal €1,000 in a store, theft is already a crime, but the penalty is still less than the penalty for downloading from the Internet (Article 234 of the BTW).
C. If you steal a car but return it after 40 hours, the penalty still falls below the penalty for downloading from the Internet (Article 244.1).
D. You can expect a lesser penalty for getting into a fight than for copying CDs.
If you participate in a mass brawl, you can be sentenced to three months to one year (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), but for copying a CD, you can be sentenced to six months to two years
The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 4a to amend this Regulation.
E. According to Article 184.2 of the BTK, sexual harassment at work is not as serious as downloading a DVD film.
F. The distribution of copyrighted films without the consent of the authors is punishable by a more severe penalty than the sale of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).
If my colleague is right, someone's gotten very out of control.
The fourth.
I received an article from my family doctor about a strange research entitled "Money causes brain activity, especially when others have less of it".
So the employees' feelings on payday depend on how much everyone else gets.
The experiment was conducted at the University of Bonn using magnetic resonance imaging tomography, and the results were published in the latest issue of Science.
According to study author Bernd Weber, head of the Neurocognition group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany, "the strongest activity was measured when the participant answered correctly and the other person was wrong".
The researchers found that if both participants gave the correct answer and received the same amount of money, their brain activity was moderate, but if either of them received double the amount, their brain activity was increased.
I have no idea why it took so much science to come to such a simple conclusion.
Chief Prosecutor for the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly prosecuting Balkan war criminals for eight years from the Prosecutor's Office of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, which is based in The Hague.
Her term expires at the end of the year, and Carla leaves with a slightly bitter face, as those responsible for the Srebrenica massacre, in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were massacred, that is, General Ratko Mladic and Serbian Bosnian leader Radovan Karadzic, remain at large.
Their names are on the list chosen by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach for the title of his documentary film, The List of Carla (2006, not yet released in Spain). The film follows the work of the Swiss Attorney General from Belgrade to New York as she tries to pressure the governments involved to tighten the noose around the escaping criminals.
What kind of insurance is good for me?
Motor insurance, which provides security, is a significant expense for the car owner in relation to various accidents and depends on a number of factors, such as age, gender, date of licence, marital status, type and use of the car to be insured.
Getting the car is just the first step.
In fact, choosing the right insurance is often more difficult than deciding what kind of car you want.
First, we need to understand what it is.
Motor insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insured.
This agreement takes the form of an insurance contract which states that the insurance company will assume the fixed insurance premium for compensation in the event of the accident.
The insurance premium is in practice the amount paid for the insurance, which is determined by taking into account various factors such as age, gender, date of licence, marital status, type of car to be insured, use, etc.
Insurance companies determine the insurance premium on the basis of statistics, i.e. the higher amount is paid by the person who has a higher risk of accident.
That's why people over 25 or women pay less because statistics show they're less at risk because they're more careful.
Similarly, the insurance companies have found that married people cause fewer accidents than single people.
The frequency is the key to the type of use of the car.
The more frequent the use, the greater the chance of an accident.
The insurance companies take into account a number of factors when determining the premium.
The owner must therefore do a thorough research to be able to choose the most appropriate form of insurance for his profile.
The following are the most important factors in choosing the best option to meet your insured needs and to establish an acceptable price.
When taking out an insurance policy, people under 25 have to face a number of disadvantages, such as lack of driving experience and the fact that their driving licence is not yet valid.
While it is ideal to be protected against all dangers, there are more economical solutions.
More cautious drivers can take out full insurance against the risks and the costs.
In this type of contract, the insured person pays a part of the damage.
"The amount of the premium paid by the insured depends on the premium; the higher the premium, the lower the premium", says Luis Noguera, head of First Europa, the Spanish online insurance broker.
The other option is extended third party liability insurance, where the customer insures himself against damage caused to others but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, you'll be covered against theft, fire damage and loss of the car.
A word of advice.
If you are under 25, be careful and avoid accidents if possible, as this will affect your bonus and may reduce your future payments.
The bonus is the discount given to the insurance company in relation to the basic rate.
And the penalty that is levied against the basic rate is called a malus.
'The amount of the bonus and the discount depends on the insurance company and its profits.
If the company has had a good year, it can afford to increase the bonus rate", explains Noguera.
Once the age limit of 25 years has been reached, it is easier for owners to take out adequate insurance, as the risk of accidents decreases as a result of the experience gained over the years.
We suggest you take out a full insurance policy.
"Young people are usually not yet able to apply their experience properly in an accident, even when driving", says the director of the European Insurance Company in Spain, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, when drivers have overcome the fear of beginners.
If you are already married but do not have children, it is best to take out full insurance, of course if your financial situation allows it.
Insurance companies consider couples with children to be the least risky customers, so the premium they pay is lower.
In this case, it is best to have full insurance for your own part (up to €300) or, if you have a higher bonus, to extend the insurance coverage from the third year of the vehicle to cover damage caused to others.
"They drive more comfortably, but they also have more purchasing power and can afford to have a higher self-esteem", confirms Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, we offer full insurance with a personal contribution (around EUR 150) or, if the bonus is higher, liability insurance.
Car insurance is very important not only because it protects the owner in the event of accidents, but also because it is a large expense, so it is essential to choose the right form of insurance.
Celtic are looking to score points in Milan to get into the last eight.
Milan and Celtic will be playing each other at the San Siro Stadium on Tuesday to get the points they need to win the Champions League, with the Italians leading and the Scots qualifying.
The Italians have ten points and already secured the fifth round with a draw against Portugal, while Celtic have nine points, but they need one more to avoid being overtaken by six-point Shakhtar, who will face four-point Benfica.
Group D will be played over two legs one week before the end of the sixth round as Milan are due to play in Japan for the Club World Cup, where they will attempt to fight for a place in the last 16 in the 13th semi-final.
This will bring Group D to a conclusion earlier than the others, and although the most likely result at the Giuseppe Meazza Stadium will be a draw, the two teams are looking for victory, as the Italians do not want to stay at home, and Celtic can start from a better place in the first eight.
Gordon Strachan's team will be defeated enough to qualify if Shakhtar does not win, but it is not certain, because if there is a draw, the Ukrainians will go on, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won the next match (2-0).
The Italians will try to make the night bitter for the Scots, who are looking to reach the last eight of the re-organised Champions League twice in a row, after being beaten by a goal from Kaká in the 0-0 draw after extra time (1-0) last season.
Shakhtar should be happy with a win for Rossonerik, because if they lose, Celtic will be in the last eight and stay in the UEFA.
Because Benfica, despite being in last place and having no chance of staying in the European Championship, could still take third place with a win that would allow them to play in UEFA.
20,000 people went to Vancouver to attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour.
The Spice Girls began their tour in Vancouver, Canada, performing in front of 20,000 people for the first time since their breakup in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) were announced minutes before the show at GM Place in Vancouver that the band was "in great shape".
Some 20,000 people exchanged tickets to attend the concert, which included a video of the band's history as a huge success in the 1990's.
The band's reunion and tour coincided with the release of a new album in Spain by EMI, featuring major hits and two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Five members of the Spice Girls took the stage wearing bracelets given to them by the husband of "Posh Spice", British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was also in the crowded auditorium of GM Place, although Victoria had told him not to a few days earlier.
During the performance, Victoria Beckham said that the British soccer star "has not seen our performance dress, so I'm nervous about what she will think of the performance".
'Sporty Spice', was the reason the band broke up two years after he left the band in 1998 "because the members didn't understand each other". He also appeared nervous during the press conference held two hours before the concert.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I could see that people's feelings for the Spice Girls had changed.
I thought, 'Why not? I'm glad I did,'" Chisholm said of the band that broke up nine years earlier.
The singer added that over time, "things have worked out and we love each other very much".
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed in 1998.
CTV reports that the band has arrived in Vancouver on a Virgin Airlines special.
They were waiting at the airport for a group of babysitters.
Five of them have seven children in all.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will perform in California, USA, followed by San Jose (December 4), and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
They're playing in Madrid on December 23rd.
More fears over the Russian-Ukrainian gas dispute
The gas dispute between Ukraine and Russia has been renewed, which may also affect Russian fuel to be shipped to Western Europe.
Most Russian gas exported to the European Union (EU) is transported through Ukraine and disputes between the two nations have always attracted much attention.
Kiev has stated that if Moscow raises the price of gas to be paid by the Ukrainians, they will also hit Russia with higher transit costs.
A dispute between the two countries last year led to a drop in supplies to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow concerns an attempt by the Ukrainian government and Russia's state-owned gas monopoly Gazprom to agree on the amount of gas Ukraine is to pay to Russia in 2008.
Gazprom has stated that it will have to implement a 50% increase in gas produced from neighbouring Turkmenistan compared to the 2008 price agreement with Ukraine.
According to analysts, this could mean a 40% increase in the price of Gazprom's deliveries to Ukraine.
"It is important to argue in the negotiations in accordance with one of the most important transit states for natural gas", Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinah told Reuters news agency.
'The changes in gas prices should be linked to the ongoing debate on the level of costs of transit through Ukraine (and into Western Europe).'
As a result of the last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom closed the gas pipeline to Ukraine in January 2006.
This resulted in a domino-like decrease in exports to Western Europe, which also greatly depressed prices.
One quarter of the EU's gas supply is Russian gas.
Russia has the world's largest natural gas reserves, but most of them are still unexplored.
As a result, Gazprom supplements its own gas supply with natural gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet states in Central Asia.
The NHS 'must check foreign workers'
Scottish NHS committees need to improve their control of criminal records for workers arriving from outside Europe, a watchdog said.
The proposal was made by the Auditor-General, Robert Black, following a report in Scotland linking a foreign doctor to the attack on Glasgow airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that NHS Scotland did not have accurate figures on the number of overseas employees.
However, in its report, it also pointed out key controls that were properly carried out through a sample of five health authorities.
Following the attack on Glasgow Airport, the Auditor-General checked the list of employees recruited from outside the European Economic Area.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi-born doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a jeep crashed into the main terminal of the building.
Abdullah was one of three doctors interviewed by video link at the Old Bailey in October on charges of attempted car bombings in the UK.
NHS committees should check the qualifications and work experience of their overseas staff and their availability of the necessary authorisations to work in the UK before they start their employment.
Although the Scottish Health Boards use Disclosure Scotland to verify criminal records, the Agency is not authorised to obtain information of this kind from outside the UK.
The Auditor-General's report proposed, inter alia, that the committees should introduce a Criminal Records Office guide, which would facilitate the employer's control processes with various overseas countries.
"Although evidence of such checks has been found in staff records, they are not carried out on a regular basis", the report states.
Black said that although the NHS in Scotland is performing its own pre-employment screening process at a high level, he added: 'Our report highlights areas where the system can be improved to ensure that we have up-to-date information on the number of staff coming from overseas in the NHS.'
Dr Peter Terry, President of BMA Scotland, said it was "extremely unrealistic" that pre-employment checks could be used to identify potential NHS staff who might commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report shows that the pre-employment checks currently in place are working well in NHS Scotland and the value of the proposals is not yet transparent", he added.
The Scottish Health Authority estimates that their current overseas staff, mostly doctors and nurses, is 1,161.
However, the Auditor-General pointed out that the figures are likely to be higher, partly because committees have problems identifying employees on indefinite leave.
The investigation also showed that the control procedures in place in the NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are highly coordinated.
These procedures extended to the checking of passports, work permits and documents certifying professional qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently examining the Guidelines and Guidelines for pre-employment checks for NHS staff from overseas.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: 'I am very pleased that this task has been achieved following the attack on Glasgow Airport.
He added that the Scottish Government, in cooperation with the Health Committees, would take into account the suggestions contained in the report and ensure that the updated guidance on pre-employment checks for the entire staff pool, including those from overseas, reflected best practice.
Joy Division is in the movie awards.
A biopic of the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, Control, won five awards at the British Independent Film Awards, including Best Picture.
The award was also given to Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before Curtis, and Anton Corbijn, who directed and played Toby Kebbell.
Dame Judi Dench won best actress for her thriller "Details of a Scandal".
And the Variety Award for bringing British film into the international spotlight went to Daniel Craig, who played Bond.
The awards were presented at a ceremony at the Roundhouse in London.
"Control" follows Curtis' rise to fame within Joy Division until 1980, when he committed suicide at the age of 23.
The film, which also featured The Killers, David Bowie and New Order on the soundtrack, was made in black and white and cost just £3 million to make.
Dutch photographer Corbijn - who had previously made a name for himself with the U2 "Joshua Tree" album cover - won two awards, one for best director and one for best new director.
Another winner of the ceremony focused on rock music; Julien Temple's film about Joe Strummer, the Clash singer, won the award for best documentary.
The outgoing best actor award went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as the mob boss' driver in the London thriller "Killer Promises", directed by David Cronenberg.
Ray Winstone, famous for his tough-guy roles, has been awarded the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to the British film industry.
The 50-year-old actor, whose credits include Scum, The Skyfall and Sexy Pig, is currently filming Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
It makes Winstone proud to accept the award named after his star, Harris, who died in 2002 after winning "Camelot" and "Harry Potter".
"For people like me, the door was opened by people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney", Winstone added.
"I feel very fortunate to have had the opportunity to meet Richard Harris several times.
Richard Harris' style is close to my heart, he was a great actor of his age, and I have a great respect for him".
The selection of the independent film awards, known as Bifa, is decided by a group of filmmakers, actors and festival organisers.
Bifa's supporters and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom, among others.
In Saudi Arabia, 208 people arrested for terrorism conspiracy
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants involved in terrorist cells planning an imminent attack on an oil refinery and several attacks on churchgoers and security forces.
State television from the world's largest oil exporter said one of the cells was trying to smuggle missiles.
Al-Qaeda supporters have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
According to television reports, an eight-man cell led by a foreign national is planning an attack on an oil refinery in the Eastern Province.
Following the 2006 Al-Qaeda-led attack on the world's largest oil refinery at Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia began deploying a 35,000-strong rapid reaction force to protect the facilities.
According to a report quoting the Interior Minister, 18 of those arrested belong to a cell run by an "illegal cross-border person specializing in missile launches".
The report also reported that the fighters tried to smuggle eight rounds into the kingdom.
Twenty-two of those arrested were plotting to carry out attacks on church leaders and security forces.
The government has called on church leaders to take tougher action to curb the influx of Saudis to join al-Qaeda fighters fighting against allied forces and the US-backed Shiite Muslim government, which the hardline Sunnis in Saudi Arabia consider a heretic.
Al-Qaeda fighters see a significant number of Saudi Arabian clerics as having been recruited by the authorities to support the policies of the ruling royal family.
The group's fighters, encouraged by the Saudi-born leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, who called for the targeting of the Western-friendly Saudi government, targeted foreign settlements, government buildings and energy facilities.
"Security forces have made tremendous efforts over the past... five months", a spokesman for the Interior Ministry told state television.
The arrests also led to the arrest of a 16-man "media cell" in Medina, which was aimed at spreading "takfiri thought", the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals who advocate violent action against Muslims labeled as disloyal and apostate.
The arrest also included 32 individuals accused of providing financial support to the militants.
Venus' climate may provide a glimpse into the future of Earth
Scientists yesterday concluded that Venus once provided a pleasant environment for life.
Data from a European orbiting spacecraft suggest that this planet may be a much more likely windy twin of Earth than previously thought.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to Earth.
The two planets are almost the same size and orbit similarly, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Scientists now know that billions of years ago, Venus could have had conditions very similar to Earth's and even habitable conditions.
But the explosive greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation, and the planet's slower rotation have put Venus on a different course of evolution.
Now the water has evaporated from the planet, the surface temperature is hot enough to melt lead, and hurricane-force winds and lightning storms are destroying it.
The findings of the European Space Agency's Venus Express spacecraft, based on a year's study of the planet, paint a sobering picture of how similar catastrophic climate changes could occur on Earth.
Fred Taylor, a professor in the Department of Physics at Oxford University and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "It is beginning to be understood why the climate of Venus is so different from that of Earth, even though the two planets are very similar in structure.
"Our new data have made it possible to develop a scenario of the formation of Venus billions of years ago, when it may have had habitable conditions similar to Earth.
Enriched uranium seized by police
A kilo of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The spokesman did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but stated that the material could have been sold for $1 million (£480,000).
The gates are wide open
Mitt Romney thinks it's not worthy of a presidential candidate to answer questions from a snowman.
Republican presidential candidates have agreed to participate in a YouTube-streamed debate, where ordinary voters videotape their questions and pass them on to the candidates.
None of the questions on Wednesday night, November 28th, were as ridiculous as the snowman asking Democrats about global warming in the other party's YouTube debate.
But the questions and answers this time round reflected well the position of the Republican Party as it approached next year's election.
It is not known how the production executives of CNN, which co-financed the debate, selected the YouTube clips submitted to the candidates.
The longest debate for the first half hour was on immigration.
This is one of the Republican hot spots.
CNN asked a few uncertain voters to dial a number if they heard something that was offensive to them: the mediator experienced outstanding agreement when the candidates spoke out strongly about the issue of borders.
The most intense and longest debate was between the nationally-leading Rudy Giuliani and Romney, who was leading the way in the crucial primaries in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to change the image that he has taken too lightly on the issue of illegal immigration during his tenure as mayor of New York.
He accused Romney of hiring illegal immigrants to build his house for the former Massachusetts governor.
The debate between the two became particularly heated when the respondents asked about the support of "amnesty" (which would grant permanent status and citizenship to illegal immigrants).
Some candidates with fewer votes - such as Representatives Duncan Hunter of California and Tom Tancredo of Colorado - have managed to dig deep into the issue.
And while none of them are considered to have a chance of being nominated, their staying on the race track may be explained by the fact that they started ringing the immigration bell earlier and louder than the others.
At least on the issue of immigration, there is broad agreement among the candidates: a common goal is to strengthen borders and to crack down on illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with the fear of Chinese toxic games and other concerns from the outside world, is helping to obliterate or minimize the divide between libertarians and Christian conservatives within the Republican caucus.
When other subjects came up, however, the debate turned very unpleasantly.
Giuliani was faced with the question of why he had supported gun control earlier.
John McCain and Romney were in a debate over whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
Another question asked whether candidates believed every word of the Bible.
Stumbled on this issue, Giuliani eventually stuck to the view that although he viewed his favorite book, the Bible, as a book, he might not have taken the story of Jonah and the whale literally.
Another question was whether Jesus would support capital punishment.
In response to this expectation, Iowa's current presidential candidate, Mike Huckabee, who credited his victory to steadfast Christian conservatism, said that the death penalty is painful but necessary.
When asked if Jesus would get enough support, he laughed and said that Jesus was wiser than to run for office.
The contest is still unusually open.
Huckabee's vibrant upsurge in Iowa coincides with the libertarian Ron Paul's fundraiser and the enthusiastic cheering of his Wednesday debate.
The sudden emergence of the two candidates can be explained by the fact that the two wings of the party have not yet succeeded in launching a common candidate from among the more familiar and traditional aspirants.
In 1980 and 2000, there was a candidate who unified the party, who delivered a timely and convincing victory message proclaiming America great, and who found common ground with both wings of the party.
But now the party is divided, and the consequences are unimaginable.
Work-related pain
Another chasm lies ahead of Gordon Brown; the way out remains unchanged
Compared to the British political scandals, this one doesn't seem too spicy.
No one has sold his honor, no politician has been exposed to his Paris hotel bills, no one has committed an extra-marital scandal.
But the discovery that a wealthy businessman had contributed more than £650,000 (US$1.3 million) to Britain's governing Labour Party under the name of others over four years, and that the party had not reported it, was one of the things that would have kept the circumcised Gordon Brown in line.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister got away with his election and when he recklessly questioned the intelligence of the British people by saying that polls had no bearing on the outcome of the election, people were still hoping that Brown would provide a strong and effective government.
But instead, as Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat's deputy leader, who has been making increasingly witty remarks, has noted, the once-feared Brown has transformed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The rescue of the struggling Northern Rock bank has put regulatory weaknesses and shortcomings in judgment at a crossroads.
The patient proposals to change the tax code have encouraged business interest groups to unite against the government.
The loss of personal data of 25 million people by the tax authorities revealed an unimaginable level of maladministration.
In the House of Lords, three retired generals have stirred up a row over cuts to the military budget, claiming that the position of Minister of Defence is a part-time job.
And now here are the secret donations of David Abrahams, Peter Watt, the Labour Party's general secretary (formerly administrative leader) has resigned.
These accidents don't mean Brown can't turn back on the way to the exit.
At the same time, governments can reach a point where control becomes impossible.
People do not like politicians or trust them, but when a new group comes to power, they usually suspend their distrust.
But once it becomes clear that the prime minister is unlikely to be fit to lead the way, and perhaps not to stay in office for long, the suspended mistrust ends: the civil service begins to leak, cabinet ministers begin to leak, the press looks for bad news; and the government becomes defensive and unable to concentrate.
In a sense, Brown is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he is not considered "fresh blood".
As much as he'd like to deny his connection to Tony Blair, he was his right-hand man.
For example, the problems with Northern Rock and the tax records are related to decisions made during Brown's tenure as Treasury Secretary.
And while he was not directly involved in Blair-like actions, such as his protracted investigation into the relationship between the "nobility for money" case and political party funding, voters can rightly assume otherwise.
Although Brown's situation is uncomfortable, it's not as embarrassing as it seems.
The shooting is not as scary as the Tories make it out to be.
As with Mr. Bean, no one died, no one was directly involved.
And the compensation, however painful, could be the creation of the direction that Stalin in Brown has always promised: reliable, solid and somewhat tough government.
A good example is the political funding scandal.
The shy Abrahams, who likened his donations to charity, said he did not want his donation to be made public.
Perhaps, but it was not his decision to make.
The law banning the anonymity of major political supporters is clear and clearly justified: the public has a right to know who is knocking at the door of the country's leaders.
Watt, who said he knew about Abrahams's move but was unaware of its illegal nature, will likely be sweated during the hearings, as will Jon Medleson, the Labour Party's foundation chairman, who learned of the disruptive donations in October.
Brown, on the other hand, is not in the loop: there is no indication that he knew about these coils, not even that the huge sums were paid after Brown took office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half his job.
Although he soon condemned the violation of the law by his party, he softened his resolve by resorting to familiar means, entrusting a committee led by a retired bishop and a judge to investigate the case for safety.
The "lesson learned" in this story is not too complicated.
In the event of a violation of the law, the police are responsible.
Brown also has other things to sort out, such as appointing the chairman of the independent committee on administrative rules that has been without a leader for six months or pushing for effective reform of political party funding.
This would require the hard-headed Labour Party to break with the Tories and the special financial ties associated with the unions - a tough sell for the party-minded Brown.
But you should face some facts about the party.
Polls show the Conservatives are now leading by a wide margin; Brown has two years to win back the voters; the only way to deliver victory is through impeccable integrity and strong competence.
Card sharks
Is the secondary mortgage crisis threatening the American credit card market?
If blood is in the water, it's natural for sharks to appear nearby.
Now that the U.S. housing market is weakening, predators are focusing on the nation's credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts estimate that if the mortgage crisis spreads to other forms of residential credit, the credit card market could lose as much as $99 billion.
The signs of tension are clearly visible.
The write-down rate for the percentage of non-recoverable loans and the default rate for the percentage of late payments exceeding 30 days have both increased.
HSBC reported a $1.4 billion loss in its U.S. consumer finance segment last month, in part due to the financial weakness of cardholders.
But it's too early to panic.
The ratio of write-offs and late payments remains low.
The third-quarter default rate of 3,89% by Moody's is one full percentage point below the historical average.
The decrease in rates is partly explained by technical factors.
The 2005 amendment to the US rules on individual insolvency resulted in a sudden decrease in the number of insolvency filings, but also in a large loss in the credit card market; the number of insolvency claims (and thus the write-down rate) is expected to increase again, irrespective of whether the conditions for borrowing are deteriorating overall.
The payment rate, which reflects the monthly repayment rate of consumers, is also solid in the market.
In addition, confidence in credit card securities is also quite strong, despite the paralysis in other areas of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup estimates that 2007 emissions will be 25% higher than last year.
The impact of the mortgage crisis on the credit card market is clear: consumers are increasing their credit card debt to pay off their housing loans.
However, card issuers are primarily concerned with cash flows and not asset values, so a fall in housing prices does not necessarily change the creditworthiness of borrowers.
The situation may even be advantageous for the creditors.
If the property is worth less than the mortgage value, consumers have less incentive to repay the loan, and as a result, repayment of credit card debt is given a higher priority.
By changing interest rates or credit limits, card issuers can also adapt to changing conditions more quickly and flexibly than mortgage lenders.
In theory, this should reduce the risk of sudden revaluation of assets.
"It's unlikely that we'll wake up one day and completely reevaluate credit", says Gary Perlin, chief financial officer at Capital One.
If a subprime crisis is less likely in the credit card market, the risk of a gradual recession is much greater.
If falling housing prices and a credit crunch plunge America into recession, the industry is certainly looking to a bleak future.
Those predatory creatures are worth watching.
British bankers plead guilty to Enron
Three British bankers who were brought to trial on Wednesday for their role in a fraud involving the name of former Enron chief financial officer Andrew Faston have pleaded guilty.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew initially pleaded not guilty to seven counts of fraud, alleging that they collaborated with Fastow in a secret fraud committed in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
Their trial began in January.
But at a court hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein, Jr., they all pleaded guilty to one count of fraud.
Three former employees of the Greenwich NatWest branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group have become known in the UK during a two-year extradition procedure.
The investigation into the Enron collapse in 2001 is still pending in the United States.
The first indictment against them in 2002 alerted Fastow to being one of the targets of a government investigation into the Enron bankruptcy.
The three brokers dubbed the "NatWest Triplets" were allegedly traveled to Houston in 2000 to prepare the fraud, along with Fastow and Michael Kopper, Fastow's right-hand man at the time.
Fastow, responsible for the numerous fraud schemes that bankrupted Enron, also controlled the Enron subsidiary in which Greenwich NatWest invested.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank was not aware of any existing shareholding in the subsidiary, but the three British men were well aware of the very high level of interest.
A company run by Kopper bought the bank's $1 million stake in the subsidiary.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 to get a stake in this company.
The indictment alleges that Fastow falsely informed Enron that the energy company was buying a $20 million stake in a subsidiary of Greenwich NatWest.
But in reality, the $20 million was a hit on British bankers, Fastow and others.
Prosecution says the bankers got $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others got $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud for his role in the collapse of Enron.
The British three were arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Copper is serving three years and one month in a Texas state prison.
The three Englishmen were each granted bail of $1 million to travel to the United States, where they will remain for the duration of the trial.
Enron, the seventh-largest American company ever, filed for bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks failed to cover up millions of debts and profitable but actually loss-making businesses.
The collapse has caused thousands of jobs to be lost, the market value of the company to be over $60 billion, and the value of pension funds to be over $2 billion.
Kenneth Lay, the founder of Enron and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their complicity in the company's bankruptcy.
Skilling is currently serving his sentence of over 24 years.
The charges of conspiracy, fraud and other charges against Lay were dropped after his death last year.
There is no poverty in Moscow
It starts at $54 million on a Rolls-Royce-powered Gulfstream G550 aircraft that will fly non-stop between Moscow and Los Angeles with one tank.
But for some rich Russians, this amount is just a small coin.
"It can hold 18 passengers", said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But nobody orders that many seats because the machines are bought for private families or corporate executives".
Mr. Firer was expecting visitors to the four-day exclusive Millionaire's Market, which was held in a huge exhibition hall on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury goods carriers rented booths at the show, hoping to attract Russian newcomers to everything from mahogany-lined yachts to diamond-lined 50-cent refrigerated grilles.
Mr. Firer was watching carefully the bright orange Porsche on display at the booth next to him.
"It's a nice car, but it's not going to match our products", he said.
"The largest private jet market after the United States is in Russia".
It seems the Russian capital is floating in cash, just like Dallas did in its heyday, during the oil boom.
"We went through a similar process in the 1890's when some American millionaires went to Europe, where they were considered wealthy", said Marshall Goldman, senior fellow at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi gamblers of the 1970s and the Japanese gamblers of the 1990s, the Russians have now emerged as the world's most spectacular spenders.
The most exclusive luxury brands are demanding their share of the gold rush.
At another Moscow conference organised by the luxury industry, Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, Chairman of LVMH, shared their views on how to sell high-value products in markets like Russia.
(The conference was organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times.)
According to Forbes' list of the world's richest people, Russia is home to 53 billionaires with a combined fortune of $282 billion.
Moreover, the number of second-class Russian millionaires reaches 103,000, who can own a total of $670 billion, according to a study by economists at the Economic and Financial Research Center, which analyzes personal well-being in the former Soviet Union.
(According to World Bank data, in 2005 Russia had 15.8 percent of the population living below the minimum.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, and that's why we're all here", said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative for David Morris jewelry store in London.
Nicole first attended the fair with the brand's Russian distributor, Soho Jewelry Group.
"Women are all impeccably treated, and men are a real treasure trove".
Floating around the halls Sunday night in evening gowns, two real estate agents, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatova and 26-year-old Svetlana Turovtsova, both claimed to be millionaires and to have clients.
"I've been looking at cars and trying to decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche", said the young Yumatova, who was in a rush of a twist in her custom-designed dress, as if she was used to the excitement.
The fair was primarily geared towards the newly rich, those brand-oriented Russian buyers who are willing to walk around a sprawling, digitally decorated venue after hours of traffic, where they can find Cadillac Escaleds, platinum pockets, Mövenpick ice cream, regular pool tables, Dubai apartments and Gund furry macks.
For the average person, the entrance fee is 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians like to know which brands are the most expensive and the best", said Mr. Gijrath, who sat with a patriotic gaze at the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft's booth, opposite a wall-sized, hand-decorated, blue-checkered Rembrandt.
"The Russians are more interested in the obvious".
Indeed, the sellers here said that for a long time (by Russian standards, that's 10-15 years) rich Russians have been pushing for something from the garish logos to the trivial, limited-edition brands that wouldn't make it to a trade fair.
Yet, thousands of people, including millionaires, millionaire agents, and tourists, filled the hall every day.
And some of them bought it.
On the first day of the show, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the director of King Koil, a bed company, said that he sold two mattresses made of silk, cashmere and cotton, each worth $70,000, and that they were embroidered with gold thread.
Also on the evening of the first day, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales associate for A1 Moto, which provides high-end cars with modern alarm systems, reported that his company sold a bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
Andrei Karapetian, president of the custom-built luxury car company L.A. Connection, sold three grids for Rolls-Royce Phantoms on Sunday afternoon, which are similar to chain linkers and cost $55,000 each.
He also showed reporters a wheel made for a Russian casino owner, which he said he had inserted with Swarovski crystals to make it look like a roulette wheel.
The price of a four-piece set is $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich-skin wheels and a picture of his wife's face made of a zirconia block will not necessarily use these items", said Karapetian.
"Instead, he'll keep them in a garage that holds 30-40 cars".
Although many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Karapetian says the term "Russian millionaire" is not a big deal these days, given the skyrocketing real estate prices there.
"Anyone who bought a property in Moscow four or five years ago is likely to be a millionaire today, if not in money, but at least on paper", he said.
"There are more than you think".
Those who are not millionaires, at least they can make a show of wealth in front of the booth of the Russian wealth management company Alliance Continental.
The company built four English-style phone booths, which were piled with millions of counterfeit dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, told me that his team printed 500,000 fake bills for the Millionaire's Market.
Many of the visitors stopped to play with their money, taking pictures with their mobile phones of themselves with piles of money or just pocketing a few million.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire", said Karryev.
Surgical error is suspected behind a fatal accident in New Jersey.
The day before Thanksgiving, Ronald Livingston looked out the window of the restaurant called "Just a Little Healthier" and saw an ambulance stop at Cape Cod two doors down on West Scott Avenue.
A police patrol car arrived shortly after.
And then another.
"Then I saw the doctor's car stop", said Mr. Livingston, a supervisor at the restaurant.
"I knew someone had died".
Authorities have identified the 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, as a former assistant to the Newark Police Department's chief of police.
An investigation is underway to determine whether the death was caused by an operation by a cosmetic surgeon working under 212 West Scott Avenue without a permit, unidentified by police.
Authorities have not been able to determine the cause of Arroya's death, but they hope that the results of toxicology tests that will be available in a few weeks will shed light on this mysterious death, which has caused great pain to the high-ranking employees of the Newark Police Department.
Arroyo, whose voice was known to many in the department, had been working as an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006.
"He was loyal, hardworking and reliable", McCarthy said of Arroyo in a telephone interview Wednesday.
He was my janitor.
He was my protector".
McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, formerly of the Newark Police Department, now of the Sexual Products Control Board, and left behind two boys, ages 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokeswoman for Union County Prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow, said investigators are working to determine whether Ms. Arroyo was the victim of an unlicensed surgeon's procedure.
"The probability is going up", Walsh said.
"The investigation is ongoing".
Authorities report that they arrived at the house around 3:00 p.m.
On the 21st, they found Mrs. Arroyo on the couch.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
It's been over a week and the police have so far told us very little about the investigation and the owner of the house, Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't say if Castro was interviewed by detectives.
The study participants are investigating whether a part of the house was used as a medical prescription.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door at Castro's home, where a rosy rose bush stood in the narrow front yard and a Dalmatian barked from the back of the house.
Next to the cellar door, in the driveway, was a blue canister with the words "Ethyl Vanillin", which is used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfume.
Hooks on two mountain bikes hanging sideways.
McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived in Newark after 25 years with the NYPD, Mrs. Arroyo was invaluable in helping him navigate the unusual and untamed political culture of the new city.
"He always said, 'You better watch out for this and that!'"
"It was always here when I arrived in the morning and always inside when I left in the evening.
It was confusing".
Expectations of Fed rate cuts lead to a crash in world stock markets
Stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic jumped yesterday after reassuring statements from the vice president of the Federal Reserve, who raised hopes that the Fed would seek to ease investment opportunities with further interest rate cuts.
Stock markets in London, New York and across Europe were in a state of shock after Donald Kohn, the right-hand man to Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, said that leaders must respond "flexibly and pragmatically" to the ongoing turmoil in financial markets.
In addition to its clear aim of calming the markets amid signs of a resurgent credit crisis, Kohn stated that the current turmoil "partly reversed the market performance achieved in late September and October".
It said that if the increased uncertainty persisted, it could increase the possibility of further tightening of credit conditions for households and companies.
The statements were interpreted by investors as the Fed's willingness to inject fresh capital into U.S. markets to stabilize credit conditions or even further interest rate cuts.
The statements have also reassured Wall Street, which has recently been hit by more bad news about the American economy, such as the record low number of U.S. home sales.
The financial uncertainty was further reinforced by the announcement by investment bank Bear Stearns that it would lay off 650 employees, or 4% of its global workforce, as part of cost reductions to offset losses in the US secondary mortgage sector.
The above measure affects a total of 20 jobs at the head office in London, which employs 1500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 331 points, 2.55 percent, and closed at 13,289.40 points, while the broader S&P 500 rose 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 index rose by 165.5 points, 2.7 per cent, and closed at 6,306.2, increasing the value of British blue-chip companies by more than £39.
The German Dax increased by 2.6%, while the French CAC40 increased by 2.3%.
The credit market turmoil re-emerged after a high-demand auction organised by the European Central Bank sold three-month maturities to European banks at a price of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
With the interbank rate, Libor, having risen steadily since 12 November to its highest level since September, at 6.59%, the Bank of England has been under increasing pressure to follow the Fed and the ECB and to release additional capital to the London money market.
In England, they're demanding a decision between Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
He gave me two dilemmas, one more complicated than the other.
Who should be the sixth place of the English team in Kandy, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And in the indirect context of the first Test against Sri Lanka, it's no less important who makes the decision.
The latter question is relevant, firstly because David Graveney, the President of the Selectors, who is temporarily in charge of this particular task, is assisting Head Coach Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughan in making the decision, and secondly because the desk drawer of England's Managing Director Hugh Morris is beginning to fill with applications for the national or at least one-off selector position.
Of the two players, the one who gets the shortest is the one who doesn't get the sixth spot, but as you know, life, and especially sports, is often unfair.
It's never easy to tell why someone reaches the top of their profession and another can't even get to the bottom, and it's often more a matter of luck than talent.
It's not just cricket that is hard to pick, often on a subjective basis.
Is it time for Bopara to step forward?
Is it fair to the Shah if this happens?
The same question could arise in other areas of life, for example, if John Edwards and "Tubby" Banerjee, two smart, highly educated, young leaders with a good knowledge of the business, were put in front of the decision-makers, with only one of them having a place.
Who can tell what level a cricketer is without being thrown into deep water in a more serious match?
Of course, data is a big factor in decision making, but opportunities are just as important.
In a team, the player must catch the captain's eye at the right moment in the cricket goal, and a batsman must be given a regular chance if he is ever to become a great player.
It's a lot more complicated to catch the scouts' eyes.
James Anderson, for example, has been a better player than others this season, but he's definitely a team member for the first Test, despite Stephen Harmison's own statement that he's in good shape and he's doing very well with the bat.
Anderson fought his way into the tour with 32 first-class wickets and 33 runs.
Chris Tremlett has only hit 29, but both have had successful moments at the highest level, and they hope to do so in the future.
Whether Shah or Bopara will play at Asgiriya Stadium, well, that will be decided based on the opinions.
It may make or break your career, but it may not have much of an impact on your future.
Four years ago, Gareth Batty of Sri Lanka played every Test and scored five tries and 40 runs, but it was the then-up-and-coming Paul Collingwood who became the outstanding and defining Test cricketer, who is perhaps still underrated today despite scoring a double century against the Australians in Australia.
It is likely that in their discussion at the Asgiriya Stanion during today's game, Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, following their conservative instincts, will vote for Shah's greater experience, versus Bopara's youthful vitality and dynamism.
Both are justified.
Shah made his brilliant and successful debut in the 88th Bombay Test quarter-final against Bopara six, who is 22 years his junior and equally good at curveball, and scored 32 first-class centuries.
But the fact that the Middlesex player Shah scored just 10 runs in two quarters in May's Test at home to the West Indies at Lord's, and the fact that his next match for the replay was met with immediate opposition from the selectors by Vaughan, seems to have reduced the stamina that was clearly evident in Bombay.
In contrast, the Essex's universal talent is a lively and unrivaled player.
Nothing on the cricket field can make you angry, but his behavior off the field was well described when he crashed a Volkswagen, the team's sponsor car, at an exhibition.
He sustained minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did after that was to pick up his Vodafone phone and call his teammate, Alastair Cook, who was watching him from a distance, and ask him, "Do you see this?"
Bopara is a classically gifted player, with his slippery middle paces forming a favorable pitching angle and his batting is confident and skillful.
It's one thing to pick the right person, and another to pick the right moment.
Maybe that's the real art of selection.
I personally would give Bopara a chance, which doesn't mean I don't think Shah would be a top performer if, as the Ceylon tea leaves suggest, he was the one playing on the weekend.
They're taking refugees home on buses to work and fight al-Qaeda.
Since yesterday, the first buses have arrived from Syria to Baghdad with Iraqi refugees who have run out of money or whose visas have expired, or who are actually hoping that the city will be restored to order.
Some of them have returned to fight the soldiers who drove them from their homes.
The bus station in Mansour was already filled with refugees returning from Syria and Jordan before a government convoy of 800 people from Damascus, packed with dozens of buses, arrived.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad", said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because I saw on TV and in the papers what happened in Baghdad and that the city is now safe.
"They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people", he added, referring to militia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who has now stopped his Shiite army.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the predominantly Sunni town of Amariyah, returned home with his two children after failing to renew his Syrian visa and the regime there preventing Iraqis from taking up work.
His neighbors from the Amariya Shia community called him and urged him to return home, saying that with the help of American-backed forces, they had managed to push al-Qaeda out of their strongholds in the western part of the capital.
One of the first to arrive from Jordan was a Sunni and Shiite tribal leader who fled a shell attack at his home in Sleikh, northern Baghdad, after he began urging his fellow citizens to fight against al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
"Two days ago, my friends called and told me that they had formed an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and needed my support and that of my sons.
That's why I came back today", said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many people have spoken of the consolidated peace in the capital since the arrival of American troops and the attraction of armed civilian forces cooperating with the Americans.
But many more were forced to return from Damascus due to visa and financial problems.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, a father of three, echoed the view widely held among refugees that Shiite Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki had asked the Syrian government to refuse the refugees' visas in order to force their return.
It is estimated that over two and a half million people have fled the country's death squads.
"Everything was fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and pressured the government to stop issuing more visas to Iraqis so that they could move back home", the Sunni pensioner said.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I escaped".
One reason for the easing of violence is that Sunnis have been driven out of Shia areas, while Shia have also left Sunni-populated areas, resulting in a reduction in tensions in many areas.
Many fear that the sudden arrival of refugees will reignite the mood, possibly leading to more fighting.
Small Saarland - training at scale
The smallest federal state is a leader in vocational training and has an international orientation in higher education.
In one area of training, rural Saar suffer from the same deficiencies as the rest of the country.
"I explained to people outside the Saarland that we are not French" for the 50th time yesterday - this is the self-deprecating slogan on the posters for the 50th anniversary of the smallest of the federal states.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play an important role in the education system of the Saarland, which is ranked fifth in the survey by the German Economic Institute (IW) in Cologne.
In this way, institutions of higher education - just because of tradition - cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
Saarbrücken University was founded by the French in 1948.
Students here can still finish their studies with a double or even a triple degree.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is high at 15.6%.
However, the Saarland's colleges and universities are also attractive to those who wish to study in the Saarland region - many of them without a high school diploma.
"The Saarland is exploiting the possibilities of vocational training", explains Axel Plünnecke, an education expert at the German Economic Institute.
More than one in five young people are eligible for further education in vocational schools, which is more than seven per cent higher than the federal average for the Saar region.
The possibilities for combining vocational and higher education are also well developed.
The infrastructure for dual studies is the second largest in Germany in terms of population.
However, despite practice-oriented training and growing interest, the number of graduate engineers has fallen by a third in recent years.
The Saar Regional Ministry of Education therefore ordered the higher education institutions to launch a marketing campaign focusing on engineering.
"We have initiated a number of reforms in primary schools since the first Pisa study", a spokesman for the education ministry said.
So the government introduced nationwide comparative tests.
To get kids into school early, the last year of kindergarten is free, and that's a model that other states have started to emulate.
Whether the performance of learners will improve in the long term will be determined by future comparative studies.
According to the 2003 Pisa survey, the proportion of students at risk has fallen from 29 percent to 20 percent.
The Saarland's overall performance, however, did not improve to the same extent as that of the other Länder.
Bavarians count better.
To the great irritation of the Saar countrymen, the Pisa survey does not take into account the knowledge of foreign languages, otherwise the area would be harvested for grain.
The language of the neighbouring countries is a compulsory subject in secondary schools, even if the people in the Saar countryside are not French.
Chavez is changing the clocks.
In Venezuela, in the near future, clocks will run differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9th, President Hugo Chávez will turn the clocks back by half an hour in this Latin American country.
Meanwhile, Chávez was a laughingstock in Spain.
According to the official Venezuelan newspaper, a new law will turn back the clock by four and a half hours from Greenwich.
In this way, the South American state will be part of a time zone that is not used in any other country in the world.
Among other reasons, Chavez's anti-U.S. decision was based on the fact that the United States imposed time zones based on the hour.
Chavez also announced on Wednesday (local time) that he was cutting off relations with neighboring Colombia over a hostage situation.
The left-wing nationalist politician has declared that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains the president of Colombia, he will not maintain any contact with the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do it for my own dignity", said Chávez, who is pushing for a constitutional reform that would see the country's citizens vote in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would significantly expand his power in the country.
The cause of the controversy was Uribe's decision to withdraw his mandate from Chávez to negotiate the release of hostages with the Colombian Marxist rebels.
Uribe's decision "spit in the face" of Venezuela, giving voice to his criticism of Chávez on Sunday.
In Spain, everyone talks about Chavez.
A new mobile phone ringing in the country has gained attention: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you shut your mouth), a phrase that has been downloaded by more than half a million people.
The phrase comes from Juan Carlos, the King of Spain, who at the last Latin American summit was so angered by the constant interjections of a left-wing populist politician that he struck at his word.
In 2007, the Germans are threatened with a fall in their wages.
A forecast threatens real wage cuts for German workers this year despite the strong economic recession.
Experts have given a host of reasons for their pessimistic forecast.
According to the Hans-Bröckler Foundation, employees can expect to receive a lower salary in 2007 than in the previous year.
"This is due to modest wage growth, an increase in the general sales tax, and rapid increases in food and energy prices", Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomic and Economic Research told Bild.
The unemployment insurance scheme may also impose additional burdens on workers.
In a statement to the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" daily, Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stated that in the current situation it is right and reasonable to reduce unemployment insurance to 3,3% at the beginning of the new year.
In any event, the German Federal Employment Agency should not be put in such a difficult position to turn to the federation for a loan or a grant, the politician of the German Social Democratic Party, the SPD, was quoted as saying.
It was announced on Tuesday that the explosion in food and mineral oil prices has resulted in the highest inflation in 13 years.
In a year-on-year comparison, prices increased by a total of 3%.
Venus is the Earth's evil twin.
Despite its rugged atmosphere, Venus is more like Earth than previously thought: In its orbit, the European spacecraft Venus Express detected lightning and at its poles, winds like those that occur on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have assumed that Venus is lightning.
The European spacecraft Venus Express has provided evidence - it detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: "Venus's lightning strikes from cloud to cloud on wheels 35 miles [56 km] high", reports Christopher Russell of the University of California, Los Angeles, in the journal Nature.
The famous "soup theory" suggests that lightning caused life on earth: Storms triggered reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so with Venus: "If life ever existed there, it must have been in very early times", explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution of Washington.
At present, there is little living on the surface of Venus: The atmosphere is 100 times denser than on Earth, and temperatures can reach 500 degrees Celsius.
"Venus may be the infernal twin of Earth, but it is a twin", Russell pointed out.
The central question of the ESA mission is why Venus, so similar in mass and size to Earth, is on a completely different evolutionary path.
The launch of the Venus Express in November 2005 was a milestone in the search for Venus, for no probe has been on the road since the early 1990's specifically to explore this planet.
The latest research, already presented in several Nature articles, is more than just proof that Venus is unique in the solar system, according to researchers.
"They also suggest that the similarity of the neighboring planet to Earth is greater than originally assumed", Esa reported.
In addition to the already known Arctic gyrosphere, researchers have discovered an even faster-moving cloud cloud at the South Pole.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of the air currents of the Earth's winter hemisphere, says a research team led by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Astrophysics and Space and Cosmic Physics.
The second innermost planet in the solar system is nearly the same mass as Earth, and at a diameter of some 12,000 miles [12,100 km], it is almost the same size as Earth.
Also called the Evening Star, it orbits the sun in just 225 days.
However, it orbits its own body much more slowly: a Venus day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus' surface temperature, at 92 bar, is barely Earthlike, scientists assume that both planets formed under very similar conditions.
Both had water accumulated, which remained as an ocean on Earth, while on Venus it left for the universe.
And while on Earth, carbon dioxide is trapped in carbonate rocks, on Venus, it makes up most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Köhler, the President of the German Republic, demands an end to the inter-party debate that erupted around his reception at the Dalai Lama's Chancellery.
He was indirectly critical of the SPD for attacking the Chancellor after the September reception.
Horst Köhler, President of the German Republic, is concerned about Germany's prestige and has called for the Grand Coalition to end the debate over the Dalai Lama's reception.
"We should not appear to the outside world as a divided nation on this issue", Köhler told Handelsblatt.
Köhler also expressed his understanding of Chancellor Angela Merkel's reception of the Dalai Lama in September.
'Human rights are universal for me, even if I respect the differences between cultures,' Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany must maintain a delicate foreign policy balance, the president stressed, but Merkel defended herself against the accusation that the chancellor would pursue a new China policy.
"The Chancellor has not broken with the traditional one China policy.
China is aware of this", Köhler pointed out.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) has indirectly expressed his displeasure at the Dalai Lama's reception and has therefore become a target of attacks within the Union.
Mr Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the EU's 'scrap policy' in the field of foreign policy.
After the Dalai Lama's reception at the Chancellery, there were violent disturbances in German-Chinese relations.
Thus, the Chinese leadership not only refused the invitation of the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also froze the so-called Strategic Dialogue between the foreign ministries of the two countries, according to SPIEGEL information.
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao has now called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit that the Dalai Lama's reception was a mistake.
China will refuse to allow European politicians to welcome the Tibetan religious leader in their official capacity, Chinese official Wen Jiabao said.
The Dalai Lama's actions and words pointed to his attempts to separate Tibet and other Tibetan territories from China, including the present-day provinces.
Schäuble is wary of riots like those in France
Street clashes with the police, gunfire, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
Everything must be done to prevent social discontent in Germany from escalating into street violence, the Federal Minister of the Interior urges.
Barricades burned, rioters fired shotguns at police: After serious riots by young people in France, Federal Minister of the Interior (CDU) Wolfgang Schäuble fears similar developments in Germany.
"We must be careful that the social explosive does not build up and turn into violence.
We have to take it seriously", he told the newspaper "Neue Presse" in Hanover.
Not all young people are adapting to the rapidly changing social reality.
The federation, the provinces and the communities are currently working intensively to resolve the problematic cases, said Schäuble.
This is not just about the integration of immigrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islamic conference, the first successes are already being seen".
But it's too soon to call an emergency.
Schäuble also pointed out that German suburbs do not have the same urban and sociological problems as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people have been fighting with police in the streets.
Cars and public buildings were burned in Toulouse.
In view of this, the head of the Turkish Communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat, called for greater action on integration by the Federal Government.
In the wake of the riots in France, Kolat warned of the "dangers of imitation".
Although the situation in Germany is not as delicate as in France,
action is needed.
Kolat pointed out that among young people under 25 years of age from immigrant families, the unemployment rate is "above average".
First of all, we need to provide more educational places.
Kolat stressed: "We need to give young people a perspective".
However, the Turkish Community leader added that "social surveillance within the family" is much more present in Germany than in France.
Moreover, many young people from immigrant families do not want to ruin what their parents have built here.
Kolat warns: "Nevertheless, we must be on guard".
For young people, "the opportunity to get a job and to get an education must be provided as soon as possible".
Meanwhile, in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, there was complete silence during the night.
Hundreds of police were on standby, a helicopter with a spotlight patrolled the area.
Authorities have reported three arrests and a few burning garbage cans and cars.
Since the report, a 1,000-man security team on wheels has been keeping the peace.
Police are ready to intervene as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburbs.
During the riots in Villiers-le-Bel on Tuesday night, 80 police officers were injured on wheels.
The next night, the riots spread to Toulouse.
The riots were sparked by a traffic accident that killed two young people on Sunday.
The state's attorney's office has made preliminary findings that the police are not responsible for the deaths of the youths.
In the realm of Angela the skyscraper
The chancellor's outspoken behaviour is evidence that the coalition is ending - and nothing is expected of him.
Which country does the Federal Chancellor live in, anyway?
After his dry, content-indifferent and meaningless speech at the Bundestag general debate, it must be stated that he does not live here - not in the country which he is supposed to govern.
He rejected the accusation with a very sobering sentence, that Angela Merkel was too focused on foreign policy.
It's provincial, he replied, and in that way he was only expressing that he didn't want to understand what those who criticized him were talking about.
At the Federal Assembly, he made it clear to everyone how fitting eye-waves are.
Meanwhile, there was no real interest or empathy for the country's problems.
Instead, Angela the Skywalker emerged: a politician who is a realist, who takes refuge in foreign policy and is also a self-serving uncertain.
Example of climate protection: He is bragging about the Heiligendam Decisions, but he is silent about how the country should achieve its climate goals.
In any case, as far as self-esteem is concerned - such a degree of modesty would not have been allowed by the CDU president two years earlier.
Now they're clinging to the phrase that prosperity has made a positive impact on people.
This is damaging to his reputation as a pragmatic person who offers solutions to problems instead of rhetoric.
But in the realm of Angela the skyscraper, domestic problems are only a side issue.
Child poverty and low-income problems?
It's worth a few half-sentences.
It's telling in this respect how often you're off the hook when it comes to family allowance.
Merkel has to click three times to make a half-to-half-hearted sentence.
When it comes to specifics, he's stumbling into foreign territory.
The Roham Division
The Republican presidential debates on YouTube have been a heated exchange of blows between the two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney - and now they have to be wary of an outsider.
The candidates' tension has already surfaced over the first topic.
Mitt Romney blames his opponent, Rudy Giuliani, for making New York City "a haven for illegal immigrants".
Contrary to serious facts, Giuliani, who says, "I would say that his own house was a haven for illegal immigrants", blames the former governor of Massachusetts for hiring undocumented immigrants as private individuals.
With the Republican camp still without a unanimously supported favorite, the eight presidential hopefuls are using the debate on CNN above all to undermine their opponent's credibility.
The 30-second videos that Internet users upload through YouTube are little more than short summaries.
"This is the kind of isolationism that brought Hitler to power", John McCain is saying to his opponent, Ron Paul, who is the only one in the circle calling for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
And let Romney wash his head thoroughly, the Vietnam veteran, when he hesitates to condemn as torture what he calls "waterboarding", the interrogation method that simulates drowning.
That the important issues of the campaign, meanwhile, go beyond the debate over Iraq and torture, is shown by the reactions of the public in St. Petersburg, Florida.
There's a great deal of applause in the room for the praise of conservative values and the rejection of future tax increases.
Meanwhile, the weaknesses of the two candidates are becoming more and more apparent.
"I was wrong then", Romney confesses, remorsefully, and apologizes to supporters and television viewers for voting against abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, however, hesitates when asked for his opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf first governs as a civilian
One day after the withdrawal of the army, the ruling party of Pakistan, Musharraf, was sworn in as president.
This ends eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was inaugurated for a new five-year term on Thursday.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live from the capital, the presidential palace in Islamabad.
Musharraf swore an oath to uphold the constitution and to act in the best interests of his people.
On Wednesday, he handed over his position as military chief to his confidant, Ashfaq Kiyan, yielding to international pressure, primarily from the United States.
After eight years of bloodless seizure of power in a military coup, the former general is now ruling for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With Musharraf's resignation as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, the West and the opposition have met a basic demand.
Another important demand is the lifting of the state of emergency declared by Musharraf on November 3.
Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum said that Musharraf will lift the state of emergency soon after his oath, fulfilling another Western demand.
The country's Supreme Court, which Musharraf installed sympathetic lawyers in early November after declaring a state of emergency, rejected all protests last week over the president's controversial re-election on October 6.
Meanwhile, in the tribal area of North Waziristan, five soldiers were killed and four others were injured in an attack on a military convoy.
According to information provided by the army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the Afghan border.
The fathers of Krautrock are back
The German supergroup of the '70s is playing again, the three members of the band Harmonia, dusting their instruments to the strength of a concert in Berlin.
The re-arrangement features a cut from their heyday, the time of "Live 1974".
They were already well known abroad at that time.
The sensation announced was embodied in the three agreed gentlemen sitting around the dinner table.
Each one has its own instrument, its own cable, and above all, its own buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63 years old, in a white shirt, sitting in the middle.
On the left, Michael Rother, who is 57 years old and considers himself young, accompanies the group with a laptop and a guitar.
From the audience's side to the right, 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius curls and concentrates on the console.
Each one makes some kind of noise, and sometimes rhythm.
And sometimes, by chance, it all comes together into traditional music.
However, this does not seem to bother the gentlemen.
It was a great thrill for the fans of the krautrock music scene to see Harmonia perform again.
What we can tell you here is that, as a result of proper investigation, the name has been passed down through the collective pop memory, but by no means has it left such a lasting imprint that we will sorely miss this band after 32 years.
But why not celebrate the living legends of the Germans of the seventies?
Especially since what we mistook for krautrock has always been valued more in England and America than in their own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Award for Lifetime Achievement to the surviving members of the Cologne Can in 2003, the German pop figures sat in the room with their faces unresolved.
When he thanked the Red Hot Chili Peppers, even La Düsseldorf and Neu! the admiration was boundless.
And then at the shows, Michael Rother would sit on stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers like an old pal.
Homegrown rejection and foreign acceptance are two sides of the same coin.
The memory is overwhelmed by Harmonia because the trio only existed for two years, and during that time had far less impact than what was later attributed to it.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously collaborated with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
They first performed in the basement of the Schaubühne Theater in Berlin.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, to a church-funded record label.
Rother briefly assisted Kraftwerk, and in parallel he made a name for himself as the guitarist of Neu!, perhaps the most radical German band at the time.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed the Cluster musicians into exile in the Weserbergland Forest.
There, in Alter Weserhof, a 16th-century Rome, they lived as communards who had fled the city.
Less ideologically than in Commune I, where Roedelius was still struggling as a babysitter.
Their lives are more of an idyllic art.
They reportedly found the Harmonia Ottenstein flag in the rubbish and gave their art a name.
Some of these things were recorded by Harmonia.
The first album is called "Musik von Harmonia" and the next one is "De Luxe".
Despite its loose and modest music, the band suffered from financial need.
The collection of roses alone did not ensure their discovery.
The CD, entitled "Live 1974", was recorded at a concert in Griessen, in front of a record crowd of just under 50, so you remember.
Harmony forcing and occasional practice was Rother's idea at the time.
For Roedelius and Moebius, this is an immoral demand.
The band announced its dissolution in 1975.
Rother ended up in esotericism and supported himself with albums like "Flaming Hearts".
Cluster was revived in the 1980s, and has since been more successful than Harmonia ever was.
The live album from Griessemi is a tribute to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His record label, Greenland, was dedicated to the preservation of krautrock as a distinctive German addition to his live music.
Neu! was performed in the same way as Roedelius' solo work.
The revival of Harmonia will take place at the House of Culture in Berlin.
Publicly funded, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope, the author of the British classic and the book "Krautrock Sampler", is also present.
Also present is the founder of Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
This roughly outlines the impact of krautrock on the pop era that followed.
In this respect, Harmony fills the void reserved for the super team.
Brian Eno's statement, with the most unusual sounds, floats in the room: "The only true music is the future".
There are pictures of the producer with Harmony in a room of a farmhouse.
Additional black-and-white photos of the wired equipment are used to build the legend.
In the lobby, three veterans are again busy improvising.
This is simply to attach microphones to the organ and drums with the intention of producing unheard of effects from the instruments by means of their own self-calibrated sound effects.
Today, electronic music seems to be electronic music.
Three, a tech-savvy whore.
All this, even the choir, doesn't change anything.
Led by Barbara Morgenstern, they cough and kiss and sing "Aaaaaaaah!" with emotion in one beautiful part.
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never about rock.
Roots were less sought in blues than in music colleges (Can), technical knowledge (Kraftwerk), or just escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
If someone here shouts "'68", you're not going all wrong, and that's why Harmonia is still not letting itself be disturbed.
Even the most obvious thing is thought through on stage.
Where does the music start and where does it end?
It can make a person nervous or it can make him feel like a passing moment of exceptional luck.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough.
The film "The Wedding" and "The Murderer's Peace" are two more films dealing with the war in the Balkans.
But none of them are convincing.
The basic idea is either too focused on the action and the shooting, or it's too emotional.
Not even Richard Gere himself can help you with that.
First, the good news: although the two war criminals, Karadzic and Mladic, are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, it is there, in the dark backdrop of the Bosnian war, that they have found the actor Richard Gere again.
We've lost sight of the most handsome man of the '80s lately, with his many good-boy-no-saying roles in emotional films about women and his many press conferences on Buddhism that have taken our spirits away from even the most romantic of them all.
And here, all of a sudden, Richard Gere is the most compelling argument for maybe watching "The Wedding".
He's a wonderful, smiling character, who basically is the same man that he portrayed as the war hero Simon Hunt, who would have been if fate and the film industry hadn't been so kind to him: a man who left his best years behind, but whose decline has preserved much of his former charm as a ruinous monument.
However, the film "The Wedding" and the German production "Mörderischer Frieden", which also began this week, continue the endless series of failed films about the Balkan war.
"Mörderischer Frieden" is a film about two German soldiers (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) in Kosovo who rescue a Serbian woman from Kosovo snipers, and one of them falls in love with her.
While it is welcome that the Serbs are not portrayed as the sole cause of all evil, the film, which carries the shallowness of television movies, is too quickly lost in the shooting and the action scenes.
It's a Cobra 11 character with war instead of highway.
On the other hand, it is precisely in the case of "Vedomedies" that it is possible to examine why not a single really good film has been made about the Balkan war.
The story of three U.S. war correspondents who set out to track down a Serbian war criminal named "Roka", with a different director, a different writer (both in Richard Shepard's personal union) in a different era might have become a new "Apocalypse Now".
In both cases, small groups cut down the forest to do what the army can't do - and both of these are crazy trips.
One of the reasons "The Wedding" failed is that he simply doesn't let Simon Hunt be the heartfelt cynic he portrays at the beginning.
No, and in the script, he even has a romantic relationship with a Muslim Bosnian woman who was later murdered.
The "Wedding" is finally over when the reporters in the last five minutes of the film, in the form of a fast-moving video, achieve what NATO, the CIA and all the other manhunters around the world have failed to do in five years: capture the war criminal and hand him over to the Mohammedan Bosniaks for just revenge.
It's so bad that one would like to go to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for the crime of the logic of cinema.
But the purpose of the film is deeply human.
He intends to make it clear that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large, and he suspects the Americans and the French (who are supposedly still exceptionally united) of not pursuing the persecution intensively enough because of their secret political agreements.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar that you're reminded of a famous Brecht verse.
In it the poet writes of the woodcuts depicting the Asian demon on his desk: "I gaze with interest at the glittering vein in his tail, which tells me how tiring it is to be bad".
Movies like "The Wedding" have the same oversized, human-headed masks, but they show how tiring it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the genre of films about the Balkan war.
It was recently reported in the newspaper that all Hollywood movies about Iraq were a disgraceful failure.
We can add that there has not been a single good film about South Africa.
It's almost always true: if a star wanders through the world's crisis zones or minefields, it's like "The Paths of Freedom" with Patricia Arquette, "Without Borders" with Angelina Jolie, or "Bloody Diamond" with Leonardo Di Caprio.
It's possible that these conflicts are simply too close in time.
It took them decades to make a good Hollywood film about the Holocaust, Schindler's List.
Probably some films will fit in - because the now-classic Vietnam War films like "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now", or "Full Metal Jacket" were not universally celebrated as masterpieces in their time.
But you can imagine that nowadays, when every mass murder is coming to our homes in real time, right through two screens, we simply know too much about the conflicts of the world.
And that deprives writers of the ignorance of reality that is needed to tell good stories.
After all, "To Be or Not to Be" and "The Dictator" were so successful because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how terrible the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you shouldn't try to be good if you want to make a good movie.
Perhaps we should settle for the novelist Lawrence Norfolk's sarcastically distant artistic vision.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel The Lemprière Lexicon and the Balkan War, he replied: "It's just that some things never change.
The big cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way, and Yugoslavia will always be at war".
Von Beust is being heavily criticized for his cancellation of the Olympics
The mayor's departure from his bid for the Summer Olympics in Hamburg has drawn fierce criticism from the political and economic world.
Many want to continue the fight for the water games.
But in the process of risk-taking, von Beus is strongly warned of the realities.
On Wednesday, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, the chief executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, described the withdrawal as "unfavourable to the economic environment".
No other project has unleashed such powerful motivational forces in the city lately as the Olympic idea.
"Without this objective, we could not maintain a steady momentum in sports policy".
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project but to develop a long-term initiative "based on modified time coordinates".
Mayor Ole von Beust has repeatedly stated in the past that his ambitions for the Olympic Games in Hamburg are unrealistic until at least 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on the Olympic bid, but the German Olympic Sports Federation", von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
Reference to the decision of the Sports Federation expected in early December on the Munich bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics.
"To give it priority means that we will not have a realistic chance in the period up to 2028 that we have envisaged".
Nevertheless, we do not give up the dream, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) has expressed its regret at von Beust's comments.
This gives the impression that Hamburg has no intention of bidding for the Olympic Games for the next 25 years.
"It is too early to waste an opportunity by burying our plans now", said Günter Plos, president of HSB, on Wednesday.
The withdrawal from the tender is also contrary to the statement made by the President of the Senate at a reception held at the General Assembly of the German University Sports Association.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the compatibility of the aid to the Region.
The College Sports Council only last week launched Hamburg as the city in the bidding.
The SPD's civic group has complained to the Senate that it has wasted valuable time on the housing project in Hamburg.
"The development of Kleiner Grasbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it voted in favour of the Olympics and ignored the housing project", said two SPD representatives, Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has consistently advocated an integrated plan for the Olympic and later residential use of Kleiner Grasbrook, the CDU has unilaterally emphasised the 'event factor'.
The bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics was a big deal in Hamburg at the time.
However, Hamburg failed at Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
If you think of Sweden and your village, you're thinking of Ikea, not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
At present, Swedish-made faucets cast a dark shadow on Warhol's list of works.
Most of the 94 'Stockholm type' Brillo Boxes listed here are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper Expressen questioned the authenticity of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo Boxes a few months ago, an internal investigation by the Moderna Museet in Stockholm has now yielded a sobering result: six copies of the "Brillo Box" donated to Moderna Museet in 1995 by Pontus Hultén, a former museum director - and, most likely, many of the hundreds of other "Stockholm-style" Brillo Boxes on the international art market.
The prehistory is a long and complicated chain of artistic and curatorial displays.
Warhol created the first "Brillo Boxes" in New York City in 1964, painted boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the "Brillo" soap powder carton.
At a 1968 exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet, hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard were displayed with Warhol's permission: These were not from Warhol (for cost-saving reasons) but shipped directly from the Brillo carton factory.
They were not works of art, but their templates, simple exhibits.
However, in 1968 Warhol authorized the manufacture of some Brillo-falladium in Sweden, but these were not exhibited at the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time now speak of fifteen boxes in a row which, certified at the time as Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Box under the designation 'Stockholm type', have rightfully entered the history of art and auction.
Some of them sold for over $100,000.
The problem, however, is that Pontus Hultén, the legendary museum director, later falsely claimed that in 1968 a hundred wheelbarrows were made and exhibited in Sweden, which he then left to Warhol.
In fact, Hultén's box 105 was only made in 1990 in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
In addition to the six Brillo Boxes owned by the museum, Lars Byström, chief curator of the Moderna Museet, examined three private boxes in Sweden, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: The pressed sheets were first grounded and polished, then brushed with white oil paint.
However, the structure of the 1990 copies indicates that the paint was applied directly to the rolling plate with a paint roller without a base - and it is not oil paint, but acrylic paint.
"These boxes were not authenticated by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol Brillo Boxes", says Lars Nittve, director of Moderna Museet: "Unless the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York decides otherwise, Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibits".
The Authentication Board, of course, announced back in June that it was investigating "serious allegations" about soap cans.
But since then, they have been shrouded in implacable silence.
Manila rebel soldiers give up
The uprising in the Philippines was sparked by soldiers barricaded in a hotel in Manila, demanding the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He can't take responsibility for the bloodshed, told reporters his hotel manager, Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and electoral fraud.
Before that, the hotel was raided by tear gas-laden soldiers.
Two dozen soldiers have barricaded themselves in the building for hours.
Half the team was in court Thursday for the failed coup attempt in 2003 - including Trillanes.
He used the hearing to suddenly solve a wheel with 30 sympathizers.
The military police assigned to guard the man apparently crossed over and joined the riot.
They broke into the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government units have sealed off the area of the prestigious hotel.
The president has called an emergency meeting of the security cabinet.
Security adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the military's actions.
"They've had enough of the people", said Trillanes.
"We invite people to join us".
General Danilo Lim, formerly the elite squadron commander of the Scout Rangers, stated that other units of the army wanted to join the march within a short time.
Critics of the government have called for a violent protest against the president on Friday.
His government has been plagued by corruption charges for months.
The Manila financial district was the main scene of the 2003 attempt by 200 army-backed insurgents to silence Arroyo.
The uprising was crushed after less than 24 hours when the army was reluctant to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven attempted coups in the Philippines against democratically elected governments.
United Internet will be a major shareholder in Versatel
United Internet has acquired a stake of more than 20% in the telecommunications company Versatel.
As reported by the company on Wednesday night, the average price per share is 14.46 euros.
This represents a 20.05% ownership of the share capital.
There's been speculation about the takeover before this.
The possibility of raising the ownership interest acquired in Versatel shall remain open.
This move is intended to help consolidate the German DSL market, United Internet reported.
On Wednesday, speculation had already emerged about a possible connection, after Berenberg Bank increased its stake in the Düsseldorf network operator by a further 5% to 15.1%.
The financial institution holds the shares only to a third party, it is reported in the financial market.
The day before, United Internet had a mere 10 percent stake in the Drillisch cell phone company.
In the framework of the capital increase, Drillisch has issued 17,4 million new shares worth EUR 106,4 million.
Of these, United Internet purchased 5,15 million shares for EUR 31,4 million.
In addition, the companies have initiated a dialogue on cooperation in the marketing of DSL and mobile phone products.
"We are strengthening our partnership", a United-Internet spokesman said.
The two companies jointly established the joint venture MSP to take over the competitor Freenet.
The two companies are initially content with a good 10 percent stake in Freenet and do not exercise the right to take over an additional 18.49 percent of Freenet, United Internet reported on Thursday.
However, the two companies are leaving all options open, in particular to increase their stake in Freenet AG, the report says.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on the strategic partnership were concluded in mid-November.
The months-long, and now only a matter-of-fact, poker game around Freenet is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2,9 million contract mobile phone customers and 1,27 million DSL and wired customers.
The holding company formed by United Internet and Drillisch has previously held a direct 6,01% stake in Freenet.
Now, it's agreed that Drillisch will bring in another four percent.
The agreement on the right to purchase 18.49% of Vatas Investment Company was signed in August.
