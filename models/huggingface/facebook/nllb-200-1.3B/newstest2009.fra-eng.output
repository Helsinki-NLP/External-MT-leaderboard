At the end of the trading day, the Prague stock market was negative.
After Tuesday morning's fall, the Prague stock market recovered its losses.
The share trading in ČEZ reached almost half of the usual daily trading.
On Tuesday, as the market began, the Prague stock market rebounded from the previous day's fall, when it lost almost six percent.
This time, the drop is due to the fall in Wall Street stock.
The market reaction to the result of the vote in the US House of Representatives, which refused to adopt the plan to stabilise the US financial sector, is thus also perceptible here.
Shares fall in Asia
Asian stocks fell dramatically on Tuesday, although the indices managed to erase some of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng index of the Hong Kong stock exchange lost four percent during trading, but later it erased some of the losses and reduced the decline to nearly 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index following the Chinese stock market movement on the Hong Kong stock exchange lost 3.8 percent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
The Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but eventually the losses were reduced to 4.3 percent.
According to his index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 percent.
"The hesitation about the US bailout will affect financial markets around the world", observed Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong monetary office.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it sets its own monetary policy, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, the US legislature should resume negotiations and pass the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, other countries could be affected.
The bloodbath of American stocks
On Monday, the US House of Representatives rejected the plan to support the financial system, which it was supposed to spend up to $700 billion (nearly $12 trillion).
The lawmakers rejected President George Bush's call for support for the project.
According to Bush, the project should solve the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the economy as a whole.
The US stock market was in a bloodbath on Monday, with major stock indices experiencing the biggest drop in 20 years.
The Dow Jones index lost nearly seven percent, having last seen a fall of this magnitude in 1987.
The index was already losing during the vote, but when it became clear that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall.
Congress gives in: US government can inject $700 billion into banks
The leaders of the US Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of financial aid agreement to the US financial system.
It will be put to a vote early next week.
The U.S. legislature made a decisive turn in the negotiations for a $700 billion bailout of the U.S. financial system.
But success is not guaranteed.
Indeed, before they can publish the final version of the law and put it to a vote, Congressmen must finalize a number of details of the agreement.
The financial support plan will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
Says Barney Frank, chairman of the House banking and financial regulation committee.
According to sources, by Wednesday at the earliest, the plan should be put to a vote in the Senate.
According to economists, the announcement of the adoption of the bailout plan should be a major first psychological factor in reviving financial markets.
Given the complexity of the mechanisms by which aid to markets can be effective, a 'disillusionment' will follow.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have settled our differences about what the market stabilization package should look like", Democratic Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
She said the final vote could be held as early as Sunday.
On the night of Saturday to Sunday, representatives of the legislature met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to finalize the government's foundation.
The Commission is expected to buy back from financial corporations the unsold real estate assets which are causing financial corporations considerable losses and threatening the stability of the system as a whole.
"We are about to agree on a plan that will work and must also be effective in the market.
This market recovery plan still needs to be continued, but I think we are on the right track", says Paulson.
A signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has had a considerable impact on the falling stock markets.
According to Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic Party, lawmakers are working to get Congress to reach a final agreement by Sunday.
They want to calm investors before trading starts in the Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone, where the congressional decision could affect trading on Monday.
At the moment, it is impossible to say with certainty when the vote will take place in both Houses of the US Congress, nor whether the negotiations may be blocked at the last moment by some problem.
The legislators hope it will be passed in the coming days.
Nevertheless, the law will still be subject to many changes.
The total amount intended for the support of the scheme shall be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion dollars, as President George Bush wanted, must be available as soon as possible.
But if Congress feels that the program is not doing its job, it has the option of blocking the remaining amount in two stages: first, an additional $100 billion, and then, finally, $350 billion.
Mr Bush welcomed the progress made in the negotiations
While the president can veto this decision, Congress has the option of voting against it.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which was to obtain financing for the purchase of bad real estate, whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
"All the work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday", said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
President Bush himself is pleased with the progress made in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said that Mr. Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the bipartisan effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Restriction of gold parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, says lawmakers have agreed on financial program accountability, taxpayer protection from losses, the deduction agreement, the timing of the plan.
The new law also provides for a limitation of the golden parachutes for directors of participating companies and establishes a committee to oversee the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this issue and have made significant progress towards an agreement that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans", Paulson said.
The plan also provides for assistance for property owners, who have problems paying.
The government should negotiate new mortgage payments for repurchase, while reducing the monthly payments to the debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
According to the chief economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its implementation will be very difficult.
"And this is because we don't know what the mechanism and price of buying back the troubled assets will be.
This will be a decisive point in deciding on the division of losses between the financial sector and the government", Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan is adopted now or early next week is not, according to Marek, that important.
"It is far more important that the congressmen agree, this week, that they support this plan and that they will enact it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, which provides for the adoption of the plan, is the most important at the moment", Marek stressed.
A fight that has gone to extremes: MP3 players versus mobile phones.
We'll give you advice on how to choose.
While virtually every mobile phone can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can make a phone call.
It seems clear that it is better to buy only a phone.
Nevertheless, there are plenty of reasons to get a self-reader.
The choice depends entirely on the method of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy a high-end gramophone for the house to play the new album of Maxim Turbulenc.
First, such music products are not released on vinyl, and, from a quality point of view, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
If you have a stack of vinyl records of art rock, jazz, or blues, you are probably dreaming of such a record.
The same is true of music on the go, which is compressed music, to put it simply - MP3 music.
There are categories according to price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, just as a Pink Floyd fan would have difficulty in buying headphones for twenty crowns at the market.
There are two extremes, and there's enough room for everyone in between.
There's a lot to choose from.
Battery life is also crucial
Some high-end music players are capable of much more than just playing music, but these are functions that are, of course, unknown to most mobile phones.
No other device today is as universal as the telephone.
In addition to the basic functions of making phone calls and sending SMS, it is capable of reading music and films, recording them, has a camera of variable quality and can, for example, even be used for navigation.
And if you take smartphones and communicators into account, you'll have a little computer in your pocket.
Since no fridge can roast meat and no television can take pictures, we are witnessing a miracle.
The universal nature of the mobile phone is not without its drawbacks.
The more functions you use, the shorter the interval between two reloads.
And reading music is one of the most important energy drains.
Few mobile phones are capable of playing music for ten to twelve hours, but in most cases this figure is much lower.
In this respect, music players (especially the more rudimentary ones) are much better.
If you have a cheap phone, you can expect it to play music for only a few hours.
If you do call occasionally, make sure you have a second charger for work - even for more expensive devices.
This will not be a problem for MP3 players, which are capable of continuous operation for at least 9 hours after recharging, including those with lower performance.
Another problem arises when recording music on the mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have a universal USB connector, especially since not all can be directly connected to the computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly onto the memory card, but few card readers know how to do so without a discount, given the tiny dimensions of the memory cards used in mobile phones.
As for the players, you don't need any software, except for the iPod.
All you have to do is fill the music device from the computer through the USB connector.
Most mobile phones and players will create a media library themselves, sorted by the artist's name, the album title, the style, or the user's judgment.
Some devices display only an index with a tree structure, like Windows Explorer, others are capable of both (river, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Readers are easier to manipulate, mobile has more know-how
When choosing a concrete device, pay particular attention to the battery life, the memory capacity, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the ease of control.
If music is for you, essentially, background noise and if you are going to listen to it for a limited time during the day, for example while taking the tram, you can use any mobile phone that plays MP3s.
Almost every mobile phone today is capable of this.
You don't even have to pay too much attention to what music formats your phone or player is capable of playing.
They can all read MP3s, and the vast majority of the music that's going to come to you will be in that format.
It is one of the most common formats and apart from it, the vast majority of devices also play WMA music.
AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPods) is less common.
High-end mobile phones also allow, for example, the purchase of music online.
All you have to do is visit the corresponding operator's (or another provider's) web pages from your mobile phone and buy the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a compelling reason for obtaining a musical motive.
Unfortunately, the supply of operators is poor and is limited, in most cases, to rapidly manufactured radio tubes.
The prices are not the lowest either.
However, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (whether via GSM, internet or even wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their motive with them.
Every time you want to listen to something, you just take your phone out of your pocket, and you forgot your MP3 player at home.
It is also important if you always have headphones or a hands-free with a connection.
If not, you can use the built-in speakers, which are available on almost all mobile phones, but with a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of musical motifs is their price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand.
For a price of three or four thousand crowns, you can get a walkman that's already very decent.
However, in most cases you will be limited by the lack of an outlet for ordinary headphones.
The price of the best phones and the best equipped ones, which also have an input for ordinary headphones, does not exceed fifteen thousand.
The readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of having an easy order.
Anyone can order the most basic readers - which do not necessarily correspond to the cheapest (see our selection).
The control is a minimum of functions; and the similarity of the control to that of a cassette player, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a randomly plugged mobile internet, followed by a huge data transmission bill.
What to choose
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (M2, microSD, and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
The basic models in principle only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive ones can even get away with 8GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile and you still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or a Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you should not spend more than 1 100 kroner.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, choose rather specialized walkman mobiles (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent MP3 control keys, and thus the ease of control is close to that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose walkman series phones have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one that has gone the farthest in this area.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (normally 15 hours, up to 35 hours), is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the brands mentioned above.
The first virtual operator will enter the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe I should.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced, with our operators offering virtually the same services as their Western European partners.
But we are still lacking something - a virtual operator, which would force the traditional operators to lower prices.
He may not be gone for long.
We have already mentioned many times on Mobil.cz that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
The Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ) confirmed that the price of an SMS was higher in the Czech Republic than in the rest of the EU.
The latest steps taken by the European Commission in the area of roaming charges are likely to lead to a paradoxical situation: SMS messages sent from abroad will be cheaper for some customers of the Czech mobile operators than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that would really want to get into the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, given that we still have three mobile networks and a penetration that is well over 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this regard, Pavel Dvořák, the Chairman of the Board of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ), who has repeatedly stated that there is no room in the Czech Republic for another operator, is in chorus with the operators.
It is probably true that a conventional operator with its own network is apparently out of luck (and, moreover, it would now have difficulty finding frequencies).
There is another possibility - a virtual operator.
It was the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that led to a considerable price drop, to which the traditional operators also had to react.
Yet even before the advent of such disruptors as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile, voices similar to those we hear today were heard in Britain.
However, it became apparent that there was still room for such operators and that they could be really successful.
We do not have to look too far to find examples.
In February we informed you of the launch in Poland of the Mobilking virtual operator.
In just six months, the operator managed to gain over 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the country.
The Mobilking is backed by the Penta financial group, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is that they can focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to operate efficiently, they need far fewer customers than a conventional operator.
They are exempt from the relatively high costs of building, operating and maintaining the mobile network.
Thus, in the world, virtual operators are positioning themselves as low-cost operators - offering cheap calls and SMS, which is often offset by a limited range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Britain offers text messages at least twice as cheap as its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, betting on an unusual target group can also be a good advertising move.
This operator is specifically targeted at men.
"Real men choose Mobilking - a carrier they like and can trust", says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which operates this virtual carrier.
It is difficult to say whether such a concept would be likely to work here too.
Miroslav Čepický, spokesman for Vodafone, doubts: 'The Czech market is relatively small for a segment approach, which is the basis for most virtual operators.
This is especially true since it is relatively saturated in terms of service supply".
Czech mobile operators say no chance
It seems almost certain, however, that if there is a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations are not very promising.
Mobilking will be launched in other countries in our area", said Jana Studničková, spokeswoman for the financial group Penta, in a telephone interview with Mobil.cz.
It thus indirectly confirmed that operators in the Czech Republic were in any event not in favour of this idea.
Rather, they try to do everything possible to prevent a potential competitor from appearing.
GTS Novera, which would like to take a further step in order to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the field of business customers, has not been hiding its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator for quite some time.
"We are very keen to be able to offer our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have already held negotiations on this possibility on several occasions with all Czech mobile operators.
With some, we have managed to make progress in the negotiations", says group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
So the future may be bright.
From unofficial reports, it seems that we may be able to welcome the first virtual operator as early as the end of the year.
But for now, his creation is accompanied by total silence.
'At the moment we do not believe that there is room on the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is very specific compared to other markets.
At the moment, no one with a complex and serious project in this area has contacted us", said Vlastimil Sršeň of the press department of Telefonika O2, in his statement to Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová says in a rare agreement with O2's statement: "We have not yet registered a viable and bilaterally beneficial project that could serve as a basis".
She adds: 'It is virtually impossible for a virtual carrier to appear on T-Mobile's network by the end of the year.
To operate in such a short time, we should have a concrete agreement now.'
Vodafone is instead focusing on fulfilling requests for its own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepický said in this regard: 'We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of shared costs and infrastructure.
This is what we think is the most important input from the customer's point of view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to set up a common network for fast mobile internet".
Responsible authorities: in sync with operators
The approach of mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to a decrease in prices and thus to a decrease in their profit.
What good is it to facilitate the advent of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, operators are as good as thieves at a fair, as the rioting that accompanied the creation of U:fon.
The biggest pressure on ČTÚ, when U:fon was created, was the pressure exerted by T-Mobile.
This is shown by publicly available information from the ČTÚ website.
Today, however, U:fon is used as an argument against accepting a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová commented: 'Competition in the mobile market has also recently been intensified by the entry of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the nature of the mobile RT market, it is clear that the entry of an additional player would place high demands on the market, and especially on its services.'
But given the attitude of mobile operators as follows, the indifference of the Czech regulatory bodies seems to be disconcerting.
This is not just the attitude of the ČTÚ, which, unlike Great Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately does not have the power to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
The Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS) is the sole owner of the Office.
The Commission has adopted its typical position on this issue.
'The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator concerned concerning the lease of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been concluded at the moment, as the offer of potential interested parties has not shown sufficient interest for conventional operators", explained Kristián Chalupa of the ÚOHS External Relations Department in response to our question.
A statement thus formulated would not be surprising from operators' representatives.
But such a statement from an agency which must represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, also ensure that no one takes advantage of its position on the market is more than confusing.
The Commission has also been asked to examine the possibility of a new approach to the problem of the use of mobile telephony in the Community.
However, it is apparent that the ÚOHS has no interest in pressing for fair market operation and lower prices.
What is indeed shocking is the almost touching agreement of the three mobile operators, which emerges from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really a coincidence naturally arises.
Similarly, a price of petrol which is strictly identical at all petrol stations is probably due to chance and to the fierce competition.
'The Office has not found any evidence of anti-competitive behaviour in this respect and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position, and therefore none has a correspondingly increased responsibility for its behaviour on the market.
The telecommunications regulator probably lacks the tools needed to open up the mobile market to virtual operators", Chaloupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many points of disagreement.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets by ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications constitute, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators has a dominant position on such a market.
However, some legal experts suggest a different view of things: for the creation of a virtual operator to be possible, the consent of the network operator must be obtained at all times.
And the mobile operator has a pretty logical monopoly on its network.
Thus, it necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of its activity.
Even without accepting this argument, it should be at least worrying for the ÚOHS that three mobile operators are behaving in a similar manner.
However, the complaints of many interested parties (including GTS Novera, mentioned above) show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
The transfer of responsibility to the ČTÚ is a common communication trick, by which the ÚOHS washes its hands of the case.
We have already encountered this kind of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recent amendment to the Telecommunications Act did not include an extension of the powers of the ČTÚ in the area of economic competition in telecommunications, although many experts promised an improvement in the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS must know this, but their interests are apparently elsewhere.
When no one's watching, it can work.
However, the operation of a kind of virtual pseudo-operators, several of which operate in the Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies publishing their own price lists for mobile telephone services, but the latter are only partly public.
In most cases, this refers to firms dealing with multi-level marketing.
Specific mobile telephone services are offered by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms usually reach only elected officials.
The trick is that the company makes the operator look like a conventional business customer, who orders a large number of SIM cards.
As a major customer, she gets special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the commercial terms of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
"If what you mention happens, it could be a breach of the contractual terms that we would look into and could result in a termination of the collaboration with the company in question", Martina Kemrová replied to our question on this issue.
However, it is unlikely that such activity would not have reached the heads of mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned above, this may involve thousands of customers.
However, no operator opposes such a procedure.
The activities of these firms bring them substantial profits and, at the same time, unlike real virtual operators, they do not threaten them in any way with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický points out the possible problems: "The law allows for such speculation, but the services of these companies are used by only a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered in their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it, as ordinary mobile phone customers do".
This is precisely what should seem strange to the ČTÚ.
Furthermore, there is another question at ÚOHS.
If mobile operators turn a blind eye to such a procedure, why do they block the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the ÚOHS has relatively broad powers to disclose such activity, and if it does not wish to be satisfied with the explanations of the operators, who claim to have no idea that this would happen, their contractual terms prohibit it.
When we're not the most expensive country
As we have already mentioned on several occasions, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a considerable drop in the price of services.
In almost all countries where virtual operators were established, the traditional operators were making more or less efforts to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were virtually the same - too small or even too saturated a market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
It is precisely at this level that the regulatory bodies in the developed countries have intervened, defending not the interests of mobile operators but those of their customers.
Both through formal measures and informal pressure, they finally achieved the creation of the first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory agencies are treating this issue like a hot potato that is thrown away by passing it on to a nearby target.
In the light of our experience, we cannot shake the impression that confusion in skills is more than beneficial in these cases.
But let's not throw the handle after the hammer.
If the behind-the-scenes information is true and a virtual operator appears soon, the Czech mobile market may be back on track.
If one of the operators has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the ÚOHS will hardly be able to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And we may stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the Best
Listen to the four songs of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the occasion of the Czech National Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov můj (Where is my country?).
The anthem was again recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
We have four versions - with male or female solo singing, a choral performance and an instrumental version.
The song is performed by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The arrangements for the anthem were written by Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national anthem to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
As he had previously entrusted Český rozhlas (the Czech public radio), he chose for the interpretation of solo versions of singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"From the beginning, I tried to make sure that both singers and the choir had a good diction, so that the words were understood, that they sang simultaneously", he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov můj was first heard in 1834 on the boards of Stavovské divadlo (the Theatre of States) in Fidlovačka (Kermesse of the Savetiers), an original Czech play by Josef Kajetán Tyl, with music by František Škroup.
It became popular and people spontaneously appropriated it.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first verse naturally became an integral part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "New" Hymn Sounded
The Czech Republic's public transport authorities will introduce the chip into their ticketing system on Wednesday.
Wednesday 1 October 2008 will be recorded in the history of the Pražský Dopravní podnik (Prague Transport Agency) as the date on which the first passengers will board the metro, trams and buses, who, instead of having a paper ticket, will have an electronic coupon in their pocket.
At the moment, it is accessible to about 100,000 people who have Opencard smart cards.
Passengers can buy a 30-day or 90-day coupon (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and have it registered on their smart card at the information points and offices of the Dopravní podnik (Transport Agency), located at the Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka metro stations.
From yesterday, coupons can also be purchased online on the Dopravní podnik website: www.dpp.cz.
Over four hundred people enjoyed the service during the morning.
Those who start using the online store can forget forever about the ticket counters at the metro stations, where they have hitherto had to wait in long queues to get paper tickets.
They will buy their voucher online and it will be registered on their Opencard card in one of the thirteen Městská knihovna (municipal libraries).
"At these points, passengers have access to a ticket office with trained staff who will help them with online purchases and also record the voucher they have purchased on their card", says project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
In addition to libraries, it will also be possible to register electronic coupons on the Opencard in vending machines installed in the lobby of several metro stations.
What do these vending machines look like?
They are red, the ticket composting machines remind us, and passengers may have already noticed them at the subway stations of Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Today the city has five, but by the end of the year there should be eighty", Opatrný added.
A vending machine will check the coupon instead of the driver.
The automata that will be running tomorrow are easy to use.
Just enter the Opencard smart card and the previously purchased coupon will register itself on the card.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
The main routes to the capital are the suburban trains and the bus lines 300 to 499, which are used mainly by the inhabitants of the municipalities of Central Bohemia.
"In the integrated trains at Pražská integrovaná doprava (integrated transport in Prague), the controllers are equipped with card readers, with which they establish the temporary and zonal validity of the coupons", explained ticket controller Filip Drápal of the Ropid organisation, which designs Prague's public transport schedules.
Suburban buses are equipped with card readers integrated into the driver's trunk.
When boarding, it is therefore necessary not only to show the smart card to the driver, but also to place the Opencard at the indicated place on the side of the cash register.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the registered coupons.
"If the passenger needs to check the validity of the registered coupons, there is nothing simpler than asking the driver for this information", Drápal added.
Passengers who do not take the commuter buses and do not remember the expiry date of their voucher can re-join the ATMs, which were originally used to record vouchers on the card.
This is where the information about the validity of their document will be displayed on the device's screen.
The Sudetenlanders were calling for a referendum in the United States.
The Sudeten Germans demanded in 1945 that Šumava be integrated into the United States.
This is according to a letter deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna (South Bohemian Scientific Library).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, groups of Sudeten Germans allegedly addressed the U.S. president with such a desire.
This is one of the results of a letter kept in a private archive, which is now in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna.
The Germans from Český Krumlov in the letter pleaded with the American president not to allow "šumavská župa" (a forest region in southern Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich Agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
"We have a good understanding of the situation and want to be sure that the words proclaiming that American troops are coming to German territory are not oppressors and enemies, but liberators", reads the letter, signed "People who care about the fate of the Šumava".
Since the supposed promise of allying with Czechoslovakia - knowing the Czech national character - is nothing but brutality, ruthlessness, incomprehension, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take the Šumava protectorate into his own hands for now and forever.
"We cannot believe that you would grant this territory to a foreign state which oppresses and destroys minorities and which did nothing to help the Allied victory without considering the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants", the letter reads.
The alleged reason why the authors cannot sign the letter is fear of the desire for revenge of the "Czech oppressors".
If the US president doubted the opinion of the Germans in Šumava, he would have to organise, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to determine whether its inhabitants wanted to be part of the US, or live under US patronage.
Although the text contained in the letter may, given current knowledge of post-war history, seem somewhat naive, according to some survivors, it well illustrates the expectations of the Sudeten Germans of the time.
While the Czech Germans must have at least foreseen the possibility of being expelled from the republic, very few of them admitted such a possibility.
Some expected that the United States and Britain would give the Sudetenlanders some sort of autonomy.
Others thought that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, confirms this.
During the war, he was, as a German from České Budějovice, engaged in the navy in the Baltic countries.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and placed in the Holstein region, dozens of Czech Germans came to see him to learn Czech.
"They thought that when they returned home, the Czech language would be of benefit to them", says Chalupa.
None of the captured Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war believed that the Beneš Decrees would lead to their being expelled from the republic.
You don't think - you pay!
An emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most expensive road safety measure in Czech history.
A way of characterizing the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleš Řebíček believes that it will discourage drivers from dangerous driving behaviour.
This campaign, which cost 150 million euros, will be shown on television, radio, in films, on the Internet and in leaflets.
It should discourage speeding and drinking.
But also remind them to fasten their seat belts before starting.
The aim is to reach the consciousness of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and even professional drivers.
What's going to be in the commercials?
Especially personal stories that will attack the emotions.
This is also reflected in the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The phrase "You don't think" is capitalized on the license plate.
Then, in a pool of blood, there's the phrase "You'll pay".
Which must symbolize that one can pay for one moment of inattention with one's life.
The ads will haunt the audience until 2010.
The Ministry has taken inspiration from similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where it is common to see images with dramatic images of accident victims.
He believes that this will lead to a reduction in the number of accidents and fatalities on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
The sugar and whip strategy against drivers
"What works with drivers is the sugar and whipping system.
For example, sugar is represented by saving time by roasting on a red fire.
Whip is the threat of a fine or an accident.
The risks must be reminded of the drivers", says Martin Kořán, transport psychologist at the Na Homolce Hospital.
This is why we need press campaigns and, above all, negative advertising, says the psychologist.
He said that the signs warning drivers of danger are already less effective.
"When a static warning sign is installed, it will probably quickly merge with the environment and drivers will not notice it", said Kořán.
Olmert would give up almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace.
Ehud Olmert, the president of the Israeli provisional government, spoke in favour of the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published by the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper on Monday.
"We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all the (occupied) territories, if not all", Olmert told the daily.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of Israeli territory), since without that, peace will not be made", he added.
He admits that the possible restitution would include East Jerusalem.
"Anyone who wants security in Jerusalem, and especially does not want to be crushed by tractors and bulldozers, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem", Olmert said, referring to the two attacks in the city in July that killed several people and injured dozens.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historic places" located inside the Old City.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It will not work", he later stressed.
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke in favour of Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he considered an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I am not proposing to conclude peace with Syria on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan", he said.
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relations with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah (the Shiite movement); they will have to give up their constant support for the terrorism of Hamas (the Shiite movement), Al-Qaeda (the terrorist network), as well as the jihad (holy war) in Iraq", the Prime Minister said.
Questions that arise after the accident: Are stewards on the bus illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long-distance bus is prohibited
In the context of the tragic accident of the Student Agency coach near Padua, Italy, the question arises whether the stewards and passengers can move around inside the coach during the journey.
"If the law is strictly and formally observed, the activity of a steward is contrary to the traffic law", says transportation ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in question, in which a 22-year-old hostess died, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck crossing the bus' path.
The girl was sadly sitting next to the driver, in the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she had two other seats at her disposal.
The bus may have an accident or even brake abruptly, even while the steward is serving coffee or distributing newspapers.
What matters is whether the coach is equipped with standing seats or not.
If this standing equipment is not approved, passengers must remain seated.
The long-distance buses of the Student Agency do not have standing places; this was confirmed to Aktuálně.cz by the company's director Radim Jančura.
"We have discussed this with the ministry and at first they prohibited all travel by passengers.
Then they cancelled it and we got passengers to go to the toilet during the journey provided they have their own seat", he revealed his position.
The law ignores the steward
"There is no single legal interpretation of the steward's role - no legal prescription deals with this role.
Moreover, no legal requirement prevents the carrier from offering services.
The road transport law only knows the term 'vehicle receiver'; it does not define his rights and duties,' adds Hanzelka, spokesman for the company.
Josef Pokorný, director of the Department of Road Traffic, believes, on the contrary, that the law deals sufficiently with the problem.
"It all depends on whether the bus has a permit to offer standing seats.
It's all in that", he says.
Buses are divided into urban, where there are standing places and a limited maximum speed, intercity with standing places and a higher permitted speed and long distance buses without standing place with the highest permitted maximum speed and seats fitted with seat belts.
Like on a plane, says an expert
Jaroslav Hořín, an expert in road safety at BESIP, does not see the shifting of stewards on board as a major problem.
"There is no danger in regular traffic, which can be compared to the situation in air traffic control.
There, too, it is not certain when turbulence will occur and the flight attendant may hit her head".
"If the bus had brake suddenly, the laws of physics would obviously apply.
Just like a city bus or a tram.
The carrier must manage the safety of stewards by internal regulations", he says and also believes that from the point of view of the law, the problem is not solved.
Jančura is ready to cancel these services
Student Agency is the only bus operator to offer steward services.
He hires two hundred.
Even after the accident, the manager doesn't consider their job a risky one.
"However, as soon as I feel that it is a risky business, I will remove it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and newspaper on board.
It would also reduce costs", he says.
The reason given by the director of Asiana Alexei Litvine for the absence of stewards in his vehicles is safety, which, in comparison with SA, provides a very small number of lines.
"We don't have hostesses, we've been opposed to it from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident", he told Týden.cz a year ago.
A great tragedy has occurred.
A young hostess from the Plzeň area, who had been working for the company for two years, died in the accident on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stop lane without using a blinker and blocked the way to the bus.
The driver of the latter tried to avoid him by means of a sudden maneuver, but he approached him by his right side.
Jančura refuses to accept that the two seats reserved for the stewards' rest have been sold.
"In the case of long-distance lines, it is not possible to reserve these places, they are blocked".
The company plans to sue the truck driver.
As far as the girl's family is concerned, the agency will not wait for the court's decision, but as far as financial compensation is concerned, it is also counting on the culprit.
A change in the law?
Not in sight.
An amendment to the law, which has been in the works for over a year by a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport, could provide clarification as to the movements of stewards on board the bus.
"But it has not reached any conclusion on this point.
In fact, it is not so much interested in buses as in the points system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of the mobile phone while driving", says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of stewards as something that would fundamentally endanger the safety of passengers", spokesman Hanzelka concluded, adding that the control of bus safety is under the authority of the police and the Office for Safety at Work.
The Düsseldorfer hopes were once rested on Frankfurt.
The letter from the WestLB management committee to the employees of the company was full of words.
The merger of the entities of the Düsseldorf financial institute with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank could create the "central financial market institution of the Sparkasse financial group", according to the letter published on Monday.
WestLB would provide a 'block of jurisdiction' with a doubled sustainable productivity in such a case.
In any event, such a relationship could be the decisive trigger for further mergers in the banking sector in the Länder.
This is what it looks like when a steering committee is keen to demonstrate its capacity for action in difficult times.
Because WestLB, injured, is still under a lot of pressure.
It is not only the European Commission but also the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority which, only recently, made it clear to the government of North Rhine-Westphalia that time was running out in the search for a future solution.
However, there has been talk for some time now - also on the Frankfurt side - of some kind of relationship between Deka Bank, which knows Sparkasse's clients from their investment funds, and WestLB.
It is true that Deta-Bank head Franz Waas stated at the end of August, when presenting the figures for the six months, that he saw no point in merging the Mainzer Landstrasse house with a Land bank, whether Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka, each half of which is supported by both the Länder banks and the savings bank groups, instructed the Management Board to conduct talks with WestLB with a view to joint commercial activities.
This could be the flow of the financial market, or parts of it.
The talks have only just begun, however, as the financial community says.
This is not the first time that Deta-Bank, which with its 3000 employees is one of the largest employers in Frankfurt's financial district, has been involved in the consolidation of the savings bank sector.
In 2003, it was thought for a while that Deta-Bank might merge with the Land of Palatinate bank and Halbab.
Nothing came out of this three-tiered bouquet.
The plans were not made public until the government of the Land of Hesse had declared itself against any participation by the Hellaba in them.
Later, the other two houses also did not join.
The Land Rhineland-Palatinate bank was instead attached to the Land of Baden-Wuttenberg bank in Stuttgart.
But there were always new negotiations on the merger of Deka-Bank with banks in the Länder.
Finally, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Hellaba Management Board, had, however, expressed his opposition to any commercial strategy of merger with his bank.
Apart from this, there seems to be a widespread feeling that the grouping of the various public sector institutions is particularly urgent.
The Bank of Germany has also been involved in the restructuring of the Bank since the restructuring of the Bank of Germany.
For the Helaba, that's not particularly good news.
If the pressure to merge new companies were to increase, the potential partners would gradually escape him.
In the South, it would now be a junior partner, although it has so far withstood the crisis better than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
The Hesse-Thuringen savings and transfer group, which owns 85% of Helaba, put a stop to any merger with WestLB at the beginning of the year.
The NordLB would remain the strictest.
Such geostrategic considerations, however, reflect only one aspect.
Another aspect is how the different business models of each of these banks can be matched.
In June Merl stated that the crucial question of which business model should ensure the future capacity of the Länder banks had not yet been resolved by the German grouping of savings and transfer banks.
In the long run, a cutting of WestLB could take place, which is obviously not desirable here.
This is also what is mentioned in the letter from the existing management committee: in any event, a 'comprehensive solution' would be sought for the establishment.
How this will all be put into the same basket with the merger of certain entities with Deta-Bank remains to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer festival is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, it's the first time, for Luca, it's already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena is with him as his girlfriend, so nothing is the same, he says.
Behind them, near a five-liter keg of Kaiser beer, stands a well-built beard that shows the 200 or so visitors to the beer festival what deep sounds its throat can produce.
Elena hits Luca first, then she kisses him.
From Bologna, they came all the way to Verona.
From here, from the bus station near Puorta Nueva, four buses depart at 11.45pm tonight, '`destinazione Monaco, festa della birra', scheduled to arrive at 6.30pm.
Three buses are reserved primarily for Italians, and one bus is for Brazilians only.
In one corner of the parking lot, South Americans singing gold and already next to their flag, they already celebrated last night.
And they're noisy, Marco Guarda says, not for Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, who wears a long coat with a false fur coat and glasses with large silver frames.
They've been going to the beer party for five years, three firings this year alone.
They go there at night, stay the day at the party, and come back at 10:30.
Spending the night would involve unnecessary expenses, Marco explains.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome pot with a Kaiser beer, brewed according to the Bavarian purity law, health insurance and a German-speaking group leader - Marco took a language course in Frankfurt.
And already the buses run at night on the Autostrada in the direction of Brennero'.
There's no beer, not yet.
Soon, everything calms down on the bus, the passengers fall asleep.
It's better that way, they'll still need their strength.
Stops will be made in Bressanone and Holzkirchen, while a large number of other buses with Italian number plates will once again stop shortly before Munich on Highway 8.
When Marco's group finally arrived at 6:30 a.m. in the parking lot near Place Therese, nearly 50 other buses from all over Europe were already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco gives a final speech, explains the plan of attack.
First, wear the little yellow cap.
On the left side of the sign is written 'Festa della birra', in Gothic, and next to it is the internet address of Marco's travel agency 'conoscersiviaggiando.it'.
Second: `When the doors of the beer hall open, we run,' cries Marco in the early morning.
Run and book the seats at the back of the tent.
` Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all the yellow hats on the same benches, we have to distribute them in the room!'
"The cup", said Marco, "is worth eight dollars and twenty-five cents".
And remember the instructions!
` To show the security officers that we behave well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone!'
Third: "Tonight, come back here at ten and a half o'clock!"
And that's it, it's off to the beer party.
On the way, someone ties yellow hats to trees to find the way, to signs and even to a voting poster of a major Bavarian people's party.
We want to be ready for the return.
It's the second weekend of the beer festival, known as the Italian "week-end".
There are no precise figures, but there are speculations that 50,000 people are heading across the Alps and crashing into the beer kiosk, with 10 percent of the visitors coming from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven South Tyrol police, by Italian volunteer rescuers who support the Bavarian Red Cross, which compiles a statistic on the countries where Italians are in first place ahead of the British (60 interventions) and the Austrians (about 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions.
The tent of the Hofbräu brewery is especially popular with Italians.
Sleepless nights for the shareholders of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, the Federal Minister of Finance insisted just a few weeks ago.
It is fortunate that the politician used the word 'relatively' and that he hinted that the German banking sector would not be spared from the crisis movements.
This one did happen this weekend.
The Bavarian real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE), listed on the DAX, obtained a loan of 1 billion from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from market turbulence.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that aid credits are being issued for up to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate would now have to pay interest on the fraction to which it would be entitled.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
In the background, the subsidiary Depfa is the one that bears the losses.
The State financier had, according to a newspaper article, refinanced himself very short term for long term projects for which he had borrowed money - which is no longer possible because of distrust of the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash reserve had been reduced by 95 per cent to EUR 2,37 million, and the equity ratio had also fallen slightly from 1,6 to 1,45 per cent.
Current and net financial transactions were down to zero compared with the same period last year, while earnings from the allocation of fixed assets and liabilities and the cancellation of provisions in credit operations were down by more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
Only the substantial profits from the reimbursement of downstream accounting costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as the reimbursement of interest on the tax procedures and commercial purchases for Konzern's companies, have been able to moderate the profit shortfall of around 16%.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former state financier had firstly speculated badly on industrial real estate loans, which were subsequently affiliated to Aareal Bank.
Because conventional state financing was not profitable enough, Depfa then became more involved in infrastructure projects and in financing joint projects between private and public investors (Privat-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
On the value of the subsidiary, Hypo Real Estate must make depreciation payments which should have a material and significant effect on the calculation of the group's profits and losses, but which is still rather vague.
The fact is, the dividends have been cut.
By 2007, they had been cut to two thirds.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major investor in State and infrastructure since the acquisition of Depfa.
It is more robust than other institutions dependent on refinancing on the interbank market since it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending between banks has again become considerably cheaper as banks have accumulated liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs a short-term refinancing facility for a part of the Depfa loan portfolio - about EUR 50 billion - each year.
According to a statement from Hypo Real Estate, the group's financing needs are covered by medium-term credit and the company is protected from the influence of the international financial markets which are largely out of order at present.
Other sources say that the refinancing would be secured through the funds until the end of 2009.
HRE's Chairman Georg Funke, however, explained that Hypo Real Estate should no longer have to resort to medium-term financial markets.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bafin) assume that the market capacity of the Hypo Real group is now secured.
The bank's shareholders and creditors can only hope.
However, given the dynamics and the immensity of the crisis, there is no certainty.
It is not inconceivable that the whole of the funding should not be used.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out either.
After the fact that the bank is, according to the latest reports, still on the verge of insolvency on Sunday evening, this at least temporary bailout will not succeed in reassuring the minds either.
The share price fell by 75 per cent to 3.30 euros.
Bond prices, on the other hand, are doing particularly well.
While the main debts have barely moved, the secondary lending prices are falling.
The most affected are investment funds of the former Württemberg Hypo subsidiary and those with a life beyond 2009.
The Hypo Real Estate bonds previously appeared to be an alternative speculative investment, but their value must now be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international banking system following the net worsening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself which brought the crisis into the establishment through the buy-out of Depfa.
As long as the less affected issuing institutions, governments and commercial banks are still willing to support the system, it can be assumed that the lags will be resolved over time.
Or what no one dares to hope for now will happen - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in the face of renewed rumors of partial nationalisation, the probability that security was approaching has now become a mere hope.
This should give sleepless nights primarily to long-term creditors on the decision whether to separate from their commitments.
Short-term investors can always use what they have drawn a line on to postpone losses for the next few years on the next automatically levied capital gains tax.
Sylvana and the secrets of the box in Bento
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, has to go to Tachibana High School for the first day, the girls start to laugh: German is so "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word from the Manga - in her new Trade Log, she talks about Japan.
"First day of school in Japan.
What-I was excited.
I was scared even on the way to school.
I live in the suburbs of Tokyo on the way to Kawasaki and I take the train 40 minutes to Tachibana High School.
I had to find my way by myself, fortunately I didn't get lost.
The beginning of the school year does not seem to be as strict as in our country in Lower Saxony.
Students appear one after another from eight o'clock until nine-twenty, when a round table with the teacher, the "home room", begins.
But before the class started, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I'm not the kind of person who likes to speak in front of people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I did not yet have my school uniform, I put on an old skirt of my foster mother, as well as a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
So in this outfit, I presented myself to the pulpit, and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy that I had started to learn the language two years earlier.
The 31 girls in the class all did low mass, sniffed and gestured, and I kept hearing the word "Kawaii".
I knew him from my manga.
It is a vital vocabulary for Japanese teenage survival and means "cute, cute".
Then I quickly slipped into my seat.
The girl next to me gave me a big ironic smile, she thought it was an honor that the correspondent should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was pretty quiet, but when the gong rang, I was assaulted in the rules.
Everyone was talking to each other, laughing and asking me a lot of questions - in this case, it's pretty hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, they all came out with their Bento.
My foster mother also made me this kind of lunchbox - it's really different from the miserable German lunchbox.
I had herbal rice, little sausages, a cucumber and seaweed salad, fruit, and some meat with tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat exactly here in Japan.
Things have a strange look and a completely new taste.
What's certain is that everything is really good.
Well, except maybe the salted plums and jams, brrrr!
Bentos are not just Japanese school lunches.
Sometimes a girl offers a boy a Bento she has prepared herself, which is then prepared with particular care - in the hope of getting to know the boy a little better during the break.
I read that in my manga.
I'm curious if I could observe it here too.
"Why Japan in particular?" my friends asked when I told them that I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
I always said:
"Because it fascinates me, what?"
After all, reading manga has been my favorite thing for years.
And in order to better understand manga and the culture that is there, at some point, I also started learning Japanese.
It was very clear to me that I had to go there one day.
Because I also have a soft spot for traditions, customs and customs.
And here, they're given a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever been to".
Rats have feelings too
A rat or a cockroach fleeing danger, does that mean they also feel fear?
Neurophysician Joseph LeDoux is convinced of this: many animals also have sensations.
But how can we verify that he feels the same when he behaves the same way we do?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles the answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness which I or anyone else has not been able to prove up to now just as we cannot prove that other human beings have a consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and address the issues of feeling or consciousness in general, we enter into difficultly practicable terrain because the hardware doesn't match.
When a rat is in danger, it does what many other animals do: it fakes death, flies or attacks.
Humans behave in the same way, which is why some scientists infer a comparable subjective experience.
However, I do not believe that.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transpose our subjective experience into that of animals.
One aspect is that circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its involvement in short-term memory and in the functions of direction and execution).
This vast region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and appears to be entirely absent in other creatures.
So at least for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including our awareness of who we are, and our ability to predict and make decisions, it's reasonable to assume that humans are even different from other primates.
Another significant feature may lie in the linguistic nature of Man: since a large part of his existence is linked to language, this often means that his consciousness depends on it.
In that case, we could exclude animals.
But even if consciousness were not to depend on language, it would certainly be influenced by it, so that animal consciousness, no matter how it is produced, would probably differ greatly from most of our states of consciousness.
This makes it difficult to determine what the conscience might be like in other animals.
If this is internal and subjective and cannot be measured or, because of this particular hardware, analyzed on the basis of our own experience, then its observation poses big problems for us.
Most of my developments refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more easily accessible scientifically.
We could look at the consciousness processes of animals without considering their content, and that's exactly what happened in studies of the short-term memory of primates, especially with the example of visualization.
But in this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, we focus more on the neural correlations of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: the two may or may not be identical.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex in the realization of visualization.
But what does that do for emotions?
I'm concluding that an emotional system like fear is activated in a conscious brain of its own activity.
What we call "fear" is the mental state we find ourselves in when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its aftermath, such as body reactions) takes over the vivid memory.
So, emotion is closely linked to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates, and especially humans.
Subtle degrees of feeling, associated with our fickle nature, emerge, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to imput them to others besides ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that sensations from primitive activities originate in the body sensation regions of the cortex and brain stem, as does Jaak Pankseep, who focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could well have participated in cross-sensations of all kinds.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict it, but I believe it is indemonstrable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fear in humans and rats is likely to be felt as such in both cases: how could we verify that rats and humans feel the same when they behave in similar ways?
A cockroach runs away from danger, but what if he feels fear?
I don't think that similar behaviour is enough to prove that we've all had the same experiences.
Of course, the nerve comparison helps: rats and humans have similar brain stem, whereas cockroaches don't even have a brain.
But is the brain stem the source of the sensations?
And even if we could prove it in humans, how could we prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have sensations.
But I wouldn't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are probably completely different from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, there is considerable progress on the nervous level, since the same measurements are made in rats and humans.
Since I'm not exploring language and consciousness in rats, or sensations, I don't know if they exist.
You might think that's short-term, but I'd rather move on than constantly be banging against a wall.
I'm a pragmatic emotional guy, you know.
UEFA President Platini: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government considers the UEFA decision to hold the European Championships in Bordeaux as a sign of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise the European Championships in cooperation with Poland", Wasjunik said.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is still much to be done in both countries".
In the timetable of the construction or demolition of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts are running after deadlines.
The number of stadiums for the European Championship could possibly be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must work at maximum speed", said the President of the Ukrainian League, Grigory Surkis.
"UEFA is watching us all the time".
A more radical measure was taken in Poland.
The management of the Polish football league PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, an independent administrator.
The committee met at the request of Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "a real danger that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules", said Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured in a letter to the UEFA President that the preparations for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer".
Several members of the First Division league were already convicted of mandatory relegation manipulation in the previous season; in the end, the start of the league had to be delayed at the last minute.
Dennis Quaid outraged by counterattack
She wanted to promote a new movie, spoke about her personal life in an interview - and now she's in trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has unveiled her adulterous ex-boyfriend Dennis Quaid.
He foams - and counterattacks.
A late Rose War for ex-couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors engage in a disgraceful battle - in full view of everyone.
Last week, Meg Ryan told the American newspaper InStyle about the causes of her marriage's failure: "Dennis cheated on me for a long time, and it was very painful".
She would have learned the extent of the deception only after the divorce.
The motive for this thought striptease lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - it tells the story of an adulterer.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his characterization as an unfaithful husband was clear: "It would be monstrous", Quaid told the New York Daily News, 54, "for Meg to rewrite the story of our relationship and manipulate it".
It would be even more "unfortunate" if "the pain and upheaval of divorce for each child were to be relived in public" for their 16-year-old son Jack".
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and will soon be the father of twins.
This was his reply to the pinch: "At least my life goes on.
I feel blessed to have a wonderful family that is doing the best it can".
Air and hotel prices fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and hotel stays were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a recent study, theft could even be reduced by up to 50 percent.
Flights and hotel nights would be more affordable - this is the result of a study by the financial and travel services provider American Express.
The company analysed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and found that, after a price increase in the first quarter, profits fell sharply in the second quarter.
After years of rising hotel prices, hotel nights have already fallen in many places.
From January to March, prices were still rising in 41 of the 48 European cities examined by an average of 6.9 per cent compared with 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities examined.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 per cent lower than the previous year.
The trend was particularly marked in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37 per cent less than a year earlier.
American Express blames the weak dollar for the "declining travel appetite among American tourists".
Financial centres such as Frankfurt or London would also be more affected by the fall in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices are holding steady with a 26.3 per cent rise, the highest in Europe.
Also in the case of flight prices, the trend was upward in the first quarter:
As a result of the increase in fuel prices, passengers in economy class had to pay on average 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, while the cost of long-haul flights, which are very fuel-intensive, increased by up to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, economy class ticket prices fell by an average of 12.5 per cent compared with the previous quarter, in business and first class however, price changes were far less pronounced.
In Germany prices fell even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9 per cent, in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 per cent.
German domestic flights were even split in half according to this study.
The reasons for this fall in prices are, on the one hand, the slowdown in economic growth, the firm explains.
Demand would give way in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be increased competition pressure from the Open Skies Treaty which liberalizes air traffic between the United States and Europe.
The high number of airlines reportedly filing their accounts in the first half of 2008 - 24 in Europe alone - and the elimination of non-profitable flights by airlines are signs of the tense situation.
HSV beat Gladbach by one.
With a simple goal and methods, SV Hamburg is first in the standings.
In Borussia, Luhukay has still not been able to find a functional eleven.
The landing in disaster for international player Marko Marin.
Gladbach's player came back late into the game and his shot failed to hit the goal frame.
His message was clearly formulated, it came out of his lips in a persuasive way.
He just knew he was right.
"We need this second goal", whistled Hermann Rieger in the locker room of the Hamburg arena.
There wasn't much going on in the locker room, halftime was over, and most of the people had gone to their seats.
Rieger was for nearly three decades the physiotherapist of HSV, he enjoys a great reputation as many former protagonists.
And that's why his request was received at the strategic places.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol agreed and raised his thumb to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
Whose orders seem to have been similar: and let it jump with this second aim!
The implementation was lacking.
"Everything was not very nice today", later admitted Marcel Jansen.
Bastian Reinhard "would have liked to have been more relaxed".
This 1:0 (1:0 at half-time) Hamburg team owes to a successful head-stroke by Mladen Petric (in the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak players of Gladbach could not hurt the weak players of Hamburg.
"It was a dirty win", Marin Jol summed up.
The Hamburg SV will celebrate its 121st birthday this Monday.
Already on Saturday afternoon, the fans were celebrating themselves, with the blue sky above the arena and the provisional leaderboards on the giant screen that indicated their club as the best in the class.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to take a step back", said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the intermediate result of the table reflects more the unpredictability of the Premier League than the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its late arrivals - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen from FC Bayern - is slowly forming, but it is not yet bright.
"We need more charm and more dribbles", Jol demanded.
After the failed vote
Wall Street is full of fear.
Early news of the failure of the bailout caused the Dow Jones to temporarily drop 700 points.
That was the biggest one-day point loss in history.
Later, the Dow Jones caught up a bit.
At 8:30 p.m., the world's largest stock index was at 10,579 points, down by as much as five percent.
The Nasdaq Technology Stock Index was at 1548 points with a decline of more than seven points.
The biggest losers on the Dow Jones were American Express, which lost almost 14 percent, and Bank of America, which lost about 12 percent.
No more stocks could make a profit.
The shares of Goldman Sachs Bank fell by almost ten percent.
Just a few days ago, the great investor Warren Buffet had partnered with the company.
As part of the bailout, funds must be mobilised to buy what are called bad mortgage bonds.
However, the amount should not be paid out at once, but gradually.
In return, the State should recover options on the shares of the financial company which can be traded in correlation with the price movement in order to reduce the burden on the Treasury.
The price of the stock sucked into the whirlpool in Europe and the United States
The billions of dollars in aid for banks in Europe and the United States are not easing the concerns of investors.
The share price of the big German bank Hypo Real Estate is collapsing and pushing the Dax down.
The Dow Jones is collapsing despite the government's planned financial market bailout.
The sharp fall in prices of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank led to a deep deficit in the German Dax.
The shares of the Bavarian real estate financier have lost three-quarters of their value despite the bailout of the federal government and private banks, with Commerzbank reporting a drop of more than 20 percent.
The Dax fell sharply below the important psychological bar of 6000 points and stood at 5,839 points with a deficit of 3.7 per cent.
All over the world, stock markets have fallen to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with substantial losses.
Investors feared that the US government's massive $700 billion bailout plan might not be enough to restart the financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10,809.25 points lost 334 points or 3.3 percent in the first hour of the opening.
The U.S. House of Representatives intended to vote on the bailout, with the Senate vote expected to follow on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges also took a different direction: in London the FTSE 100 index fell by 3.2 per cent for the time being, while the CAC 40 in Paris fell by 2.9 per cent.
In Asia, the main Japanese Nikkei index fell to 11,743.61 points after rising 1.26 percent.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index slipped by 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the main Sensex index fell by 506.43 points or 3.9 per cent and closed at 12.595.75 points.
In the MDAX, Arcandor's shares fell after the announcement of a capital increase.
The private bank Sal Oppenheim has subscribed to the 23 million new shares.
The multinational trade and tourism company also announced that it would not sell its shares to Thomas Cook.
Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has puzzled researchers: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during what is called gravitational support maneuvers.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not completely correct.
For almost 18 years, the Ulysses spacecraft has been flying through space.
Because of the soon-to-freeze fuel lines, it's threatened with cryogenic death.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been causing concern among researchers - the gravitational support anomaly.
Gravitational support is a maneuver by space probes, whereby they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The U.S.-European Cassini-Huygens spacecraft used this physics trick, as did the Ulysses solar probe.
This is what has puzzled researchers for years: flying objects do not always behave 100 percent the way we expect them to, according to the venerable laws of gravity.
Moreover, irregularities appear at the speed level.
The probes suddenly get faster or slower.
Until now, physicists could not explain this effect.
They called it the gravitational support anomaly.
Some experts feared that Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes the force of attraction of matter due to the curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton still firmly believes that Einstein was right and tries to explain the gravitational support anomaly using what is called the dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"Dark matter could be responsible for this anomaly, matter that is also found near Earth", he writes.
Space scientists have known about the existence of dark matter for only about ten years.
It apparently emits a force of attraction that is observable on other celestial bodies.
It is completely invisible, that is, it neither sends nor reflects any electromagnetic radiation, especially visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, dark matter would still make up about a fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt freed
After 10 days in the hands of their captors, the tourists kidnapped in Egypt are expected to be released, as confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister.
The Sudanese kidnappers had demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the shooting before the release, six hostage takers were reportedly killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were kidnapped.
Negotiations for the ransom would have already begun.
The Germans are always in the crosshairs of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE presents the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are apparently free.
This was reported jointly by the Egyptian state television, the Arabic television channel Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after news reports from the Italian TV channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We are checking their health", said Frattini.
The five Germans, the five Italians, the Romanian woman and their eight Egyptian companions are safe and sound, Egyptian national television reported.
The 19 participants of the desert tour should already be on their way to Cairo.
The circumstances surrounding a shooting before the hostages were released remain unclear: the kidnappers would have been close to stopping the abduction, according to an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers without a cry.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom", the officer said.
All that remained was to collect the hostages", when suddenly "this surprise" happened.
Sudanese soldiers shot dead six of the kidnappers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and arrested two of them.
The kidnappers had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany, which was to be paid by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily El Masri El Jom reported that, according to a German mediator, the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, the kidnappers wanted to release the female hostages after the ransom was paid.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers found a safe route to escape.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this story.
Abuse by a stepfather" that led to suicide"
A court was informed that years of abuse by her stepfather led to a woman's suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, was jailed for six years after pleading guilty to eight counts of indecent assault.
The Truro High Court has reported that he regularly bound his daughter-in-law, Stephanie Randle, during her childhood, from 5 to 7 years old.
Trerise wrote in a letter of confession, "I feel responsible for his death".
The court has been informed that Ms. Randle, aged 34, committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007.
As a child living in Coventry, Trerise had her tied up and bandaged before forcing her into sexual acts, while her mother worked in the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
Her daughter-in-law went to Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Miss Randle, a dedicated National Trust volunteer, was haunted by the abuse she was inflicted twice a week.
Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends had told him that Ms. Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, had appeared "emotionally dead" since 2006 and had "lost all hope for life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in his Plymouth apartment.
We think she committed suicide by choking on a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's father-in-law, who had also written a letter of confession that ended: "I tied her up and bandaged her regularly".
"I did not sexually abuse her.
"I feel responsible for his death".
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise, "You're really weird as a fetishist, your victim must have been terrified, especially at the age of seven.
"This unpleasant saga ended with the victim's suicide.
And what is even more amazing is the fact that if she hadn't done that, her story would certainly never have ended in court".
He added: "I particularly stress, as her father and mother describe it, the effect of your crime committed over the years on Stephanie.
"Without them, she would probably be a happy, promising, successful young woman today".
Conviction for the loss of official data.
The Cabinet Office minister who forgot top secret documents on a train in June will be convicted under the Official Secrets Act, the BBC has learned.
The man from the Ministry of Defence was on the move when he forgot two highly classified documents on a train headed for Waterloo.
The documents passed into the hands of the BBC before being handed over to the police.
That is the least serious condemnation of this act, without any hint of criminal intent.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said that this episode had a lot of Whitehall people.
"They must have thought that this case would have remained between the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet Office", he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed is accused of violating section 8.1 of the Act, that is, the clause dealing with the safeguarding of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service has suggested that the ministerial officer be placed under the guardianship of the Metropolitan Police, given the highly sensitive nature of his work in connection with the Associated Committee of the Secret Service.
The documents he lost contained assessments of al-Qaeda as well as resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was then taken from his home to a secret location.
Building companies face the B&B bill.
British building companies could have to pay a bill of over £80 million to cover the bailout of the Bradford & Bingley bank.
The Government has provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of the 2.6 million Bradford & Bingleys savers.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all the companies that collect the money from the savers, including 59 building companies.
The CEO of the Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was "irritating" to know that the companies and their members will have to pay the pot broke...
The £14 billion loan will be repaid when the Bradford & Bingleys mortgages are cleared.
But the interest, which will rise at the same time, will be charged, every year, to the 700 financial companies that collect the deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that all 59 companies in the building are included in this list.
It's irritating to see that institutions that have been prudent... now have to pay some of the bills of institutions that were much less prudent.
The Commission has not yet adopted a decision on the application of the rules of origin.
It is proclaimed that each company must pay a proportionate amount to the deposits it holds, and that intermediary companies must pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will rise in 2009 to £450m.
This means that the companies will have to find £81 million to pay the interest in the first year.
Adrian Coles, chief executive of the Commercial Committee of the Building Companies, told the BBC that he felt the decision was unfair.
It is 'irritating' to see that institutions which behaved prudently during the recovery of the housing market now have to pay for much less prudent institutions.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, when the earliest records were made.
"We need to look at all aspects of this case over the next few weeks to assess the options to avoid building societies and their members paying this hefty bill", said Mr Cole.
The interest for 2009 covers seven months, from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, interest will have to be paid for the whole year, which could indeed double.
Since building societies are non-shareholder organizations, their members end up paying the bill either by higher charges or by lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Milk rises to five pence a litre
Jersey people have to pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise the wholesale price of its milk, from five pence a litre, starting Monday.
This is the second price increase since a two-penny increase in February, and it comes as a result of research by a consultancy firm.
Retailers must decide whether they, in turn, will increase the price to consumers.
Before the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk had last changed in 2002.
Former Bangladesh PM denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a request for bail for former PM Sheikh Hasina, which could lead to her arrest upon her return to the country.
Her lawyers said the court refused to grant her bail because she was being questioned for extorting 50 million Taka ($729,000) from a businessman when she was PM.
This case is one of many charges against him.
Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina's longtime rival, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh in a few weeks, but her party, the Awani League, has demanded that the country's provisional military government give her full freedom first.
Correspondents pointed out that the terms of her release are contradictory because if she is allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they do not see why she could not remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers have announced that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the Supreme Court's order.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's request saying she does not require bail as she was allowed to go abroad for medical reasons", her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
"We will appeal against the Supreme Court's order"
Her lawyers argued that she needed the bail to return to the country to prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after October 17, a former Awami Party leader said.
She was detained last year after the military interim government took power, but was released in June to seek medical treatment abroad.
Sheikh Hasina and Zhaleda Zia, deny the charges against them.
Concerns about the Afghan polio campaign.
In Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have missed the recent polio immunization campaign, due to Taliban-related violence, the UN said.
The UN carried out a vaccination campaign in the six provinces last week.
But she says she is unable to reach children in the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, located in the south.
A UN spokesman said this happened despite Taliban promises not to attack or obstruct the thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB loses the ITV court battle
BSkyB lost its case following the ruling of the Competition Commission, which would have forced it to reduce its stake in its rival broadcaster ITV.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet decided whether the aid granted to BSkyB is compatible with the internal market.
The Commission stated that, in the past, MSkyB's participation had prevented competition and allowed it to unfairly influence ITV.
BSkyB bought its shares in 2006 following an agreement to effectively prevent NTL, now called Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that BSkyB's purchase of ITV shares had cast doubt on ITV's effective independence, thus prompting the Competition Commission to investigate the alleged breach of the
Virgin's boss Richard Branson, a consumer group and the regulator Ofcom were all opposed to the purchase.
BSkyB replied that forcing it to reduce its shares in ITV would not be reasonable and on the contrary would be excessive  especially since BSkyB has just renounced its voting rights.
New investigation into the U.S. attorneys' case.
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the dismissal of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
It all started with a report on the case by the Inspector General of the Justice Department, who criticized the actions of some departmental officials.
The report was critical of White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the lawyers' argument that their dismissal is due to political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers interviewed during the investigation lied to investigators, thereby obstructing justice.
"Serious, unsubstantiated allegations of potentially criminal conduct have not been fully confirmed or resolved", Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appointment of a special prosecutor capable of forcing witnesses to testify was one of his biggest recommendations.
The dispute began with the dismissal in December 2006 of nine U.S. prosecutors by the U.S. Department of Justice.
At the time, the department had said that the prosecutors were fired for poor performance.
But it later emerged that the fired prosecutors were not more criticized than their other colleagues, prompting some observers to attribute political connotations to the firings.
Some of the prosecutors were accused of being close to Republicans in Congress, while others reportedly refused to investigate allegations of voter fraud against Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors investigate and prosecute government prosecutions.
It is true that they can be dismissed at any time, but not for political reasons.
The head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, was eventually accused of being involved in this firing case, and in the end, he resigned.
A number of ministerial officials from the Justice Department also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was very critical of Mr Gonzales' role in this case, stating that he considered him "primarily responsible" for these dismissals, and eventually "abandoning" his role as leader, "remarkably succeeding in not being involved in this case.
Other cabinet officials, including former Bush aide Karl Rove, were critical of the failure to cooperate during the investigation.
The epic of Meat Loaf must be honored.
Rock star Meat Loaf, is to be honored at the Q Awards for his epic song "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will receive an Oscar at the ceremony in London next week, said he was "honored" to receive the recognition.
The nine-minute-and-fifty-second song was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
The award night is presented by Coldplay, with this year's selection restricted to four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell certainly is one of them.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a high-pitched voice like Meat Loaf's.
It begins with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK as a single in 1979, charting at number fifteen.
In addition, his album Bat Out of Hell stayed nine years in the UK charts, and sold over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - or Marvin Lee Aday, as he was actually called - has been in poor health for the past few years, even undergoing surgery to repair an irregular heartbeat after collapsing on stage in 2003.
In 2007, severe laryngitis forced her to cancel concerts.
Then they found a cyst in her vocal cords.
A dark street in the city, often forgotten, and may soon be for sale.
New York City has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets, and other parallel roads, some famous, others purely functional.
And even some veteran taxi drivers and longtime local residents can't give directions to Extra Place, because they've never heard of it.
The street is in the East Village and runs north of First Street - not to be confused with Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
At about 30 feet wide by 120 feet long, it looks more like a dusty driveway than an active artery.
There's no signage on the street.
It's virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
This street has admirers, though.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the builder of the recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He'd like to redecorate Extra Place, and create a more seamless passage to the shops and boutiques, which are expected to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers, including longtime neighbors, have said they are charmed by the shortcut simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets in the block.
But the city's Department of Conservation and Housing Development, which runs the street, has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of the neighborhood owners' committees, representatives from the city agency and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal to allow the real estate developer to buy the street.
But the committee prefers the street to remain in the hands of the city and has asked for a new proposal to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of Committee No. 3.
"There is very little city-owned space left, and we would like the city to keep Extra Place", she said.
"They could offer to restore it and manage it, which Avalon could do, but we want to keep it public".
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that it wanted to redecorate the small street and install seating, some of which would be used by a café to which the developer would grant the space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, spokesperson for Avalon Bay, said that while the company wants to exploit the street, it doesn't necessarily mean it wants to own it.
"Avalon Bay's main interest is to re-visit this abandoned driveway, and make it public", she said, noting that it was the city that suggested the sale".
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Real Estate Preservation Agency, confirmed that the city was willing to sell the street, adding that the agency's mission was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical imprint.
Some believe that Extra Place has been known by this name since 1802, when the large farm inheritance of Philip Minthorne's many children was divided, leaving this small piece of land, which has since been abandoned, to the side.
The back entrance of CBGB, a punk rock monument closed in 2006, reopened at Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the photo on the cover of the Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
"this place was beautiful", said Danny Fields, the Ramones' manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
It was full of scrap metal, rags, barrels, posters, leaves and ropes".
Some residents, including bloggers who had previously talked about the East Village's evolution into luxury, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble little property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a real rarity - a fragment virtually identical to the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Contests: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Extinction") recounts the story of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker.
Author Brendan Gill wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow little cul-de-sac, dark by day and dark by night, bounded by rusty warehouse doors and shutters, full of newspapers from the past week flying down the gutters".
With few exceptions, the street always looks the same.
A rat is running along the back of the alley, near a door that used to lead to the CBGB, now the headquarters of a fancy clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls, an empty 22-ounce beer bottle, lying next to newspapers that have just been thrown away.
A few bystanders said they rarely thought about Extra Place, and suggested it be upgraded.
Mr. Field, for his part, said he thought some underestimated the appeal of the street in its present state.
"The best years of my life", he said, "were spent in dark, damp, disgusting places".
The Bilingual Debate: Immersion in the English Language
In this part of the Education Supervision program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates' position on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, former California Studies Fellow and former director of the education department at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of "Not as Good as You Think: Why Middle Class Must Choose Their School".
Getting the favor of Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's proposals on education are an interesting example.
Mr. Obama's campaign is emphasizing that "African-American and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students". That's a fact.
To combat these differences, Mr. Obama's education program supports, among many other things, "bilingual transitional education" for those who learn English.
However, the question for Obama is whether his desire to achieve bilingual education that advocates teaching in classrooms of languages other than English, overrides his interest in eliminating differences.
Take Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
The students at this school are mostly Hispanic, low-income.
More than one third of the students, many of whom are newcomers, are studying English.
Of the students of CM1, 100% passed the 2008 state maths exam, expert level.
Similarly, almost 93% of students passed the English-language-arts exam
This incredible success was achieved by another ingredient than the one put forward by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street relies on analysis, practice, constant assessment of capabilities and an exemplary attitude.
In addition, and this is an example that Mr. Obama could copy, reports Linda Mikels, principal of Sixth Street, the school has introduced "full immersion" English language instruction.
Total English language immersion focuses on the almost constant use of English in teaching.
Ms. Mikels, who is against bilingual education, told me, "We had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you went without his class, you would have no chance of identifying him".
"It works", she observes, "it worked for us"
Shouldn't Mr. Obama take the example of Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in other schools with mostly Hispanic students learning English?
The excellent results achieved by the school speak for themselves; but the education policies within his party (the National Education Associations have long supported bilingual education) and his enormous support for bilingual education obscure the prognosis of Mr. Obama's response.
While he is in favor of immigrants learning English, Mr. Obama recently dismissed this issue as insignificant, when he proclaimed that we all need to stop arguing about how laws are worded in English.
"On the contrary", he said, "you must make sure your child speaks Spanish".
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate differences, then he should carefully consider the educational models that work, rather than dismissing them or considering them as insignificant.
Oil net fall following new economic concerns
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday as people feared the financial markets bailout plan would fail to revive the economy.
Crude oil futures trading has fallen 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel.
Prices have fallen by more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by financial turmoil on Wall Street, as well as by two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After rising to $145.29 a barrel in July, prices fell to almost $90 a barrel this month, before rebounding again in the face of deep financial market uncertainties.
This Monday, investors are once again worried despite the largest bailout deal in history, reached this weekend by congressional leaders.
The news was tempered by recent concerns that the crisis would be long-lasting.
In the latest episode of this financial disaster, "Citygroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation", the government said Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts said that the frantic weekend negotiations that ended with the bailout deal "seem to have failed to revive the market".
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to slow.
"The prospect of overall equity, interest rates and exchange markets has become uncertain", analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote in a letter to their investors.
"we think that raw materials will not be able to escape this contagion.
"As far as raw materials are concerned, our most pressing concern is to understand how far the American virus would spread globally and in particular, in China".
The Bank's analysts have lowered their expectations for next year, as oil consumption declines due to slowing economic growth, and were therefore forced to cut their 2009 oil and gas price forecasts by 20%.
The decisive second-half party for the team's record improvement.
After spending the last eight seasons, longer than anyone in Jets uniform, Shaun Ellis, the defensive back thought he'd seen it all.
He was watching the second half, when the Jets turned a 0-0 game into a blast.
"I've never seen anything like it", said Ellis.
The second half began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals played a dirty game in the dark.
Then quarterback Brett Favre managed to pass Laveranues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, a sign of an afternoon in which their relationship took a leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns, the first when a corner back fell and the second, 10 seconds into halftime.
"I didn't get out of my zone", Favre said about all his passes to Coles.
"he's a poor player"
"We communicated extremely well, despite what people think".
While Favre and Coles were wrestling, the defense was beating Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, cornerback, intercepted a missed shot and ran 32 yards for the touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted her.
Linebacker David Bowens let the ball slip because of Warner.
At the last change, Bowens's ball loss, might be the most charming event
The Cardinals took control of that possession for the final 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely made a 20-yard field goal to take a 34-0 lead.
That was the best the Jets could score in a while.
Jets coach Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this insanity, said, "The second half or the third?"
When told both the Jets gave up 21 unanswered points in the third quarter, Mangini said: "I can tell you I enjoyed the second half more than the third.
"Many points were scored in a short time".
Gebrselassie is resting, breaking his world record.
Haile Gebrselassie, Ethiopia, has once again proven worthy of his title of best long-distance runner of the century, after breaking his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday, becoming the first person to run 26.2 miles in under 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a 2:03:59 victory in a comfortable flat race, Gebrselassie beat his previous record of 2:04:26 set last year in Berlin by 27 seconds.
At 35, Gebrselassie has set the 26th world record of his great career during which he won the world championship or the world record for any distance, the 1600m marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing - perhaps exaggeratedly in today's eyes - that air pollution would increase his asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny weather, 48 degrees at the start, 55 at the finish - Gebrselassie won on Sunday, now an impressive average of a mile in 4 minutes 43 seconds
Track runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyan, who have converted to cross-country running, have contributed to the decrease in the marathon record by more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazil's Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2:06:05.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that he had suffered from calf cramps two weeks earlier and missed training for a week.
Obviously, resting helped him stay bright, but not rusty.
"I'm so happy", he told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again last week, and today I had doubts; but in the end, everything went well.'"
He has been criticized - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's African rival - for over-orchestrating his races, avoiding world marathon stars, actually relying on hares as if they were in a track competition, and considering world records more than the meaning of the competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie's abilities as a long-distance runner.
Dimanche Gebrselassie, led by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the leaders disappeared.
Just over three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made his final climb to break away from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal best by five minutes.
Kamathis came in third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year with a seventh-place time of 2:19:19.
The Englishwoman Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprised everyone by winning the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She was unable to compete in the Beijing Games because of a hypothetical back injury, but promised to win in Berlin, improving her personal record of almost five minutes in her third marathon.
She ran using a clever strategy, leaving the group of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners to take a big lead, then overtaking them about 18 1⁄2 miles later.
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenyane, finished third in 2:25:01.
In a Separate City, Pride and the Trials of Black Life
Hidden in its vast parkland development, a few miles from sunny, bright and gigantic Orlando, lies a quiet little town where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first all-black city to be incorporated, the childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, that description she made in 1935, is not so easy to make today". The city of five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of guavas, two schools and no prison.
It's now a pilgrimage town
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Zora Festival held annually in Eatonville, to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And in many ways, the city she describes -- which became a tourist destination thanks to its inclusion in the Florida Tourist Guide published by The Depression-era Federal Writers' Project -- remains a place of its own.
It is as independent, dignified, and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston told how the rural black population of Florida was often reluctant to share their true thoughts with the white man, who "knows so little of us, doesn't know what he is missing".
Even though this is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has also called for an open dialogue on the issue of race, many here remain wary of the outside world's gaze.
"We are very careful about how we tell the story", said Hortense Jones, 59, a longtime resident and the town's oldest parishioner.
"it must be in line with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and fighting.
It represents both a historic model of a black takeover and a community of nearly 2,400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a central point but also an example of rural Southern black culture - sometimes disregarded, sometimes acclaimed - that recalls the birth of American slavery.
Which would explain why the residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, whom everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through heartfelt, dialect-filled books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed this town, located just off of Route 17, into a road that runs through the often forgotten center of Florida, ending in a chapter of black history and human drama.
As bold as a big box in life and literature, Hurston led readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Mr. Joe Clarke, which was later divided into several private parts.
"On the left of the road", she writes, "you will find the modern brown and white public school, with its well-preserved gardens and playgrounds, which Howard Miller always took care of, though he could hardly read or write.
She further mentioned Widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells all kinds of drinks and anything else that passersby can use.
So in barely a hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
Of course, Fodor was not like that.
It wasn't really a portrait that everyone liked.
Zora described the reality well: "Ella Dinkins, 90, one of the young girls of Johnson whom Hurston immortalized, quoted the colourless songs, performed by men who praised their beauty".
She added: "Some people didn't like it".
Hurston is still remembered as a lively and eccentric person, who returned frequently after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston usually arrived in town without warning, riding in a large Chevrolet with a cigarette in his mouth and wearing trousers here, where even today people are proud of their traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many laughed at her.
"People were always happy to see Zora", he said.
But he added, rocking in his backyard chair overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was likely baptized, that "she never stayed too long".
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of print.
Eatonville and the world seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in a private grave in Fort Pierce, Fla., where she lived.
In Eatonville, no big memorial, no plaque for the general public.
I don't think they understood the contribution or legacy she offered to the world", said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A turning point came in the 1980's.
Orange County officials wanted to build a five-lane highway through the city, replacing Kennedy Boulevard, the community's two-lane main street.
Orlando's development has already pushed Interstate 4 to the west corner of the city.
The proposal was made as Eatonville was just recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among many other things, ended the community's relatively idyllic isolation.
In the 1950s, the race controversy led to hatred at the community's doors.
"At that time, a bunch of young white men would come and throw oranges or other objects at people sitting on the side", Mr. Franklin said.
"one lady has even died".
They threw a watermelon out of their car".
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's request for forced integration, calling its decision in Brown v. Board of Education "insulting rather than glorifying my race".
Residents now proclaim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, while positive in some respects, has diluted Eatonville's cohesion and weakened youth confidence.
"Black children used to be kissed - I remember well - we kissed our master in the morning, and in the evening", said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the Eatonville Community Conservation, a nonprofit group.
This continued, she added, until the time when teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You don't kiss your white teacher because he's white - I mean there's a cultural line here", said Ms. Nathiri.
Civil rights, by the way, allowed for the creation of space for many other Zora Neale Hurston-black writers, actors and artists who went beyond prejudice, such as herself, armed with a cheerful self-confidence and such lines of conduct as: "how can they deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company!"
I can't do this".
In 1975, writer Alice Walker visited Hurston's anonymous grave and began a struggle to revive his reputation.
Five years later, a critically acclaimed biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway, a true bestseller, reintroduced her to the American canon.
The highway project came just as Eatonville's most famous girl had regained her charm.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors see her as a savior.
The community started to organize a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences of the highway.
Hundreds of fans came to the opening of the festival two years later, and many return in January to commemorate it.
After many years, the county rejected the proposed highway.
"The five-lane highway fiasco, extremely fast, a real civic pride", said Ms. Nathiri.
Miss Boyd summed it up by saying, "Zora saved Eatonville".
The victory against the highway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been attending our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been a historic city since 1998.
A new one-theme library (of course named Hurston) opened in 2006 on beautifully landscaped Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: six miles from Orlando, it can at any time consider itself a back alley on a rainy summer day, as small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(now 90 percent black)
Foreigners who come to learn about Eatonville's history, its purpose, are still treated with caution.
Permission is required for most interviews, and some things - like the walls of the old Eatonville church, painted by the white man, depicting black men in the fields - should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Miss Jones, a courageous teacher with a soft spot for bright red, are still afraid that their island community will be understood.
However, as Hurston Festival expanded, a certain level of local pride emerged.
Young people in particular tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw his entire race: beautiful, problematic and all, no better or worse, but as proud, creative, bulky, crazy and mixed up as other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is genuine civic affection that is heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or the police force, which needs additional reinforcements.
And even for the younger ones, like 11-year-old Alondra and Alexia Kenon, the Winter Park twins, they seem to have learned the description of Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, who pass through this area there, will think :" Oh, this city has nothing compared to others", Alondra Kenon said after the mass last Sunday.
But if you stop and take a moment to contemplate the history, it's a very beautiful city".
Here in New York, everybody is fluent in finance.
But nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newsstands and the giant TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't realize they're in the eye of the hurricane.
Never could they have thought that in the glass and beehive offices above their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York City are having the worst "day at the office" since the 1929 crack.
Delivery men continue to sneak up on the sidewalks, with their carts and muffin trays for the morning meetings.
Latinos still roam the apartment buildings carrying, like mules, about 50 fancy shirts hanging from a yoke laid on their shoulders.
Office workers continue to queue to buy their morning sandwich from street vendors, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 4 and 7 p.m. on weekdays.
I hadn't felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic accounts until this afternoon when I decided to go and open a new savings account.
Fortunately, I had planned to work late in the afternoon, for I found about 20 people lining up at my local branch of J.P. Morgan Chase.
Not at the cash registers, not to withdraw cash or make a payment, but at the customer service counter, where regular customers ordered their checkbooks, tourists asked for directions to Macy's, and new customers opened accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I would later learn from Starr, my "authorized personal banker", were all lining up for the same reason I was.
Not in the same way, for they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, such as those in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They've pulled their money out of savings accounts called thrift, credit unions, and the kind of local savings banks and their subsidiaries that only operate in one state, and say they treat customers like family.
In the recent past, 15 of these banks failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 in capital, has filed for bankruptcy, and as New Yorkers headed home for the weekend this Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with savings accounts worth $440 million, was desperately looking for a buyer to rescue it.
The office and store employees in front of me, afraid of another potential debacle, transferred their money to a bank that seemed to them reliable, the most bailout bank on Wall Street.
Some New Yorkers have become quite familiar with the world of finance in recent weeks.
"I heard a lady at my local Chinese supermarket, talking on the phone about Lehman Brothers, the bankrupt bank, and its skinny CEO Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity she might have had to criticize a colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed janitor in my building, changed the subject of our usual conversation to Brad and Angelina or deliveries from my fruit and vegetable store.
She told me, following my visit to the bank, "I put all my savings into the money market.
"I've changed, I don't want to take any chances".
Muslim graves desecrated as Austria swings to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who has left the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization "Cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry traffic signs depicting mosques with red stripes.
Police accuse far-right extremists of desecrating an Austrian Muslim cemetery on the weekend of the victory of far-right political parties in the country's general election.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at the Traun cemetery near Linz between Friday night and this morning, according to police, in an organised operation.
The perpetrators painted Jewish symbols such as the Star of David on several graves, but detectives believe this may have been done to disguise the extremists' hatred of Muslim immigrants.
Could this accident be somehow election related?
A spokesperson for the local Islamic Community said she was "deeply shocked" at the announcement of the desecration, which comes just as the religious month of Ramadan is coming to an end.
Austria is seriously considering regaining its courage, following its swing to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two extreme right-wing parties that garnered almost 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, have been campaigning against immigration, and some of their slogans have even been criticized as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won over 18 percent of the vote, led his campaign against the wearing of the scarf and burkas, and even expressed his opposition to alaha food.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a European brotherhood" to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both parties tried to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, proclaiming that they would be a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses conducted just after the elections defined the far right as the strongest political bloc in the country, as demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made a difference, because they were worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is banned from traveling abroad.
Courts have banned glamorous rock star Gary Glitter, accused of child sexual abuse, from living in France and Spain.
The judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he told the authorities who controlled him that he intended to travel to Spain via France.
Kent Police issued the travel ban last Thursday after they found Glitter guilty of child sexual abuse.
Glitter, or by his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the hearing at the Ashford limited jurisdiction courts, but was nonetheless represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A court spokesman said: "On Thursday 25 September at Ashford Court, Kent Police requested an application to prevent Mr Paul Gadd from travelling to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd was not present at the time".
Glitter, 64, informed the authorities that he wanted to go abroad, even if he was to be registered as a sex offender.
It is obligatory to inform the authorities if you wish to go abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police 7 days before his planned departure.
If he does not report his movements to the authorities, he could serve a sentence of up to five years in prison.
Kent police said they would not discuss any specific cases or potential movements of Glitter in the county.
A spokesman for Kent Police said: "Kent Police will do everything necessary to protect our children as well as those from abroad.
"we think it's easier to monitor someone who stays in the UK because we have devices that can manage any potential risks, much more effectively.
"protecting the people of Kent is the most cherished intention of Kent Police, and we closely monitor the behaviour of those accused of sexual abuse in the area, to minimize potential risks to the public".
Glitter returned to the UK last month after serving 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for molesting two girls, aged 10 and 11, respectively.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok from where he was supposed to board a flight to London.
But he said he wasn't feeling well, and refused to go to London.
Thai authorities blocked him at passport control, and he ended up going to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused him entry, and he was forced to return to Bangkok; Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Heathrow Airport Terminal 3 on 22 August and remained there while his lawyer, David Corker, went to the Uxbridge Court of limited jurisdiction, West London, to register him on the list of people accused of sexual abuse, as required by Scotland Yard.
Glitter had previously served a four-month sentence in the UK for possession of child abuse images.
A source at the Interior Ministry said that Jacqui Smith, the Interior Minister, was reassured and happy to learn that Glitter had been banned from traveling to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master off stage to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photographer
No heels or foreign clothes.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, free from all tension to achieve the relaxed aspect of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
The other is the person.
Inseparable except in the intimacy, in those moments unknown to the general public, where one discovers through intimate gestures and stealthy looks the artists who don't bother to come on stage.
German Günther Bauer combines the theatricality of a few stagings with singers, dancers and guitarists with this lesser-known side of the artists in "Flamenco - people".
In this project, the photographer takes the particular iconography of flamenco from different angles.
Included in the Flemish Photography Month program, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, growing every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco - people" "can be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people photographed "in the street" are artists who are able to convey on stage passion, sadness, joy... by capturing the audience.
To capture moments of the personalities of these artists, you don't have to take pictures on stage.
They have their own personality and character.
What I was interested in was creating an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with my camera the moments of the personality of flamenco stars".
With the "People's Song of the Mines" festival, Bauer began in 1997 a long journey to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
These are portraits which, thanks to the choice of camera and equipment, recall the classic photography.
The implementation of different stylistic means breaks with the classical side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises every day".
It is not the dance or the singing itself, but the personality and character of the artist that captivates the audience with his art.
The search for the essential and the magic has been the constant of this work which is being presented these days at the El Fotómata gallery.
Flamenco stars such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are among the selection made from around seventy photographed artists.
The project has turned into an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book of portraits exhibited at the gallery.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits of Old Athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves to photograph people's portraits, get to know them and be able to enter their lives for a moment or so.
I think in photography, portrait is the most difficult kind.
You're in front of people, characters that sometimes you don't know or who only give you a few minutes to take a picture of them.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true".
This collection of portraits of contemporary flamenco, entitled "Flamenco - people", is on display at the El Fotómata Gallery, located at 20 Rue de la Mata (a street parallel to the Peupleraie d'Hercule), which will be open until October 16.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he is writing is "very bold"
The novel is set in places no one knows and deals with unknown subjects, but once again, Mario Vargas Llosa is well-determined to advance the new project he is working on, a novel that has as its main character Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived for twenty years in the Congo and who has passed through the Amazon.
The Nobel Prize winner for Literature confessed yesterday at the Hay festival in Segovia that the novel he is currently working on "is a real audacity" and that "everything shows that he should not write it".
"If I were reasonable, I wouldn't do it, but I will do it and I hope to finish it", he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas and thoughts that for four days saw a parade in the city of the aqueduct of a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was the most anticipated character of the third edition of this festival and fulfilled his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival prize with the majority of the votes cast, filled the theatre with people.
The Festival presenter, Félix Romeo, found himself facing a fascinated audience who did not see the hour that had passed during which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with a great dose of humor, traced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "his thirst for reading" and "to live new experiences"; how he wrote in a "very methodical way" through an intense work of documentation, correcting and rewriting part of the text to face his "lack of inspiration"; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his vocation and how his memories inspire his novels.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know whether books change lives. "But I refuse to believe that literature is pure amusement, a fleeting experience", stressed Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people less alike", because writers were asked "not to let themselves be carried away by frivolity" and to assume their vocation.
Bad weather ruins the Pozoblanco fair
The flag party that concluded the Pozoblanco bullfighting fair was suspended yesterday morning, after the bull riders checked that the arena was impassable.
Thus, the organizing committee, in agreement with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the bullfighting.
The bad weather was a major factor in the event, as two out of three parties were cancelled.
Saturday's rain prevented the celebration of the second bullfight scheduled.
The poster was José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz y Juan Bautista, who should have been in the Castilblanco arena
So only the Friday party took place
On Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut off three ears and was carried off in triumph, after making arm movements in front of the bull with taste and aesthetics.
That afternoon Alejandro Talavante concluded on two banners planted on the back of the bull and a severed ear that the uncovered stands applauded more than his fight with the bull itself.
Even worse for El Juli, who entered the arenas of Los Llanos without difficulty or glory.
In his fight with the second bull, after a much better fight, he was whistled at by most of the audience.
Police check of a van in Alava province: 2,000 kilos of hashish found
It's five minutes to ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Euskadi police (Ertzaintza) at the border of the Municipality of Armínón (Alava).
Police officers arrest two occupants of a van and the latter two attempt to escape.
His cargo, over two tons of hashish, enough to stop them.
Police pursued them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man, identified as A. A. J., according to information released by the Interior Department of the Basque Government.
The individual arrested was charged with drug trafficking and forgery of documents.
The incident occurred when various officials from the Alava Traffic Unit were conducting a vehicle check on the N-1, at the border of the Municipality of Armínón.
They were about to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed orders, suddenly accelerated and the check started.
The police began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped two kilometers down the side of the road, where the two occupants got off and fled into a wooded area.
The Basque police finally arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The back of the vehicle was loaded with hashish balls, and they then transferred it to a police station for a thorough inspection and for weighing the drugs.
In addition, the officials found that the license plate had been "forged" because it did not match the one written on the grey card of the van, and for this reason they also charged the detainee with the crime of forging documents.
The Ertzaintza continues its investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to escape and to determine the origin of the seized drugs.
The prisoner, A. A. J., 28, has been remanded in custody to carry out the various procedures and will be tried in the coming hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda from the TV series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the influence of a drug.
A witness saw her performing strange maneuvers while trying to get out of her garage in Montecito, according to a spokesman for the California State Police Patrol, told People magazine.
The witness said that at about 4:30 p.m., Locklear "was pressing the gas pedal hard, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and backing up several times, she rolled on her sunglasses".
Shortly after, the witness, who at first did not recognize the actress, saw Locklear stop in the middle of the highway and get out of her vehicle.
This person, at that moment, called the emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life".
When the police patrol arrived they found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"She looked disoriented", so the officers took her to the drug and alcohol center for a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and alcohol abuse was ruled out from the start, although "from the police officers' first-hand observation, we thought Locklear was under the influence of a drug".
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an unspecified substance and was booked at around 7 p.m. and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was released from the Arizona clinic where she was being treated for a nervous breakdown.
Llamazares called on the Andalusian federation of the United Left to take responsibility in the Silva case
The general coordinator and deputy of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it is the regional federation that has to make a decision on the case of the former youth and sports councillor of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of performing favourable treatments to members of his family.
"In these cases, I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities", Llamazares said regarding the behaviour of the political party that he will have to adopt in the Seville city council.
However, the leader of the United Left demanded that investigations be "transparent" about the irregularities Silva may have committed: "The United Left has always defended this kind of affairs so that they have a maximum degree of transparency".
He also pointed out that the political party has "very strict ethical codes for all civil servants".
"Blood of Mayo, the daring gamble of Garci
Inspired by the stories of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous battle of the Spanish against the French in "Sangre de mayo", which is the most ambitious film of his filmography with a budget of almost 15 million euros.
The filmmaker has tried to "stage the many characters and illustrate the social analysis" he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of actors.
The more than two-and-a-half-hour film, "Sangre de mayo" will be released in cinemas next Friday, which will then become a four-hour television series for Telemadrid.
A great admirer of Galdós's literature, José Luis Garci assures that with this film he has realized "a child's dream" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him, three years ago, to shoot a commemorative film for the bicentennial of the 2nd of May in Madrid, something he always accepted when the narrative stuck to national historical facts.
The 15 million euros provided by the Madrid Commune is a "unique opportunity" for Garci to reproduce with the appropriate decorations and clothing the atmosphere of "a Spain that has been mistaken for a leader for the fight, since the struggle for independence led the people to rebellions under the reign of Ferdinand VII", he said.
But the filmmaker regrets not having obtained funding like for the films "Captain Alatriste" or "Les fantômes de Goya" - more than double that obtained for "Sangre de mayo" - because he could not shoot some scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he collaborated for almost his entire career.
The filmmaker of "Volver a empezar" has influenced his usual way of working, the staging of the actors, with whom he is used to rehearsing before starting the shooting and whom he does not cast, since it seems to him "humiliating" and considers that "the role of the filmmaker is to go to the theater and the cinema to keep informed".
Many actors in "Sangre de mayo" rehearse in front of the camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Four times Oscar nominee (he won one), Garci considers that the three candidate films that represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy, "Sangre de mayo", "Seven tables of French billiards" and finally the winner, "Los girasoles ciegos", are not representative of the young Spanish cinema, "which deserves to be better known", he said.
With this film Garci doesn't expect a prize.
"At first you think you're working for posterity, then you realize you're only working for prosperity, and now you're content to make one more film", explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional work.
Isabelle Bayón is playing the role of the Sevillian dancer Tórtola Valencia
A Sevillian dancer is going to pay tribute to a Sevillian dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and at the age of three moved to London with her family.
She was a freestyle dancer and an expert in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, a pioneer of women's liberation, like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated for the abolition of the corset which prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman, who marked the history of dance in Europe between the two world wars, fascinated Isabelle Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she offered me to play the Sevillian dancer Tórtola Valencia and it seemed incredible".
According to the dancer, "we are not trying to tell her life story but to translate her way of thinking.
The titles of her dances reminded me of flamenco.
So, "butterfly dance" reminded me of a Cuban folk dance and "snake dance" of some tangos.
Her dancing was sensual and they told me that my dancing was identical to hers", she says.
The production was made possible by two outstanding contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing Isabela again in one of his shows, as he had done in "La puerta abierta"; and that of Professor Matilde Coral, who was exceptionally willing to collaborate with the one who was his student.
"Matilde is turning Tórtola into a mature character.
I am happy that she has accepted a part in my work, and it is an honor".
The staging was also made possible thanks to the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres y Paco Arriaga, the popular song of Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Morón; to the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this type of artists who were considered divas".
This work also tells, in a way, the life of this woman who exhibited in such distant places, especially for the time, as in India, the United States, or Russia, but also throughout Europe, since she usually resided in London.
"I wanted to remember her because I think it was these women who had a huge influence in their time and now nobody knows or appreciates her work", says Bayón.
The show will start at 8:30 at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The publication of the "Diary of a Newly Married Poet" concludes the Triennial
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of "Diary of a Poet Recently Married" in the Church of St. Stephen's in New York, the place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennat Zenobia y Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and their deaths.
Thus, the "Trinity of Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the re-publication of this work, with the International Congress held in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: This Poplar of Light" which was inaugurated last May and which, after travelling through the different provinces of Andalusia, will go to New York for the International Congress.
Similarly, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia purchased eight hundred copies of the "Diary of a Newly Married Poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the most famous Andalusian poets.
America is less pleasant without Paul Newman.
"Sometimes God creates perfect people
Paul Newman was one of them".
This sentence is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "No Evil", and it illustrates the desperation of American cinema, and of all of America, at the glaring idea that Newman is no longer of this world.
He had a hard time getting an Oscar.
It's been off the air since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
It was a blow to everyone.
"Sometimes one's feelings are beyond expression, and now I have lost a great friend", lamented Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better because of his existence".
No one was afraid of being ridiculed or exaggerated.
One of the fathers of cinema and the fatherland died during a particularly dark period, when terrorists and the stock markets were feared, the esteem of Americans had fallen very low, desperately looking for reasons for dignity.
When times are so hard and there's no reason to live, all that's left for human beings is admiration and you don't have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He embodied for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an enemy of Richard Nixon and an advocate for lost and defeated causes, such as the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honor of his eldest son who died of an overdose and the creation of his own brand of organic food.
It was a victory for a country that had struggled to impose itself against a suicidal food culture.
This expansive wave of admiration swept Hollywood without regard to nationality or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond had died before him.
Another Englishman, Oscar winner Sam Mendes, said working with Newman marked the pinnacle of his career.
The bad boy who came from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He has set us the bar high", said George Clooney, who may be the only one today who tries to break through the screen as Paul Newman did: by being very honest and having a serious private life and away from objectives.
It's still not easy or possible in the media jungle these days.
But there are those who try, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful even though he lacked opportunities not to be.
"But why should I eat a hamburger outside my home, if I have a steak in my fridge?" he used to joke.
In heaven, he proudly watches his daughters meet his fans on earth, something that is not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he has played, he has never been more proud than that of a devoted husband, a loving father, a caring grandfather and a philanthropist", they say.
Madrid in the race to host the 2016 Olympic Games
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can host the Olympics, after the failure in 2012, it could be realized in 2016.
But I wonder if we're ready.
If we take the example of yesterday's race, we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but I think it was the worst race I've ever been in.
If they had taken into account all the mistakes made during the race, they would have been eliminated.
But let's look at it in detail and start at the beginning.
Mistakes start with the backsliding, which forces you to go ahead.
That's not bad, but if they move you, it's better if they give you everything (including the electronic chip for the shopping).
Well, not at all.
They made you go there only to get the backpack (first mistake, move only for that) and (after a long queue) surprise!, there was only size 'S' for the jersey (second mistake, because I need a size XL)
What kind of world are we living in?
Is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy only short-sized shirts with less fabric and therefore cheaper?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on race day.
Besides the fact that you have to go very early to get the electronic chip, the line is 15 minutes and, moreover, you have to leave your backpack at the entrance.
The waiting time was more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible given that 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long line, the competitions started and we had not yet left our backpack at the entrance, although once done, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the more than 40-minute wait during which the barracks were subjected to rioting and assaults.
I think about 500 people will get pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me, we won't even be in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip they gave me that I think didn't mark the start correctly.
Of course, if they asked me to give an example of a perfect race, I would not think of that one.
So I think we can always dream of being the host city for the 2016 Olympics.
Microsoft is looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the MIT Emerging Technologies conference, Microsoft was introduced to a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of AI with little intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, like calling a taxi (or in Microsoft's case, a shuttle to get around the company campus) in response to what was asked during a conversation.
Using a camera and a face and shape recognition system, the "receptionist" can know how many people are in the room, who they are - including what positions they occupy - and listen and hear the key words of their conversations.
But also group them into conversation groups.
In the introduction video, the receptionist detects a third person but she understands that she does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not part of the company.
She asks him if she's here to visit someone and she tells him she'll answer in a few moments.
All this without a blue screen.
That's very impressive.
But of course it represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, like the next version of their operating system, Windows.
This week we've been talking about a change in strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and it won't have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were sold with the essentials instead of the unnecessary apps, they would run five times faster.
This is a breakthrough, since Microsoft has been adding features and extras to Windows version after version.
The change of strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, their operating system is losing importance but so is their software.
When Google Chrome came on the web, I was one of those who subscribed to the theory that Google Chrome is the first move by Google to compete with Windows.
Several people have rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operating system.
The operational system will always be necessary since it is the indispensable basis for computer hardware and software to understand each other.
He's the same function as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
That's right, I did.
It will never go away, but the "death" of the operating system must be seen not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed that idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system, but more and more to the web browser.
You only turn on your computer to run Firefox, Explorer, or Chrome, and every day people spend more time surfing the Internet than they do browsing windows.
Who does half the applications that come with the system work for?
Who can do more can do less.
And Windows 7 will have to contain fewer applications, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less crowded, less complex.
Right now, Microsoft is more interested in launching their own online services so that they can finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need this, and I'm going to give you an example.
The photo in this article was taken earlier this month in one of the Microsoft employee lounges in Redmond.
On the liquor machine, a poster asks them to use their own search tool - "Your research. Our future".
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week there was a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It won't be released in early 2009, but in late 2009 or 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 at the same time.
The phone, after all, is becoming more and more like a computer.
But with Android being late to launch and the iPhone already on the market, it's going to cost them.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick's Blood Diamond, as did Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather, and it is part of the outfit of the Muscular Gay Association.
And if we start listing all his appearances, we might also mention that big-mouthed weightlifter in a traveling circus.
It's not just a cotton body suit, molded and sleeveless.
The English call it a tank, but the Fabulous Marcel of Brussels stands out amongst all the others.
First, by his flamboyant name - although he is known as 'Marcel' - which has to do with sport since he is named after, according to legend, the boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
The 'Marcel' is distinguished by its fine cotton, its unisex cut, its distinctive logo, and the little (barely recognizable) Belgian flag worn around the neck of the most popular body suits.
But be careful, because the Belgian brand doesn't just make tank tops.
But it also makes sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere sweatpants, cotton pants, babies, mini-shorts...
Clothes designed for the comfort of underwear.
Although it's a shame to wear them only as underwear.
They're too charming.
"I want to be a young mother; the candidate doesn't worry me"
Her huge resemblance to her sister didn't stop her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Now the Cruz sisters are taking their new business in fashion very seriously.
Monica says they're not just pretty, famous girls who lend their name.
She was present at the promotion that the Mango brand did in Paris at its new headquarters but also at the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Monica is warm and shy.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I created for Mango for the new autumn-winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentino.
We're going to have a very busy but exciting day.
What is the basis of your new collection for Mango this fourth season?
We love the cinema of the 50s and 60s and we take a lot of inspiration from it for our collections.
I love to walk around the city and watch women, see how they dress, how they combine their clothes, I do that a lot.
Dancer, actress and cartoonist, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, it all comes together and these activities have a lot in common.
Since I was a little girl I liked clothes, and I longed to go to my grandmother's house and look in my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of my dress.
Dancers like to dress up for classes and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress, when you put on the clothes, that's when you really put yourself in the character's shoes.
So it's all connected.
You've been 30 for a while now. Has it been hard for you?
No, not at all.
I feel better than ever, I'm thrilled to be 30.
I find that women are more mature, more experienced, and enjoy life with fewer problems.
I'm not scared of the biological clock.
I've done all the things I wanted to do since I was a little girl and it's given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, are you thinking about becoming a mom?
Of course, I want to be a mom because my body wants me to be a mom, and I want to be a young mom, and I don't want to lose that.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
What I'm going to do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
Let's go to the movies, you wait for the different movies you made last year to come out.
I can't wait for them to come out.
I am a woman of theatre, I am very impatient and anxious, I would like to have everything now but of course it is not possible.
I can't wait for the movies 'The Last Hour' and 'In Search of the Tomb of Christ' to come out.
Let's see what you think.
A few days ago you started on the catwalk with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don 't say that !
I didn't climb the bridge to be a model.
It's just that Naomi Campbell called me, I've known her for quite a while, to invite me to participate in a charity parade in London for her women's support association, and the clothes we were exhibiting -- I showed two of our collections of clothes made for Mango -- were auctioned to raise money for Naomi's NGO.
People like Naomi is a tender-hearted person.
They say so many things about her, I know her, many things are not true.
And I'm fascinated by Naomi's goodness.
She asked me to march for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to do the pear tree, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for women in the Third World.
Repeat drinkers will have to install the 'alcolock' system
The Minister of the Interior wants drivers who have had more than three administrative penalties for alcohol, to have a system installed in their vehicle that prevents the vehicle from starting when drunk, or if it is not breathing.
The initiative was already announced last June and is now reflected in the Minister of State's report, which considers it a pilot project for a year.
The aim is to reintegrate the driver by offering them road rehabilitation courses.
The Minister of State for Road Safety, the Directorate-General for Road Safety and the Foundation Institute of Technology for Motor Safety will also participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75 percent of drivers arrested for more than one drunk driving offense are in the car.
The alcohol lock would avoid this as it is a system plugged into the vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the breath and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not blow first; or when the driver's alcohol level is higher than the permitted level.
The cost is more than EUR 1,000 and is borne by the driver.
In this respect, a study carried out in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced infringements by up to 65% in the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that this could save 115 lives each year.
This measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with such behaviour before it becomes a criminal offence.
And to facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done by ordinary means but, however, reform by penal means requires a reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet commercially available on the Spanish market, although some industrial and commercial vehicles already have one on an experimental basis.
The European Parliament will vote on an initiative by the Spanish Socialist Party to install the system in school buses, as has been done in France.
Mexico without the peep-toes
At 5:40 p.m. - the official time - the Spanish Air Force plane carrying the Princes of Asturias landed at the Presidential Hangar at Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun was about to set but its rays still forced the hand to be used as a visor so that the royal couple could see them get off the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other officials were present.
A few hours earlier I had asked the taxi driver on the street if he was aware that the Spanish princes were visiting the city to complete their official journey.
- Ah, well, then we can't go to the airport to pick up customers at this hour... are you from here or...?
- No, no, sir, I'm Spanish but I've lived here thinking for two years.
- Oh, all right.
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and the importance of the trip.
They're several in the airport hangar by the red carpet and a military line of 27 Marines.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in navy blue, the Princess, when she is, has her hair in the wind, is dressed very soberly and does not wear her usual 'peep-toes'; perhaps they had told her that a storm was threatening.
They stop briefly with the photographers before passing into the hall where the official procession awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they stayed, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a funny reporter from Mexican television was waiting for them.
The Most Prominent Fashion Award
There is surely no more appropriate place in the world to present a fashion award than Paris and there is surely no living cartoonist more extraordinary and good live than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to strengthen the international image of new fashion talents.
The winner will be awarded a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, was looking at her models in the Mango showcase at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and she was almost crying emotionally.
It is the second largest store of the brand in Europe, having just opened with 1,335 square metres of floor space.
The first shop is in London.
The events, together with the desire to thank the designer Valentino, the president of the jury, led to a lavish dinner at the Opéra Garnier in Paris.
With the extraordinary Chagals at the table next to it, the presidential table prepared by Mango looked even more spectacular.
Being fat on the heart and making good against bad luck, because of the recent death of her brother, Nati put on a Mango dress and some Elah jewelry, which took the breath away, and arm over arm under with her son Luis - a handsome man of almost two meters in height  she accompanied Valentino to his dinner prepared in his honor.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a gallant man, and the Baron de Rotchil, finished the evening without their coats because they had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who showed up at the store with a pair of her own pants and a shirt - and for dinner she changed into a long, sexy black dress, was moved when during the night tour of the opera house, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the ballet rehearsal room and, remembering the good old days, she grabbed one of the bars and made the gesture of a 'big fold'.
Inés Sastre did not stay for the visit to the palace's premises, but she showed us before on her mobile phone photos of her son.
The next morning we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Martínez - another handsome man riding his motorcycle - and John Travolta, who arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris with his sheets, towels and having asked in advance that there be no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, this is life.
1001, the stress-reduction number
There are not only 1,000 but 1,001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of everyday life.
And to top it all off, they're all listed in a book that will bring a little bit of relief to bookstores on September 30th.
The alarm clock almost makes us sad when it rings every morning at 7:00 a.m., but it is even worse when we think of the hectic pace of life we are forced to live in today.
The desk is a tension and the computer is a back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there is no one or two-way solution to the daily fatigue and problems of the world of work.
But 1001, not one more, not one less.
In addition to yoga poses, classic massage, and spa treatments, Susannah Marriott has compiled a book of "menu" methods that are tailored to each individual's taste and time.
The book, titled '1001 Ways to Relax', will be available in bookstores directly from Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If anyone believes that it is not possible to obtain peace of mind in places such as work or through personal relationships, this 'handbook' refutes such a belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that help you relax.
If adrenaline isn't running through your veins to restore balance to your body and stress has become a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, disconnect your mind and focus on reading.
Talking while sleeping
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean those who wake up very awake and tell us something that happened the day before, but to the children who talk in their sleep.
The first time it happens, it may surprise you, but it doesn't really matter.
It's a mild sleep disorder called somniloquy.
It's pretty common, especially in children and teenagers.
I'm sure there's more than one talking at night.
This phenomenon may occur very sporadically (once in life, for example, associated with a high fever episode), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month, etc.), the day after the child no longer remembers anything.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance
They are often associated with other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night terrors, bedwetting, or sleepwalking, but this is not always the case.
As mentioned earlier, they can also be associated with very high fevers, stressful situations or overexcitement.
It's a little-studied phenomenon anyway.
The intensity with which it occurs also varies greatly.
He may speak in a low, quiet voice, with isolated words, whispering or conversing with shouts, tears, long speeches...
If sleepwalking becomes very common, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist, to see if there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and to get an explanation for the problem.
We said it's a mild alteration, so there's no treatment unless it's related to another sleep alteration that can be treated (for example, if it's related to sleep apnea or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before bed.
So look for quiet games and avoid TV programs or series that are more or less violent.
With children who are very nervous and have difficulty relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm down internally.
This will allow the child to sleep more peacefully.
As soon as the sleepwalking occurs, try to remain calm.
Remember that it is harmless to the child and the next day he will not remember what happened.
Helpful advice
Don't wake him up.
It's no use, since he's unconscious and you'd wake him up.
Even though he talks, he's sleeping and resting.
Remember, if he is very anxious repeatedly, it is wise to consult a doctor or to find out what is causing the child so much anxiety.
If you understand what he is saying (which is not usual), do not be tempted to ask him questions for information.
You're not getting anything, because when he's asleep, he's not conscious enough to organize his thoughts.
Also, you will hear what he is saying, but you will not know what he is dreaming, so be careful how you interpret the information and draw your own conclusions.
Never tell a child that you can ask him questions at night to find out his secrets.
Not even in a joke.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, don't worry, it's not a bad thing, it's an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... at last
Illhaeusern finally found the way to victory on its own soil after a long period of famine.
Without making a big game, the Yellow and Black created the most chances and managed to turn one of them into the game winner.
The pace was not very steady during this match where the attackers had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by the visiting captain Kauffmann who was approaching the skylight on a shot from a distance, Illhaeusern was going to take the slight ascendant and in turn Fonderflick from a distance, then with Hirn above, Romain at the tip of the foot or Diebold came tickling the defense of Dannemarie.
In front, we were blocking midfield and just leaving the restless Riahi at the head of the attack.
The start of the second half was to be decisive with first two chances signed by Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the score was opened for the Illhousians by Marais, well positioned to retake a repulsed ball on a first attempt by Diebold (53rd').
But the Illhousians scorer will not be able to enjoy his happiness for long and will be forced to return to the locker room about a dozen minutes later, leaving his teammates outnumbered.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not pose any big problems to an Illhousian Eleven who just backed off a little to "compress" his defense, except in the very last seconds of play when, after a big caffoulage, the ball passed very close to the crossbar.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour through Brittany.
In view of the demonstration of force by the fishermen who on Monday severely disrupted the access to several Breton and Norman ports, the President of the Republic decided to go to the port of Guilvinec, in Finistère, on Tuesday morning to meet their representatives.
The latter promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hoped that he would "come with concrete proposals".
The presidential visit coincides with a general meeting of the 'crisis committee' set up by Breton fishermen to seek measures to tackle the skyrocketing price of diesel, which has reached a record high of more than 1.14 euros per litre on average.
According to Elysee spokesman David Martinon, the President "will discuss with them solutions that can be devised to help their companies regain competitiveness and to secure the employment and remuneration conditions of seafarers".
Nicolas Sarkozy is firmly expected by the fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted snail operations in Morbihan and Calvados, causing traffic jams of nearly 10 km.
The Quiberon marina was also blocked, but the routes to Belle Isle were not stopped.
A filter dam has been installed on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors showed their determination on Monday by burning tires and pallets at dawn in front of the fuel depots at the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic and Channel fronts, such as Sands d'Olonne in the Vendée, where the trawlers remained at berth, or Le Havre, where some 20 ships blocked the movement of merchant ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique region, stopped the blockade of the important Total refinery in Donges in the evening.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer authorities have decided to wait for the meeting on Wednesday at the ministry to decide on possible action.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" is due to decide on Tuesday what action to take on the movement and whether it will participate in the meeting scheduled at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not give up anything" and "they do not want to move to Paris", said Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient fisheries committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but estimate that the threshold of profitability of a boat is reached only with less than EUR 0.30 per litre of diesel.
Paul Newman the magnificent
The unforgettable "Butch Cassidy and the Kid" performer died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes have hailed the film legend and accomplished actor, Paul Newman, who has died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecast for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer is on the brink of 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threat of recession looming over the global economy.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, is maintaining its 2008 delivery forecast with 215 aircraft delivered, its chairman, Fredrico Fleury Curado, has confirmed.
In the first six months, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer has high hopes for the Chinese market, particularly for its aircraft in the range of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG is considering divesting more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which has been bailed out by the U.S. monetary authorities, is planning to sell more than 15 percent of its assets to pay back the $85 billion in advance, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is prepared to consider selling most of its business beyond its international life insurance and retirement business in the United States, the newspaper said, citing sources familiar with the matter.
The board of directors of AIG met on Sunday evening to discuss possible divestments, according to the FT.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets AIG is considering divesting include its air leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings, and its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the FT adds.
No final decision has been taken on these divestments, FT continues.
AIG must quickly raise liquidity to repay the $85 billion loan from the Federal Reserve, at the risk of the US authorities taking 80% of its capital, diluting the existing shareholders proportionately.
Paris Historical analysis of the morning meeting Historical morning meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported a historic drop on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson plan to bail out the banks: the Dow Jones dropped 6.98%, a loss never seen before, approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell by 777.68 points to 100.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the biggest drop in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the resumption of trade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The technology-dominated Nasdaq index fell 199.61 points to 1,983.73 and the enlarged Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 8.81% (or 106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed at the start of the session, Wall Street sank after the House of Representatives unexpectedly rejected the bank bailout plan that was supposed to restore some stability to the markets.
By 228 votes to 205, the representatives denied Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the funds he requested.
Almost two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
"It's a bad signal to the market, which sees Congress unable to pass a plan", said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"This shows how much the market was counting on this", she added, fearing that a draft adopted in several days would be "too late".
"If the project is indeed moribund . . . then the relay will quickly be passed to the Fed and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further tighten credit conditions", warned Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, "every day brings the downfall of a financial institution" in the United States, Ms Piegza stressed.
After Washington Mutual went bankrupt on Friday, authorities arranged for the purchase of Wachovia's banking business by rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, prompting emergency intervention for banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, signalling that markets are facing "not just a US crisis, but a global crisis", FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market has gone up.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond fell to 3,632%, from 3,827% on Friday night, and the 30-year yield to 4,161%, from 4,357% the day before.
Obama, winner by points in the first televised duel
The first debate on Friday between the two candidates for the White House was followed by another to see who won, John McCain or Barack Obama.
Not surprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign leaders declared their own victory in this televised duel that would have been watched by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, while honorable, was not "brilliant" enough to stop his decline in the polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion poll released on Saturday gives Obama a five-point lead (49 percent to McCain's 44 percent), believes that the Democrats have pulled the trigger.
Among undecided voters, who are the ones that matter, Obama won by 39 percent of the poll, while 25 percent of them gave McCain the win, according to a CBS poll.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the expected good performance of his running mate, Joseph Biden, in the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She has good instincts", warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
The 70-year-old McCain has consistently emphasised his unquestionable experience in foreign policy, while also pointing out the "naivety" of his opponent on these issues which were at the heart of this first face-to-face meeting.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that"... he repeatedly accused.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and the knowledge to be president", he added.
A point of attack hammered since yesterday in Republican TV commercials.
Obama, on the other hand, emphasized that he represented the future.
He was not discouraged, but he was concise and precise.
He has shown his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore America's image in the world.
"McCain still doesn't understand, while Obama does", a Democratic spot this weekend said, blaming the Republican for not taking full account of the impact of the crisis on "the American on the street".
"During the 90 minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you", Obama said yesterday, before 20,000 people gathered for an election rally in North Carolina in the pouring rain.
He didn't even say the words "middle class" or "workers". The financial debacle clearly benefits Obama, who is seen by Americans as the most capable of saving the economy on the brink.
"The coming week could be a turning point", said the influential Democrat Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration official, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current debacle "is the final verdict of eight years of bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
Reaffirming that he would still be able to cut Americans' taxes by 95 percent despite the Wall Street uprisings, the Illinois senator also indicated that achieving the country's eventual energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy was his first priority, with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a fleet of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates have been cautious in avoiding questions about the $700 billion financial rescue plan passed by Congress last night and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "Did you notice that there was an election, you?"
Young people and opponents demonstrated on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the early results of the legislative elections.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening as soon as the polling stations closed in the central square of Minsk to protest the fraudulent nature of the legislative elections.
While no results had been announced, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "The dictator, resign".
Some people admit that they did not even vote. "It's no use, since they will do whatever they want with my vote", says one youth.
They do not believe that the regime which has been appealing to foreign observers in an attempt to get back in touch with the European Union is ready to make a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including visa bans on 40 Belarusian leaders and asset freezes, could be lifted if the election is deemed clean by observers.
They have not been according to the opposition.
"We were kept out of the electoral commissions and our observers could not participate in the counting", lamented Yuri Potemkin, the spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
"It's a cosmetic change", says Alexandre Milinkievitch, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and a leader of the pro-European movement, "because it's who counts the votes that counts, and in our country it's the executive.
If the opposition enters parliament, it means they have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament may mean television space, regional meetings and legislative proposals".
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because 'dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, goes into crisis, and we don't reform, we risk becoming a Russian protectorate.
We want to be independent".
The opposition fears that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitored the electoral process, will recognise the validity of the vote.
It stresses that the turnout figures appear to be too high, and that the widespread use of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the door to all forms of manipulation.
"Did you notice that there was an election?" asked Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be no more than five opposition MPs in parliament, those who are best suited to power".
The silence of the night falls on October Square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission are congratulating themselves on their success.
Interview - From Blood to Safety
Yesterday, Héma-Québec celebrated its 10th anniversary, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, because Héma-Québec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood suppliers in the world.
And most importantly, it has regained the public's trust that had been seriously shaken by the blood-tainted scandal of the 1980's and 1990's.
As is well known, the national blood supply, administered by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service, was contaminated with acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980's.
In response to this tragedy and public outcry, the Government of Canada in February 1994 instituted a public inquiry, headed by Justice Horace Krever, to find out what had led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations to prevent such a disaster from happening again.
While Krever was delaying in filing his report, some provinces then set up a committee with the goal of planning a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee fulfilled this mandate.
As a result of the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Corporation to supply all other provinces and territories.
"When Héma-Québec started in 1998, only 38 percent of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec", recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
Through efforts to improve the safety of blood products and work in the field over the years that followed, we have regained the public's trust", she says, proudly stating that by early 2008, nearly 94% of the Quebec population now had confidence in Héma-Québec.
However, Dr. Decary notes that "trust is an extremely fragile thing".
Since its creation on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, Europe was witnessing the outbreak of many cases of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which has been the dominant one since its founding in 1998.
"And we didn't know if this disease could be transmitted through blood.
We have therefore taken one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, namely that when we do not know and a serious disease can result, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by degeneration of the brain leading inevitably to death, exclusion measures should be introduced.
In April 1999, therefore, blood was refused to persons who had stayed in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
But a few years ago it was clearly demonstrated that this disease is transmitted through blood.
This incident showed us that the precautionary principle was sound".
In 1999 a much more sensitive HIV testing technique appeared on the market: nucleic acid tests (NATs), which detect the presence of the virus itself directly in the blood of donors rather than antibodies to the virus, on which previous tests were based.
The researchers say that the NSAIDs have shortened the silent period, which extends from the time when a person is infected to the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques.
We were able to reduce this period to less than a week.
This has significantly reduced the risk of some donors being infected unknowingly and untraceable.
These improvements have greatly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through blood transfusion.
Today, one person in 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
"In other words, it would take 12 million blood products to get someone infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission through a blood product occurs.
I believe that people can now feel comfortable receiving or prescribing blood transfusions to regain their health", says the head of the Héma-Québec administration.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to keep our products safe.
You never know what pathogen's gonna pop up in the system.
Not later than last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion. Like the West Nile virus, it is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We must be constantly vigilant", continues Dr. Décary, before stressing that in addition to a secure supply, Héma-Québec must also provide for a sufficient supply.
"Needs are increasing as the population ages.
Because cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need a replenishment of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also has consequences for the blood donor network, which comprises on average only 3 per cent of eligible Quebecers".
However, any healthy person aged 18 and over who meets the eligibility criteria may donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14 percent of people who donate their blood are rejected because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where malaria is rampant, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"With this 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Shortages are very rare.
But the members of this network of donors need to be renewed as they get older and can no longer donate their blood.
It is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but it is even harder to keep them from doing so and to encourage them to become regular blood donors.
"In today's hectic life, we rarely find time to spend an hour donating blood", laments Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products but also human tissue, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs, and skin that is used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which also runs the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
Once considered biomedical waste, the umbilical cord is filled with blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated the deposit of our thousandth cord blood sample a few weeks ago and we plan to collect over a thousand per year.
We should start offering them for transplantation early next year", says Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood collection program as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot access it", as Héma-Québec cannot afford to offer this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - The Impact in the Semi-Final
The Montreal Impact qualified for the USL First Division Playoffs with a 3-1 (4-3 overall) win over the Seattle Sounders yesterday in the second and deciding game of the quarterfinal playoff series at Saputo Stadium.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of play.
After a goalless first half on both sides, midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the other Montreal squad goals.
Roger Levesque was the only one to beat Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
In the first game of the round-robin series on Friday, the Impact suffered a 2-1 loss at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will face the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder closed a 3-1 deficit in the home game to win 4-3, but the Whitecaps still advanced to the semifinal round 5-4 on aggregate.
The Impact is scheduled to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In short - Kovalev's winning goal
The Canadian's number three is ready to start the season.
The team consisting of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led the offense in a 3-2 win by the Canadiens in the blocking shot against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec collected two assists, and Kovalev collected a pass in this win, the fourth for the Tricolore in six preliminary games.
Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the only goal of the shoot-out.
"I'm not ready yet", warned the Russian.
I need another game to feel comfortable".
"He tried to do too much in the first half", noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he enjoyed the end of the game.
He got a big standing ovation".
Charest set to the north
The Prime Minister does not rule out calling elections before the end of the year
As soon as the Liberal Party's general council was over, Jean Charest visited Jean-Talon, Quebec, yesterday, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to get elected in today's by-election.
'Pushing the limits of our last great northern frontier': this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force while remaining in the main lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his talk, was a projection of a kind of picture mill.
On three huge screens, spectacular pictures of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec as seen through "Google Maps", maps, and so on, were looped.
Big means like election time.
In a press release, the Prime Minister refused to rule out the possibility of holding elections this autumn, although he noted that his schedule was very busy.
The "Plan Nord" is the fourth part of a "vision" the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic area", which includes a labour agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in recent speeches by the Prime Minister, the opening of the North - the territory north of the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, merely explained why the North was "a gem with immense potential", but did not give a timetable, investment amounts or precise priority in future projects.
At most a few avenues of what could be further developed: hydropower, forestry, but especially the mining sector, which is being boosted by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds", according to Charest's list.
This "territory twice the size of France" is our home, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it in our country, it is in us", he insisted, as if to show that he was asking for a national founding myth.
He said that Quebec had built up a great deal of links with the North: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future", he added, after taking a dramatic pause to contemplate the huge map behind him.
The north, 70 per cent of Quebec's territory, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the premier said at the press conference.
"This is a traditional position that has been reiterated by all governments.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time and when the opportunity arises I reiterate this position on behalf of the government", he said.
"With climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North", he said, referring to the North-West Passage, which will be open all year round because of melting ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister feels that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the First Nations and Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially the young.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (formerly a Pequist MP from Ungava), have already started consultations with some 30 communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role, has started work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a time when "we will give each other a common vision".
The development of the North would be carried out in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be "consistent, orderly and environmentally friendly", he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as continuing with that of previous Liberal Prime Ministers.
"Like the Liberals who came before us, we have thought differently about turning challenges into new opportunities for growth and development".
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a big cocktail to mark the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the party's headquarters.
One of the resolutions adopted proposed renaming the Beauharnois Power Station into the Adélard-Godbout Dam.
"From Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who made the Quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, who made James Bay, our party has forged the future", said Jean Charest.
He also referred to another conservative reference, the "Roads to the North" programme of John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Speaking about the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Mr Charest pointed out that it was scheduled to be commissioned in 2012.
"It's between us, but I plan to be there", he told his supporters, who applauded.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of calling a vote this autumn, which the law allows him to do.
He stressed that his schedule was full, however, including a Federation Council mission to China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" that were passed as a letter to the post: the PLQ demands in particular recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and for the latter to have veto power over decisions taken in Quebec.
The opposition welcomed the outline of the Northern Plan with skepticism.
The Pequiste leader, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
She said that the Liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, had abandoned its policy.
If he had done so, "we would be more advanced today", said Ms Marois, alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (a poll taking place today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ said they support the government adopting a Northern Plan.
"But what we want is for it not to be just a show", said leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returned from holiday today.
Letters - A Land Disgraced
It was Mr Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice in the Harper cabinet, who last summer dared to say of Louise Arbour that she was a "shame" for Canada.
The shameful treatment of this woman who has fought tirelessly for justice and who deserves our admiration says as much about the Prime Minister's entourage as it does about Stephen Harper himself.
We are faced with a government which is the only one of all the Western countries involved that has not repatriated its citizen from the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government which does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager at the time of the alleged crimes.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, is breaking its word and letting a child soldier die in inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on a travesty of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
It should be recalled that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, among others, are advocating for Omar Khadr's repatriation so that he can have a fair trial in Canada.
It is the same government that turns a blind eye to torture, not caring that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever after so many years of abuse.
We do not yet realize it, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', the word Harper keeps using and which sounds so hollow in his mouth.
The time has come when there is no more morality: one can abuse, torture, imprison arbitrarily a Canadian citizen according to the goodwill of a government leader who has hitherto been a minority (what will happen after October 14...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that promotes Virtue, Law and Order, but they do not see that this government has given up what made our country's reputation and dignity.
The shame, Mr. Toews, is there, in this renunciation, and not elsewhere.
Free thought - Barrick Gold's Orwellian speech
In its September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, executive vice president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Following Orwellian logic, he claims that the world's largest gold mining company has filed a six million-dollar defamation suit against three authors and a penniless small publishing house in an effort to initiate a "transparent public debate".
While it is true that judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge the truth, especially in cases of defamation, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely obscured by Mr Garver.
Because, for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to bring to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his own?
Whatever the outcome of the trial, the authors and the publisher of the book Black Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defence and fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of the mine.
The tactic in these unequal fights is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose an amicable settlement that will gag the opposition and scare anyone who dares to look into the matter again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was in front of the public that she should have presented her view of the facts.
Unlike in many of the countries where Barrick Gold operates, discussions in Canada are normally held through the exchange of ideas and not by battering.
So all the mine had to do was open its books, its files and establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and funding independent research teams that could shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and is rejecting petitions and letters of support to Black Canada authors.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he can at the same time call for a 'public' debate and disregard the opinions of that same public.
In the vice-presidential world, it seems that the word refers only to the well-paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; that's a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democracy, even critics have a say.
What Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - is that the public who support the writers and editors of Black Canada do so primarily because they reject the brutal way of mining.
This public is ready to hear Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not in the context of what many perceive as a flag-launching prosecution (continuing the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just filed a warning to the authors of Black Canada urging them to stop using this term...).
Beyond Mr. Garver's surreal speech, the prosecution of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the pursuit of truth, essential to any democratic society.
It denies, in its entirety, the right to cite credible sources and to debate the facts and interpretations which are the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that displease the rich corporations of this world in a country like Canada, under threat of repeated prosecution, who will?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Black Canada.
She has a right to a reply.
The academic community, to which we belong, has long been able to handle debates and disagreements and to resolve conflicts.
The excessive prosecution of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, contrary to what it claims, it has no desire for a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the academic world, as it is for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place measures to limit this kind of abusive prosecution.
Wall Street bailout - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republican and Democratic, finally reached agreement yesterday on the largest economic bailout since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to curb the financial crisis that has been rocking Wall Street for months still needs to be approved by both houses of Congress.
It provides for: better control by elected officials of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of public money committed, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for default, and a right of supervision over the salaries paid to the managers of rescued companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Republican negotiator Senator Judd Gregg announced the good news minutes after midnight yesterday at the end of a two-day marathon of negotiations.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets", said Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done to protect the real economy and ordinary Americans from the ongoing crisis on Wall Street", she said.
"That's the bottom line: if we don't do that, the trauma, chaos and disruption to the daily lives of Americans will be immense", said Republican Judd Gregg.
Negotiations had been running at a fast pace in the last few hours, fearing the effect of a further failure on investor sentiment.
The deadline we agreed on was the market opening this morning.
The two US presidential candidates, who were late to the negotiations, were rather in favour of the agreement, but they did not fail to express their dissatisfaction that it had to come to this end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has claimed credit for adding certain provisions to the agreement, including the one to allow homeowners to keep their homes and the one on the salaries of executives of state-rescued businesses.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is nothing to be congratulated for.
But these measures are necessary", he said on American television.
Asked on another channel whether he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so".
"The outlines I've read [shows] that this is something that we're all going to have to digest and that we're going to be able to move forward with.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable", he said.
The $700 billion plan is to buy back with taxpayer money the dubious, risky and unsold assets of the American financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the bursting of a housing bubble which first led to the collapse of subprime mortgages before spreading to other more widespread forms of credit securities (CCS) and leading to a freeze in liquidity and the run-off of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican elected officials who had the first draft of the agreement overturned last week.
We are believed to have come out of this impasse since the Democrats agreed that some of the "toxic" assets of struggling companies should only be insured by the government, rather than bought.
To round out the corners for everyone in Congress, a provision was also added that if the government were to incur losses for five years with this program, it could introduce new taxes to help it recoup its stake.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first instalment of 250 billion, to which 100 billion may be added if the President deems it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion is expected to be approved by another vote in Congress.
In exchange for his help, Washington will get stakes in the rescued companies that will pay dividends on profits and can be resold when the storm is over.
The Federal Government will have the possibility to delay foreclosure proceedings on housing linked to the real estate loans covered by this plan and to set limits on the remuneration and severance payments paid to the directors of the affected companies.
The architects of the plan would like to see it submitted to a vote by the House of Representatives today, and by the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite their best efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will be approved.
Yesterday, there were still voices against this bill, both in the Republican and Democratic camps.
"Obviously, Washington is not listening to you", said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, to his constituents.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that is about taking advantage of the taxpayers".
As the chairman of a small congressional caucus dubbed the "sceptics caucus", Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman presents the issue differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred eminent economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us to say: we ask the Congress not to rush and to consider carefully the way forward", he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, there was once again evidence of the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for €11.2 billion (US$16.3 billion).
The intervention of the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments was necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was abandoning its acquisition of its near-bankrupt competitor after losing EUR 2 billion (US 2.9 billion) in the risky mortgage crisis in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the 20 largest European banks and 10 largest insurers.
"This is not wasted money", said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
In exchange, we get back a vote in the bank and influence.
This is something that savers and households appreciate in these uncertain times".
Meanwhile, across the Channel, the British government seemed to be in the process of nationalising another bank hit hard by the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all the loans in force at Bradford and Bringley, including more than 41 billion (US$ 75.5 billion) in real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would be the one to buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to be nationalised by the UK government since the start of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an icon committed to the cause
Her blue-eyed beauty was long her card of strength, some would say her weakness.
Had he freed himself from the narcissistic mirror, the charming American actor with the smile?
Yes and no.
His modesty, sensitivity and talent must have also kept him from the power register that gives birth to the true sacred monsters.
But what a great runner!
Paul Newman, who died Friday at the age of 83 from lung cancer at his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last iconic American film stars of the golden age.
Less monumental than Brando, who he resembled and who for a long time was a kind of screen rival, more cautious in his play, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the breaking of dramatic conventions.
Mixed-bloods often make beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
From these European roots will come one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
No over-ego, the ultimate mark of quality.
Because he projected a whole country of self-made men, of the wounded combat veteran of the Pacific War, who in the early '50s studied drama at Yale and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing in theater, television, and soon in film.
This same civil rights activist was also the driver who finished second in the 1979 24 Hours of Le Mans, doubled for a sex symbol, though he was part of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
And with it disappear the shadowy areas of this secret, discreet, committed star, allergic to the splinters of show business, whose enigma has not been fully deciphered.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
The disappearance of Paul Newman has left filmgoers dizzy this weekend, as his major roles intersect on the dark screen of memories.
More than half a century of seventh-rate American art in perpetual change is unfolding through it.
The memories of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid's charming cowboy (1969) and the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in Tennessee Williams' 1958 adaptation of Chat on a Hot Roof come to mind.
Closer to Us (1990) is about his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
So many other Paul Newman's passed down in history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Robert Wise's Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role intended for James Dean, reprised after his death, which really launched Newman in 1956.
This nice bad guy in the brilliant The Sting, Oscar for best picture in 1973.
A bitter billiard player and avenger in Robert Rossen's magnificent The Hustler (1961), he reprised the role on his return in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earned him his only Oscar out of nine nominations in 1987.
That face through the ages, that was him.
He's the one again.
The times are moving through his journey.
Young people know him best through the cult classic Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Coen Brothers' Hudsucker Proxy.
With a final role as the godfather of the Irish mob in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003, the loop was closed.
Unlike many film legends who left the business early, Newman remained in the saddle for a long time, denouncing Hollywood, its gems, its luxuries and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, not without humour, "a living challenge to 'underplaying' judging its performances too much.
The profession was not always a tender one for the handsome Paul Newman, whose roles were long overlooked.
But he played less often the first youngsters than the outcasts - the neurotic, the alcoholic, the scumbag, the desperate, whose perfect features reflected the deviations and the rebellions.
As a director, Newman revealed little-known facets of his true modest sensibility.
His 1968 Rachel, Rachel (from the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a fine female portrait of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott to an overdose, dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son to him, a work of modesty and sadness.
Among the rain of tributes pouring down on Newman yesterday was his great friend and former comrade-in-arms Robert Redford (they had starred together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) who said, with great sadness, "His presence has made my life and this country better".
Generosity, love of existence are vibrant traits of the late actor.
Beyond his legendary career, he was also a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent filmmaking, and a protester against Hollywood's excesses.
Many have seen their little girl sitting on pots of vinegar, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging the process to be rather bad taste, although it may be a gag at first.
The profits from these sales were nevertheless donated to his Foundation for Children in Need.
Newman, rather than sit on his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter that contained the following words: "Your father has always been incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there".
And it's a privilege for us to have followed the path of such a lucid and generous American artist.
Model citizen, in and of itself.
What could Zuschlag &amp; Co. make in their bill factory ?
The hearings on the ongoing criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin on 8 October.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud, in the form of a criminal organisation, on a permanent and regular basis, having caused particularly significant damage.
The prosecution argued that the money from the grants was being spent for personal purposes, while the benefits were being justified by false invoices.
The money from the State and municipalities, about HUF 65 million in total, went to the coffers of the Fiatal Baloldal movement on the one hand and to the pockets of certain individuals on the other.
Their method, also made public by the investigating authorities, was to collect the money from the grants obtained by issuing invoices for costs, behind which no actual benefit was provided and thus the associations never fulfilled their commitments.
According to the indictment, a large portion of the bills were false.
For the latter, they obtained invoice books at the Józsefváros market, while they manufactured the pills at Kiskunhalas.
The names of the companies to be included on the invoices were decided, inter alia, during the tour of the province north of Lake Balaton, carried out by István Lados at the request of János Zuschlag.
According to the witness, he was supposed to be spotting boarding houses and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he asked for an invoice, on the model of which they made the other invoices they were going to introduce, among others, to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, and the Municipality of the Capital to access subsidies.
The majority of the invoices were created by István Lados and his accomplice András Őri, who, according to our information, was mainly responsible for drawing up the files necessary to obtain the grants.
During a "scouting circuit", one of Lados' choices was a bistro.
According to two invoices issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, the restaurant catered to a group of 90 people, members of Biztos Pont Egyesület.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible for so many people to occupy the place at the same time.
Similarly, in the summer of 2002, the invoice drawn up in the name of the Jobb Jövőért foundation, which would later bear the name of Eggyütt a Harmadik Évezredért, was full of errors of form and substance.
A boarding house in Badacsonytomaj actually had only three rooms, and a maximum of ten people could stay overnight, yet the bill mentioned 130 guests.
The issuers of the invoices with their imagination also went too far when they mentioned Pigal Kft, also in the Horeca sector.
Győző Farkas, the company's manager, told hvg.hu that when the prosecutor's office summoned him and showed him the invoices, he knew immediately that they were false documents.
"Our company name and tax number were in the wrong place on the stamp".
He added: "Beyond the form, the fact that according to the bill, a hundred people stayed there, also does not fit, since this establishment has only eleven rooms, which do not have as much space.
And the bill also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time".
The fact that the European Commission has not yet adopted a decision on the application of the rules on the application of the rules on the application of the rules on the application of the rules on the application of the rules on the application of the rules on the application of the rules on the application of the rules on the application of the rules on the application of the rules on the application of the rules on the application of the rules on the application of the rules on the application of the rules on the application of the rules on the application of the rules on the application of the rules on the application of the rules on the application of the rules on the application of the rules on the application of the rules on the application of the rules on the application of the rules on the application of the rules on the application of the rules on the application of the rules on the application of the rules on the application of the rules on the application of the rules on the application of the rules on the application of the rules on the application of the rules on the application of the rules on the application of the rules on the application of the rules on the application of the rules on the application of the rules on the application of the rules on the application of the rules on the application of the rules on the application of the rules on the application of the rules on the application of the rules on the application of the rules on the application of the rules of the laws of the laws of the Member States of the European Union.
Moreover, as it appeared during the investigation, they also added VAT to these documents, whereas the benefits relating to travel activities, the destination of which is outside the European Union, are charged without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate on the four invoices drawn up on behalf of the Révfülöp Hotel at the request of Jobb Jövőért was incorrect, since the company's services do not bear VAT of 25% as indicated, but 15% VAT. Moreover, the hotel employees only issue printed invoices, while the false ones were handwritten.
The investigation of the Public Prosecutor's Office shows that the 'issuers' also made mistakes in mentioning as a service the transport of goods by road, which the company issuing the invoices could not perform, since its profile was investment advice.
In addition, it was also for defects of form, such as inadequate invoice types and false tablets, that the invoices issued at the behest of Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and of Biztos Pont proved to be false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or Kunfehértó Sports Club, both of which deny that they are the authors of the invoices issued in their name.
The counterfeiters also failed to take into account the fact that HIB Kft., established in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation at the time (in 2001) when the Fiatal Városért Egyesület group was supposed to have a meal at their house, which is why, according to our information, the liquidator of the company denied issuing this invoice.
Invoices drawn up deliberately
Another category of invoicing persons is that of those who were fully aware that they were being asked to issue fake invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták group, has drawn up an invoice for the sum of HUF 4 million to the order of the Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Foundation.
According to the indictment, the manager of Collab Kft. was induced to issue false invoices by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi.
Similarly, Biogate Kft., which is currently in liquidation and which in 2003 issued invoices to the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület and the Vörösfenyő Egyesület association for an amount of approximately HUF 5 million, but after which no benefit was actually provided, cooperated with the Zuschlags.
No financial movement took place either, as the invoices issued were subsequently cancelled, but this was avoided by the agencies in their accounts.
The next category of invoicing companies is that of companies directly linked to the defendants.
For example, the administrative representative of the general manager of Delta Trió Kft., which dealt with the fuel and motor vehicle business, and which had its head office in Budapest, but where he could not be found, was Ivan Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment, amounting to approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, these equipment were purchased by Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of this company was a Romanian-born man, to whom Iván Kubatov also allegedly sent documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
As far as we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that he issued invoices to the companies Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and that he pocketed their countervalue.
It was precisely at the request of Ivan Kubatov that Romanian masons created the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In reality, none of these companies were operating, which the defendant explained by the fact that they were not being given work.
He nevertheless made use of these companies, since at the request of Mr Zsolt Szente, co-accused and draftsman of the companies' articles of association, he drawn up invoices in their names, in the order of associations relating to Zuschlag, such as the Atlasz and Y-Generáció associations.
Kubatov gave to organizations a total of 15 invoices, issued by the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, for a value of HUF 14,2 million.
The prosecutor's office thought that 10% of the amounts shown on the invoices and the VAT went into Kubatov's pocket.
The man even used the company Szi-Beri Bt. to draw up fictitious invoices which were used in Biztos Pont's grant application.
In January 2006, the Y-Generáció Association and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted a grant application to the public utility body of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They received this subsidy for twice the amount of HUF 500 000, but these amounts were not used for the purposes indicated in the application.
To avoid this being known, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft. were presented to the TMA.
In fact, these were the same bills that were found during a search of the office of Mr. Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, a portion of the defendants will relate the method of making the invoices, as they had done before before the prosecution.
What might be really interesting is that the main accused, János Zuschlag himself, decides to lift the veil on the whole story.
So far, his confessions are not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to tell the smallest details, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or whether the Socialists have reached an agreement that in return for the repayment of a large part of the HUF 50 million, Zusi would be the only one to wear the hat.
Today, he is probably upset, since requests for his house arrest, based on a reduction in his detention conditions, are continually falling into the ears of a deaf person.
While those who have caused far greater damage and those who have committed irreparable economic crimes are walking around freely or at least waiting in their own homes for the end of the proceedings, he has no such opportunity.
The psychology of over-bidding: why do we spend more money?
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more and overpricing the merchandise.
Researchers in neurology and economics at New York University have been able to update the neurological and economic basis for this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study, published in the journal Science, humans do not want to be isolated in such a competition, such as an eBay auction, and therefore they even pay a price that is too high.
These studies have attempted to draw a neurological pattern of this kind of "game" by experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played lottery, while the other group participated in a playful auction, while using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method, researchers analyzed the active brain regions of the experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could win money, but in the auction, where a key element is the one-third surcharge, the set below the brain stem, called the striatum, would move intensively when the game was lost.
This part of the brain, along with several other functions, plays a role in the "self-stimulating" mechanism of the nervous system.
Researchers say that the reason for the price increase is that people flee the violent reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theories, the economists in this research group carried out further analyses of financial surveillance.
In these, three groups overbid against one partner, in various circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product in question and they made their bet.
To another group, they promised that if, in addition, they came out winning the game, then they would receive an additional $15 as a reward.
While the third group received the 15 dollars before the auction, but the members of the group also lost that money, in case they lost the auction.
The difference between these two groups is actually that the emphasis was on winning in one group, while the emphasis was on failing in the other.
In proving the neurologists' hypothesis, the members of the "failure" team were willing to place higher bets than those of the control group and the "win" group.
"These results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
Each of these accounts explained the phenomena observed at auctions only by the pleasure of winning and the pride in risk.
Only neurological imaging methods have helped to remove the contradiction between the two theories and now lead to a third explanation". - Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at New York University.
Hepatitis: when should we see a doctor?
Worldwide, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary chronic liver disease is listed as one of the leading causes of death.
It is estimated that there are 100 000 patients with hepatitis in Hungary, but only 7 000 are receiving treatment, because many patients do not know they have the virus.
Hepatitis is a generic name for infections of the liver caused by various viruses.
There is a lot of similarity between their symptoms, and the inflammation of the liver and the jaundice are characteristic, but the pathogens and the diseases they cause are different.
Hepatitis viruses, depending on the pathogenic genes, spread mainly in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e.g. contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
Travellers are advised to get vaccinated against A and B viruses. There is no vaccine against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after consumption of contaminated food, usually accompanied by general malaise, weakness, stomach upset, and nausea.
Then a visible yellowing develops on the skin and white of the eye, the stool becomes lighter and the urine becomes darker in color.
Worldwide, a million people die each year from the most serious forms of this disease, such as cancer or cirrhosis of the liver caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that only one in ten patients, according to estimates, receives medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if left untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients do not know they have the virus because the pathogen is subtly destroying liver cells, and in many cases the first symptoms do not appear until 20 to 30 years later.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as are regular screening tests.
The contamination is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: people who had received a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and tattooed people.
Currently, there are an estimated 200 million people worldwide with chronic hepatitis C.
Since the disease can be detected by routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult your doctor as soon as you notice symptoms of unknown origin.
The disease can be cured, if detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, thus eliminating the risk of infection and preventing the development of cancer.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, first observed in 2004 by organizations representing patients from all over the world.
Its aim is to draw attention to chronic liver cirrhosis, caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Does believing in God make you feel less pain?
According to recent research, religious belief is a kind of painkiller, which has already helped make the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
The British newspaper Telegraph reported that researchers at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment to determine how much belief in God might affect the tolerance of human pain.
In this bizarre experiment, 12 Catholics and an equal number of atheists were electrocuted while each was looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
The results show that Catholics have been able to rule out much of the suffering.
Using a technique of palpation of the human brain, it was also found that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for regulating pain.
This analysis is the first in a series of experiments involving academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians from different departments of the university.
More specifically, the experiment is carried out as follows: an instrument which emits sparks and diffuses the electroshocks is attached to the left hand of the subject.
The researchers asked the participants in the experiment to look at two paintings, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady with the Hermine painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers behind this experiment hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would evoke a kind of faith among believers, while the choice of Da Vinci's painting, not unlike the first, was about its calming effect.
The subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during that time, they received 20 electroshocks in four successive parts, while looking at either the religious-themed painting or the more general-themed one.
Catholics said that upon seeing the Virgin Mary, they felt "safe", "cared for", and "calmed down, and peace came over them".
When they saw the painting with a religious theme, they reported 12% less pain than when they saw Leonardo's painting.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself participated in the experiment, believes that you can achieve the same effect with any other strong image, in atheists, provided you find the right photo.
"We should find an image to which they react very positively, such as a mother or a father", said the psychologist.
Tom Wright, an Anglican bishop, welcomed the results of this research.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases, actually changes our personality", Wright added.
After these excellent results, the only question remains: what effect would it have on the pain regulation of the subjects if we showed the faithful a Madonna painted by Leonardo or by a painter of the same caliber?
Would seeing a better quality Virgin Mary produce better results?
You are what you reveal about yourself.
On its tenth anniversary, Google says it can be found deep in people's pockets just like the sky above their heads, knowing where they spent their holidays, which specialists they consulted, and what their interests were.
But that is not enough, says Eric Schmidt, one of the most influential people in society.
And as for the skeptics who draw parallels with Orwell's horror vision, they don't see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt told the Financial Times recently that Google's main ambition is to collect even more information about its users, which is necessary if the founders of Google are to be able to meet their original goal which was: "Let's collect all the information in the world in one system".
According to the Google executive interviewed, after ten years of global scrambling, they are still at the beginning of their goals of being able to process all the information.
Schmidt said he would like Google to be able to answer questions like "What can I do tomorrow?" or "What would be the best job for me?" However, software will not be able to answer such simple questions until it knows enough about users.
It is not entirely clear to all Internet users that the words used during internet searches, the IP address of the computer that initiates the search and the pages subsequently accessed by interested persons are precisely listed.
Through the Personalized Search programme launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own search history and can see what they have searched for, what they have clicked on. Thanks to this, in the long run, Recommendations, a programme based on the same logic, will be able to give much more personalized answers, and will submit products and services to us based on our previous statements and registered preferences.
What if someone uses my data against me, if they look at what my work is?" ask users, who are worried about Google's monopoly of information.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can provoke fear, and it is not remorse, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or possibly rebellion against power that can provoke a counter-reaction among Internet users.
It is a confirmed fact, however, that the search terms are not only recorded, but in justified cases they are passed on to a third party, and in such legal cases, nothing protects the personal rights of Internet users.
Perhaps the most striking example of recent time is the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google passed on to the Brazilian government the information it had collected on the public website called Orkut, thus allowing identification.
Human rights-conscious netizens were able to breathe a sigh of relief last May, when Google, in a showdown with the electronic legal protection organization EFF, proved its right to the FBI in court, and the ruling states that in the future, Google will still not be required by any clause of the Constitution to disclose information on the FBI's secret request of any kind.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms that it had won in connection with the strengthening of the Child Protection Act, passed several years earlier. But in the end, it failed to obtain the lists of searches by private users, nor the entire list of websites and keywords for the last two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore quite contradictory: it is being criticized by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their private sphere and their private domain suffer when they start using Google services, and therefore they attack them in the spirit of revolt against multinational companies proud of their conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its "savages" bringing together the computer enthusiasts, activists and enthusiastic users that are emerging in many countries see Google as the next generation of big business, the "fashion corporation", as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, branded as the world's invader because of Windows, even though both are fighting for the same goal.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for its applications.
The reason may also be that geeks see very precisely the problematic relationship between human rights and the internet, and what Web 2.0, the most proclaimed keyword in recent years, is pulling right behind it.
Indeed, Web 2.0 is about collaboration, about the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind us, and that we use the communication channels that are available to us, and while the dimensions of these change one by one, the essential remains the same: we expose ourselves.
A young person, in general, can keep a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and he can even link them to other services, such as Twinter, or last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then he can link them to a tracking system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also keep blogs, where their latest photo galleries that they have stored on Flickr or Picasa automatically appear.
While there are many examples, such as the girlfriend who understands easily from the morning photos taken by the circle of friends with whom her unfaithful friend spent the evening, or the company that fired one of its employees, just for the sincere opinions that the latter wrote on his blog about top management, we can be sure of one thing: the term privacy is totally reconsidered nowadays.
Who lives an online life is made up of what they show themselves, and this is how we can define the principle behind the behavior of today's youth.
Anyone who wants to hide something, or at least wants to try to circumvent Google's monopoly, can do so (starting, for example, with Scroogle, using the Google search system, but, at the same time, intentionally leaving no trace).
The number of people who deliberately do not register on public pages so that they cannot be found is not small. Google's online services, from word processing to image processing to reading information, can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not attached to huge parks of servers and which do not fit our best profile, having existed until today.
Public opinion is waiting, without really hiding it, for the moment when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion).AdWords/AdSense ad domains threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, while the benefits introduced at an increasingly rapid rate are causing serious headaches not only for Microsoft but for many other software makers.
However, critical observers find that there are contradictions with worrisome effects: for example, the company's top management has rejected, in its entirety, the protests of employees, after it doubled the price of the company's maternity wardrobe and after the company deemed the daily multiple meal service, taken at any time, too expensive. All this seems trivial in comparison to the fact that already in 2006, Google acquiesced to the Chinese government and according to the terms of their agreement, the company detects any results that hurt the good taste, as well as the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal rules is that new services are not announced until they are ready to be used. What is certain is that in the coming months and years they will move the world on new points. While some believe that Google's project of scanning and archiving books and magazines is taking on such great dimensions that the company will soon face the Supreme Court of the United States, others tremble at its health system, because in it, we can build a complete medical profit from the results of our previous analyses, our doctors and our problems.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can provide a good raw material for the next generation of science fiction writers. The novel by the famous Cory Doctorow, written with half a ton of Orwellian tones, describes a future in which a man could be approached in startling ways just through the data of Google.
Two miners helped to clear the tracks of the double homicide in Ózd
"The police summoned two minors for questioning in the case of the double homicide in Ózd. According to suspicions, they helped to erase the traces of the crime". - said the spokesman of the Borsod department police station.
The young men have admitted to the charges against them, and for now, they're being charged with complicity.
The two miners, who, according to information from MTI (Hungarian Telegraph Agency), are young girls, are defending themselves.
Conspiracy to commit murder can result in up to five years in prison.
The suspect in the double homicide in Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was remanded in custody on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicide, premeditated and self-interested.
During the investigation, it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay his debt and that is why he lured his creditor, last Wednesday, to a site in Ózd where he killed him, along with the man's little girl, aged 9.
According to MTI, the young man had premeditated his crime, and the weapon he was going to use to commit his crimes was hidden at the scene of the crime.
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange makes a bid for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered EUR 200 million, or about CZK 5 billion, for the purchase of 100% of the shares in the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, the chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal made by the Poles despite the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the State.
99% of the shares are held by the Polish State, which wants to divest itself of more than 60% of its shares within a few months of operations.
According to the Czech business daily E15, the Polish offer represents the highest bid ever made for the Prague stock exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the transatlantic Nasdaq Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have all made bids to date.
Petr Koblic, the director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among the interested parties, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner, and did not rule out the fact that this could result in the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague stock exchange is estimated by market experts to be between 5 and 10 billion Czech crowns.
On the basis of an agreement between the shareholders, some 90% of the shares would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance, with about 25 percent stakes, followed by Ceská Sporitelna bank with 14.7 percent and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the European press' point of view
In their Tuesday comments on the global financial crisis, which is worsening by the day, the leading European newspapers are already talking about a "second 9/11".
"The global financial disaster is the fault of the American president", says the Rome daily La Repubblica. "The president has not even been able to join forces with his own party behind a hastily improvised bill to help a desperate situation . . . "
Instead of a new Pearl Harbor, as billionaire Warren Buffett called it, it is more appropriate to speak of a second September 11th.
Some of the Madrid press also sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to the view of the daily El Mundo, it is the failure of political leadership there that has brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is growing every day, and subsequently the whole world will pay the heavy price.
Bush's plan was far from perfect, but according to the congressional vote, there is a real danger, that Washington does not offer a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the balance, just as one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat cannot be ignored any longer, says the daily newspaper Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states can still extend a bailout to their faltering financial institutions, and with the money of their taxpayers, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if even more banks collapse like dominoes, then neither financial resources nor new improvisations will be enough.
In the long run, we need the states of the European Union to disregard their national selfishness, and to centralize control over divided financial markets.
On Monday alone, weakened financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros, the Vienna daily Der Standard reported, adding that fears that European taxpayers too will have to get their hands on the money, much like Americans, in order to remedy the crisis are becoming more and more realistic.
The EU has so far not dealt with the crisis, which is sweeping across the old continent like a tsunami.
The 'saviors' should not be waving a hundred billion euros at once, but it would be wise if they noted in which case it would be rational to touch the taxpayers' money, with the aim of preventing greater damage.
Smart Car Imitates the Stealing of the Bumblebee
What better way to develop obstacle avoidance technology than by mimicking an obstacle detector that already exists in nature?
Like the bee thing.
In the amazing project presented at CEATEC in Japan, humming bees gave Nissan engineers the strategic starting point, to inspire them on how they should design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a mini robot car, a bio-inspired self-robot control system, type BR23C, which it has equipped with the qualities of bees, with the ultimate goal of encouraging the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
Each bee flies into its own oval-shaped space, which is actually very similar to our secure protective shell", explained Kazuhhiro Doi, director of the brand's technology research and development and public relations department.
The beekeeper's eye is of vital importance, since it can see in all directions, at an angle of 300 degrees.
To mimic the functions of the multifaceted eye, engineers have developed the idea of the laser telescope.
The radar detects obstacles at a 180-degree angle and at a distance of 2 metres in front of the BR23C, assesses the distances and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately converts it into an evasive maneuver.
The detection of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second, and then the mini-autobot, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it at an angle sufficient to avoid a collision.
Unlike any system currently in place, this avoidance is entirely instinctive.
"If it were not, the mini-robot car would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle", explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the Robotic Car Project.
It must react instinctively and instantaneously, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the protective envelope, a layer where collision is currently considered inevitable.
This whole process has to reflect what the bee does to avoid other bees.
The process must take place in the blink of an eye.
Unlike bees, the difference cannot be up, down or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction in which the wheels can turn.
So instead of the infinite combinations that bees have to avoid other bees, in our case, we could only use rotational motion, acceleration and deceleration as maneuvers at the disposal of the mini auto robot.
The BR23C uses Lithium polymer batteries which are lighter and have a larger energy concentration, which makes their lifetime longer than in the Lithium-ion version.
Andoh says it's the instinctive intelligent reaction that's paramount, not the data processing, let alone the ability to store.
This mechanism only has to process a few incoming signals per second, and react to them.
There is no need to store them and react with intuitive logic based on the data from previous maneuvers, and in this way it uses only a few dozen kilobytes of memory continuously.
We don't need memory with a gigabyte capacity, or even megabyte capacity.
This is the first step towards designing technology for instantaneous avoidance, which Nissan estimates will be introduced into mass-produced cars within the next decade.
Another application could be to incorporate it into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles in his way.
We even gave the baby a name that was priceless.
The written version of the $700 billion economic rescue plan, to buy back the dubious loans from the banks and use them in several ways, is ready.
In the first round, half of that money is going to be spent.
Reuters reports that in new debates that lasted until after midnight Saturday, local time, congressional leaders agreed on days and days of controversy surrounding the $700 billion bailout.
"We have taken a serious step forward", said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, who said all that remains is to put the agreements on paper.
The compromise, born of the plan, is supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
The US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said in commenting on the results of the compromise that the program will work and be effective, but that other measures still need to be implemented.
The written version of the plan was released before the Asian markets opened on Sunday evening at 8 p.m. local Washington time (i.e. Monday at 2 a.m. Central European time), but it did not cause a dramatic rise in the stock markets.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill that will be called the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, and then its fate will be in the hands of the Senate.
On Saturday night, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, and then the White House also welcomed the news of the deal.
"We are pleased with the progress made tonight, and we greatly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy", said Tony Fratto, the White House spokesman.
The programme also differs from the initial proposal made by the Bush administration, which mentioned that the $700 billion should be spent all at once on the repurchase of bonds with doubtful credits.
From now on, no more than half of the $700 billion can be spent. The first $250 billion will be released immediately after the law is passed by Congress, probably on Monday. That first amount will be used by the Secretary of the Treasury to buy dubious loans from banks, while the use of the additional $100 billion will be left to the President's discretion.
The programme will be overseen by an independent body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also take part.
The spending of the second half of the $700 billion is dependent on a new order from Congress.
Under the law, the Treasury Secretariat will be able to implement a combined strategy: it will be able to buy at the same time bad debts, mortgage and mortgage-backed securities and other types of 'toxic' debts.
The relevant persons of the Ministry stated that the buy-ins can take place in the context of an auction, but also directly.
The rule gives the companies concerned the possibility of taking part in an insurance programme, where the Treasury secretariat guarantees the tools that have caused the concerns, for which the companies will have paid a premium equivalent to the foreseeable damages.
Henry Paulson said the law provides the tools to allocate $700 billion for the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it be the large-scale repurchase of bad debts, insurance for them, or avoiding the risk of seeing the system collapse into one or another major financial institution.
"We will take the necessary steps to be ready for the law to be implemented as soon as it is signed", he added.
On the other hand, bad bank managers waiting for state aid can expect their start-up allowances, simply called the golden parachute across the Atlantic, to be capped by the government.
The limitation of wages is only mentioned in very specific cases, and the limitations depend on how the Treasury Secretariat offers its assistance to the enterprise.
The cap principle means that if the Treasury secretariat buys in an auction, they will take a surplus tax on the golden parachute, unless the discredited bank president retires.
Immediately after the redemption of the dubious debts, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the executives is not overstated.
To make the picture complete, it must be added that the existing gold parachutes are not modified, and the ceiling is only applied to new contracts, thus motivating participation in the plan.
This is the first time in the history of the United States that there will be legal caps on the appointments of CEOs, said the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the State acquires a right to acquire shares in the participating banks, thereby reducing the risk to taxpayers, who may even be the winners in the case once the economy and the bailed-out banks are back on their feet.
The bill states that within the next five years, the President must introduce a proposal to Congress that will determine how the losses will be reimbursed to taxpayers, starting with the financial sector.
On both sides, there were obviously those who expressed doubts about this plan.
That's not why the American people mandated us, this is not protecting taxpayer dollars, said Republican Congressman Darrell Issa of California.
Her Ohio Democratic colleague, Mary Kaptur, believes that these are the same people pushing for action as those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to rise
In August 2008, domestic industrial sales prices increased by 0.1 per cent compared to the previous month and by 12.9 per cent compared to August 2007, reports the Hungarian Central Statistical Office.
Industrial export sales prices increased by 1,1% compared to July 2008, while compared to a year earlier they decreased by 3,9%.
As a result of fluctuations in domestic and export prices, industrial production prices increased by 0.7 per cent compared with the previous month and by 3.2 per cent compared with the previous year.
Domestic industrial sales prices rose only to a lesser extent, by 0.1 per cent, compared with the previous month.
Domestic sales prices in the processing industry only slightly increased by 0.1% compared with July.
In August 2008, the most significant price increase was observed in the leather and footwear manufacturing sector (2,8 per cent), with bags and belts manufacturing first with a monthly increase of 4,6 per cent, followed by footwear production with a monthly increase of 2,5 per cent.
The higher price level of plastics and chemicals has resulted in a considerable monthly increase in the prices of the manufacturing sector of products and chemicals (1.6%).
This resulted in deflation in the oil processing sector (1.4%), the manufacture of machinery and electrical appliances (0.9%), and a slight increase in the wood processing sector (0.1%).
The prices of paper production, printing and printing activities have not changed.
The other sectors of the processing industry increased by between 0.2% and 0.9%.
In the sectors of electricity, gas, steam and water supply, which are a major factor in the national industrial activity, prices rose by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly due to the effect of the increase in gas prices introduced by the authorities since 1 July.
In a 12-month comparison, taking into account the domestic sales of the processing sector, it was the oil processing sector which saw the most significant increase (32.4 per cent).
In the manufacturing sector of metal products, prices rose by 13.2%, while in the important food, beverage and tobacco sector prices rose by 11%.
Price decreases were recorded in the textile and textile products sectors (2.5%) and in the manufacture of machinery and electrical equipment (0.3%).
In the other sectors of the processing industry, the price increase ranged from 0.6 to 9.1 per cent.
In the whole of the processing industry, prices rose by 10.2 per cent over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors were 18.7 per cent higher than in the previous year.
Among the domestic trade groups and by sectoral allocation, the sectors initiating profit on investment showed the most significant monthly price increase in August (0.7 per cent).
In the consumer goods sectors, prices rose by 0.3%, while those in the energy and further processing sectors were unchanged compared with the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month of the previous year, the largest increase was observed in the energy and materials for further processing sectors (16.8%).
In the consumer goods sectors, inflation was recorded at 6.8%, while in the profit-making sectors, it was down by 1.4%.
The export sales prices of the industrial sector, in HUF, increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared with the previous month, while they fell by 3.9 per cent over the 12 months.
In one month, our national means of payment weakened by 1.7 per cent against the euro and by 7.1 per cent against the dollar, and compared with August 2007 it strengthened by 7.5 per cent against the euro and by 15.9 per cent against the dollar.
Will we still need a visa to go to the United States next year?
Kinga Göncz believes there is a good chance that the US-Hungary visa waiver agreement will come into force around 12 January, the Foreign Minister said in Chicago, before local Hungarian community leaders.
She said that "now everything depends on when the transatlantic electronic entry and control systems will be put into operation".
The Commission has also stressed that under the new system there will be no visa requirements, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The Hungarian foreign minister will be in Washington from today.
He will meet Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will award the Commander's Cross with Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will meet with the foreign policy advisers of the presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain both support the bank bailout
On Sunday, Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major American parties, pledged their support for the government's $700 billion bailout plan, but there are some politicians who are demanding the resignation of the US Treasury Secretary.
After days of marathon negotiations, representatives of Congress and the Administration finally announced at dawn on Sunday that they had reached agreements in principle on the bank rescue plan.
This financing plan, aimed at melting down the Wall Street crisis and the crippled credit market, became the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain even present themselves, each as more qualified than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
The most recent polls show that with the emphasis on economic issues, Obama has again managed to get a bit of a head start, and McCain's head start, which he got with the nomination of Sarah Palin as a candidate just after the Republican convention, has melted.
At a campaign rally in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would quickly pass the $700 billion bailout bill.
He stressed that the proposal contained the consumer protection passages which he also supported.
"Now is the time to act responsibly ... a danger threatens your work, your economies, entire industrial sectors and the stability of the entire economy", he told a crowd of 35,000.
He did not fail to call McCain's economic ideas outdated.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: "We're all going to have a hard time swallowing it . . . but doing nothing is not the way to go".
The Republican senator said that the proposal mentioned the creation of a Treasury Audit Committee and capping the severance pay of senior executives, and that he was personally very attached to those points.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no substantive role in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Treasury Secretary.
Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House of Representatives, said Sunday that there are serious hopes that the House will vote on the bill as early as Monday.
The German-language press
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only at the heart of the party that voters have become more aware - this is what Der Spiegel, the CSU's low score in Bavaria, evokes.
Haider is ready to rule Austria, to prevent the coalition of reds and blacks.
The Spiegel (de)
In the online edition of the German left-wing news magazine, Franz Walter analyses the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The Revolution in Bavaria devours its fathers".
According to this renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took office.
The Christian Socialists have been transforming Bavaria for decades and now it is these same modern citizens who are turning their backs on them.
This change of era is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and therefore also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, the failure was not entirely a surprise, but on Sunday, a process that was likely just ten years ago was completed: the undisputed hegemony of the national party was over.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU was winning with 47.7 per cent, for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the 50 per cent level.
This happened three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, during the time of the much-touted Stoiber.
The cause of this can be attributed to the "parent-eating" modernization system, which has been consistently implemented in the region by the CSU.
Sociologists have been announcing this for 40 years but have been very wrong about the pace, but secularization, educational outcomes and the settlement of North and East Germans in the developing Bavaria region could not remain unimpaired on the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increased opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right wing is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more aware, more critical and more stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks it is precisely the groups of ordinary citizens who have moved away from the CSU, such as the self-employed, the craftsmen, the bachelors and graduates.
In these groups, support for the CSU fell to below 40 per cent.
The Commission has not yet decided on the proposal.
In its article entitled "Who? With whom? Party leaders stand on the sidelines on coalition issues", the conservative Austrian daily deals with the confused domestic political situation that has developed after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian Socialists of the SPÖ wish to discuss with the conservatives of the ÖVP.
The ÖVP forbids the SPÖ to interfere in its internal affairs.
The populist BZÖ party is open to negotiations, while the Greens are still unwilling to agree on a coalition.
The elections have taken place, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debates on public television, party leaders have barely shown their cards.
Werner Faymann, the SPÖ president, confirmed that he wished to discuss with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is indeed possible - this already exists in some regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question whether he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, as vice-chancellor, remains open on Faymann's part.
As he has mentioned, the Schüssel-Molterer guideline was in any event rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of the question.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the Reds' proposals.
As he has already said, cooperation will surely be fruitless if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
In his party, the choice between opposition and coalition membership is currently an open question, and these issues must be discussed within the ÖVP.
Jörg Haider, the president of the BZÖ, is once again open to all proposals.
"To avoid the coalition of the reds and blacks, we are ready to assume governmental responsibilities", Haider said.
Járóka said: 'We must break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation'
The European Summit on Equal Opportunities, hosted by France, as the representative of the current Presidency of the European Union, has opened in Paris today.
In her speech to the plenary, as one of the main spokespersons for the expert consultation, Lívia Járóka, MEP from the European People's Party (EPP), drew attention to segregation in education, as it is the violation of rights that most affects Roma children and is therefore one of the main obstacles to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of European legal protection and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities, are among those invited to take part in the consultation.
According to the press office of the Fidesz Popular Party group, Járóka warned that apart from the discrimination in hiring, Roma are disappearing from the labour market, primarily because of their low qualifications.
"The overwhelming majority of young Roma do not have a high school diploma, and because of poor quality of primary education, only a small proportion have the opportunity to obtain a university degree".
Járóka also stressed that education as a basic human right plays a key role in the promotion of other fundamental rights.
Investing in early education for Roma children means strengthening the economies of the EU Member States.
The MEP believes that awareness of these relationships should be raised as widely as possible, including among Roma and non-Roma.
The earlier a Roma child starts school, the greater the chances for him to become a productive member of the labour market; by the taxes paid from his income and consumption, he contributes to the state budget.
"As citizens of the European Union, Roma must be guaranteed the right to a quality education and protected from poor quality and sectarian education", said Lívia Járóka.
The Commission is also proposing that the European Parliament should be consulted on the draft directive on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the protection of personal data.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, and give Roma children the opportunities offered by democracy so that they can participate as full citizens in the future of Europe", Járóka said.
In the name of the 'European Year for Equal Opportunities for All', the objective of the Equality Summit in Europe, which has been held annually since the Berlin Summit last year, is to provide a single platform to support measures to promote equal opportunities and combat discrimination at European and Member State level.
CSU: the grace for a transitional period
The decision on the fate of the disgraced Huber-Beckstein duo will be taken in October
Despite this unfortunate electoral defeat, the heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the Bavarian CSU summit has been postponed.
The question is how long the pardon will last.
The fate of the tandem, which has suffered a catastrophic 17 per cent vote loss, will be on the agenda of the party's special congress, held on the last weekend of October.
Members of this highly criticized pair have, at any rate, made it seem that they do not particularly care about their seats.
This was used to appease the angry members of the faction and the grassroots who, one day after the "Bavarian tsunami", demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it is true, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at the height of his career - the Social-Christian Union won 60.7 per cent, whereas today, a year after the coup against Stoiber, only 43.4 per cent of their strength remains.
For 46 years, the CSU was the "sole sovereign" of Bavaria, providing 18 per cent of German GDP.
But the Conservatives still have a strong presence in this southern region, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, and in the future they will be forced into a coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal reorganization of the party, the Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture, Horst Seehofer, who was presented as the possible successor to Huber, was also given a place in this modest recognition group, which initiates tactful discussions with the liberals of the FDP, as well as with the Free Electors, formed along the values of the right, about a possible coalition in the Munich government.
A strange twist of fate was that, with the help of the Free Electors' List, Gabriele Pauli was allowed to enter the legislation, whose action against Stroiber served as a coup d'état by the Huber-Beckstein duo, and then treated the very ambitious municipal politician without mercy.
Now the CSU leadership is putting all their energy into stabilizing, one way or another, Beckstein.
The former head of the regional government and former president of the CSU, who called 28 September the bitterest day of his political career, said that the EU's political leaders had been "very disappointed" by the decision to withdraw from the EU.
On Monday, Huber made some harsh remarks to the CDU, saying that they deserved much more support from the Brotherhood.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and also to Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections in September 2009, Merkel will only be able to be Chancellor again if they somehow, with a common force, re-establish the CSU, which played an important role in the national success of 2005.
Merkel, who is hardly hiding her disappointment at the fiasco, said the loss of ground for the CSU would not negatively affect the Berlin grand coalition.
This is a relative situation, because it will not be easier to manage the injured CSU, and the crisis of the Social Democrats is still ongoing.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst result with 18.6 per cent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - his rivals: 110 - 0
No opposition MPs have been allowed into the Belarusian parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers, this is due to a country led by Alexander Lukashenko, which ensures prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is due to irregularities committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the 110-member legislature in this country of 10 million people has been very much in opposition for decades, before yesterday's elections, the opposition, uniting its forces under the name of United Democratic Forces (ODSZ), was seriously hoping that Lukashenko, renewing his term as president for the fourth time in dubious elections, following the constitutional amendment in 2006, would "allow" this time the presence of a few opposition deputies in parliament.
In this way the ODSZ abandoned its original boycott.
The fact that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia, would like to improve its relations with the EU, where because of the Belarusian political order described as anti-democratic, Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians do not receive entry visas, was one of the expectations of the opposition.
The fact that the OSCE, when assessing the campaign, focused on positive changes rather than shortcomings, such as the prohibition of standing for one third of opposition candidates, referred to a previous lull.
However, the OSCE statement on Monday already disputed the campaign, during which most of the opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and particularly the fact that the opposition could not be present during the counting of votes.
Despite all this, the opposition is still feeling a palpable improvement in the political regime: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, still refusing to recognize South Ossetia and Abkhazia as separate from Georgia.
"We have made two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue has been initiated between Belarus and the EU", Alexander Milinkevitch told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that this remains the case, despite the fact that "the government was afraid to let even one opposition member into this Parliament, which has no weight".
The opposition does not plan any protests in view of the results, but instead tries to get its message about the need for economic reforms to the voters.
"Of course, we have a lot of concerns on this side: we have to get our opposition newspapers printed in Russia, the local authorities are putting a lot of pressure on us in terms of distribution, but I can also see that they are increasingly supporting elections, even in the circle of the elderly", Milinkevitch said, referring to the fact that under the current Lukashenko regime, which considers social security as its main outcome, the most officially supported layer of pensioners no longer considers it really appropriate.
"Because of the country's debt and the rising trade deficit, the collapse of social security, 'evocating the silence of a cemetery,' is only a matter of time", says Milinkevitch.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers called the elections democratic.
Sergey Lebedev, head of the CIS mission, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People don't believe in words, but in deeds". In this way, the absence of opposition is only proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before work".
Never in the history of Chigi Palace have we had revolving doors for the entrance and exit of the employees.
But from today, this new measure is in effect against the little smart-ass, who points and then goes to drink coffee at the bar during working hours.
The new anti-laziness policy was presented today by the Minister for Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary-General of the Council Presidency, Mauro Masi.
 The revolving doors, says Brunetta, are a tool for working better, with more productivity, more attendance and more services.'
Now begins a new era of accountability and transparency.
"It is reformism", Brunetta further points out.
The installation in all the premises of the Council Presidency is completed by the Chigi Palace.
According to Masi, "the choice of revolving doors is important even from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance from employees was recorded, the Secretary-General assured: "It is a process shared by employees, and we had the collaboration of all".
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee or croissant.
Brunetta's promise, which she suggests with a smile, "a good cappuccino at 7 a.m. is an excellent and healthy resolution".
At a conference at the Ecole Supérieure de l'Administration Publique, the French government has
In the case of the Italian authorities, the Minister said that "in three months, sick leave for public employees has fallen by 50%, or 60 000 more workers in one year".
He added that it was essential to make the public administration more efficient.
The Minister explained that the Italian economy had been "doubling in terms of wage growth over the last eight to ten years compared with the private sector, and far from the inflation rate.
At the same time, thousands of public employees, have joined forces to challenge the Brunetta decree's standards by using the Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Works is now publishing data on the decline in sickness absenteeism at work", writes the Consumer Association, "the population of 'active lazy people' continues to increase.
In Italy, thousands of honest and productive public servants have joined forces to declare war on the illegitimate standards contained in the decree.
In particular, in the TAR, the exclusion of additional benefits in the event of disability due to service is disputed; the extension of the hours of the sick worker's home stay, during which the control visits are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the Minister.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: 'Prevention is crucial'
Every day in Italy, 2,500 people are injured at work, 3 die and 27 are permanently disabled.
In 2007, Inail data confirmed that the white death toll was about 1,200.
These figures show how serious the problem is. It is still one of the leading causes of death, causing nearly twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw the attention of the institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic event, Anmil is celebrating the 58th National Day of Victims of Accidents at Work in all Italian provinces, which is celebrated on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data released by Anmil, together with the tragic events of recent days, confirm the importance of the subject of prevention at the workplace", said the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the President of Anmil, National Association of the Handicapped and Disabled at Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expressed his "sincere appreciation for the ongoing association effort in favour of prevention at work, the protection of workers in accidents, assistance to the families of the victims and awareness raising"
"naturally outraged, everyone has clap their hands to put an end to such tragedies which, by their size, are the subject of media hype and public participation, even if the daily reality presents us with dramatic cases, even repeated in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that 'there is certainly a resource problem: it is essential to invest in training and information'
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector are of particular importance for a more direct awareness of the young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty to keep this phenomenon in focus, not to underestimate the alarm about the social gravity, and to apply and improve the legislative standards.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment and the environment is a step in the right direction.
The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white deaths from being impressive", said Anmil President Pietro Mercandelli.
We don't want this "discounting trend" to actually translate into a lack of attention, because it's precisely when attention relaxes that tragedy happens.
"we believe that in general, not enough is being done to counter the phenomenon of accidents and that the contrast can be made through multiple actions".
 More controls and inspections are needed, as is more work on training workers, starting at school, Mercandelli said".
- He added that further efforts were needed in terms of communication and public awareness.
"But above all, we need a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers in the face of a phenomenon which represents a social emergency".
 Mercandelli then denounced "the gradual deterioration of the conditions for safeguarding the compensation provided for victims of work" and the "deviation of assistance towards which the system has been oriented in recent years".
 The aim is therefore to give the worker the insurance guarantee  he added - so that the fate of those who have an accident should not depend on spontaneity or the extension of the legislator'
If you point at an MP3 player, you're putting your hearing at risk.
Listening to music at full volume for a prolonged period using portable music devices such as MP3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
This is the message from the European Commission, which quoted the opinion of the Scientific Committee on the unforeseen and recently identified health risks (CSRseri) in the EU, published today, in a press release issued in Brussels.
"This scientific report", we read in the footnote, "shows that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music at full volume using portable music devices, for more than one hour a day and a week, are at risk of permanent hearing loss".
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and mobile phones at full volume may unconsciously damage their hearing irreparably", says Meglena Kuneva.
"The scientific evidence shows that this is a clear risk and we must act quickly.
The most important thing is to raise awareness among consumers and make this information public domain.
We must also review existing control systems in the light of scientific opinion so that they are fully effective and able to keep pace with new technologies.'
Brussels has asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable musical instruments and the increasing number of young people exposed to the noise they generate.
'The scientists confirm that there is good reason for concern, and that the European Commission will now consider with Member States and other interested parties what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical instruments and similar devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical instruments to 100 dB, but there is growing concern about the hearing damage that could result from excessive exposure to such sources of noise.
It is possible to reduce this data by means of solutions such as reducing noise levels and exposure duration.
The EU Scientific Committee notes that users of portable musical instruments, who listen to music at full volume (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours a week, exceed the currently applicable limits for the maximum noise level allowed in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for prolonged periods are at risk of permanent hearing loss after 5 years.
This is the case for 5-10% of users of these devices, and their number can be quantified at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
The Commission has been ordered to leave Rome for the future of the capital.
Today we start, in March we finish, in June we draw the sums.
This is the schedule set by the Capitol for the work of the Commission for the Future of Rome, which took place this morning at the new headquarters behind the Thermae de Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will draw up the guidelines for Rome.
In March, when they are finished, the Committee and the City Council will evaluate the analyses and projects, in order to present the Strategic Plan for Rome in June with the 'official stamp' of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented", Alemanno stresses. "It will have to propose ideas for the development of Rome which will be of use to the political decision-makers, who remain the Committee and the Municipal Council.
No overlapping roles, but only the desire to have a corner where to elaborate a grand plan for Rome.
In March, it will have completed its tasks and then disappear, as this experiment must have a precise time duration.
In June, the mayor announced, we will present the strategic plan resulting from the work carried out by the Commission for the Future of Rome, the Capital".
To those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work the Commission will be able to do and the quality of its proposals.
If quality is there, as in France thanks to the Attali Commission, as in Rome, I am sure its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is overwhelmed by the management of the day-to-day and emergencies that arise from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look ahead, and further, towards a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future".
The Mayor of Rome also wanted to emphasise that 'this Commission is not a useless body or a bureaucratic body: it is absolutely free, and will not cost the citizens of Rome a single euro, and will be used to study and involve the best intellectuals who express the Capital.
For Alemanno, "a draft strategic reference, neither firm nor immobile, is needed to enable our city to improve, which it absolutely needs, while thinking about its future in a united spirit".
A future which, the mayor of Rome said, "will not be confined to the usual municipal boundaries, but will look further" not only in terms of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as capital, but also "in terms of the role that Rome can and must have as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president.
A prominent American politician who wants to pass for an independent wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, by his decisions, destroyed the US economy and had relations (as he still has today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam".
Attacks on Obama are increasing as the election date approaches.
A Miami woman wrote on a website: "this person is full of ambition".
Obama is a real jerk: he thinks he's going to win the highest office in a nation that has two governors and five black senators!"
In fact, these are attacks that don't say much; they are obviously racial attacks, and they don't answer the question that all voters are asking: will he be a good president?
In this case, it is still someone speaking with the heart and not with the brain.
A newspaper in Mississippi, in the heart of the southern United States, wrote an article: once in the voting booth, we know for sure who the American patriot will vote for.
Now, an aspect of the American mentality is emerging that has been kept secret until the end.
"Say what you want, we'll see ourselves to put the cross, on Obama or on McCain.
There are even people who swear that if Obama wins, we'll leave the United States.
Things never revealed before, so much so that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
Anyway, despite all these arguments, the winning card for the Democrats is George Bush.
We asked 1,500 people what were the mistakes Bush made during his tenure? 89 percent said: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was kicked back to its home country.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Yet Iraq has been, for the most part, Bush's weakness.
Whoever takes George W's place will have a huge task to accomplish.
In the United States, the economic debacle is felt even among journalists: in the press, it is the time of suppression.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about the status of their profession and mind control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists today are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not openly declare to the intelligence officers that they felt less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to.
The problem with American journalists is money, the money.
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
And the deletions in the newsroom, in the room where the editors are assembling the newspapers, are a big problem.
This is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as understood by the general public is to be reduced significantly.
A clear but complex pessimism is sweeping the American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and print-press journalists are convinced that journalism at the national level is going down the wrong path.
The local executive group is 65%.
Printed publication for broadcast.
Journalists have no problem seeing where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses are making inroads into the Internet, which many see as the "killer" of newspapers.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to using the technology in the hope that it would "do something good" for their journalism.
Today, the biggest rift in American journalism is between who runs the newsrooms - that is, the editors - and the reporters who work for them.
56% of managers nationally are convinced that reporters share their values, while at local level this percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this is linked to "safety at work".
The number of managers who think they will lose their jobs in the next three years is 47% nationally.
As far as journalists are concerned, we're going 30%.
The issue of "safe work" at the staff level in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists are working under contract.
In a huge nation like the USA, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and it quickly becomes a matter of take or leave.
CEOs are almost always paid big salaries, whereas the editor can make $10k a month, plus retirement and insurance payments.
As for holidays, the logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in total, after a certain number of years.
But, according to their revelations, American journalists are often "sick" during the year.
It's the climate.
The European Parliament has been asked to vote on the proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment.
The President of the Second Criminal Division of the Rome Court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the application of the real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who had applied to leave his hometown, Grottaferrata, for a home in Rome.
Coppola is under investigation for bankruptcy as part of the Unipol-Bnl escalation investigation.
At his trial last week, he was granted a conditional release, which was converted into compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had requested that the real estate agent be allowed to travel from the provincial city to a home in the capital.
According to the court, such trips (which the PM did not grant) would allow him to influence his society and gain access to the evidence against him.
The elites are in danger.
The phenomenon was already manifested a few days ago, with the House of Representatives voting against the $700 billion bailout plan approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and still are, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the American economy.
And it is the New York Times of yesterday that confirms this, reporting that the current crisis is dividing the Republican Party, even more divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to "those in Washington" and the financial world, powerful especially in the central and southern states.
The soul, precisely, which made itself felt in a despotic way with the vote I spoke of at the beginning.
However, what has just been mentioned is only one example of the changes, the great changes that the current economic earthquake is foreshadowing or is already allowing to happen: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and perhaps not just here.
In the United States as in Europe, the crisis seems to have accelerated the phenomena that have been covered up for some time, to the point that, in the new climate, they are solidifying and revealing themselves.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary revival, of the dual category of state and sovereign, in relation to a kind of renationalisation of the economy.
The crisis is a crisis of banking and financial institutions which, of course, have close relations with the outside world, but which, above all, are involved on a large scale, the balance sheets of individuals and families living in one country, in one state.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: how to respond to the difficulties and protests of individuals and families who are also a constituency.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically it is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalisation seems to be out of the question or, at least, has little to say: the clear evidence is provided by the European Union, which, divided as usual between the various interests and the various national strategies, is unable to decide on any common policy.
And so it is from the government of each state that everyone expects interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all a credit allocation: when you go through a difficult period, it is only the states that have the economic resources, the mass of financial resources capable of trying to put things back in place.
They also have the means and the legitimacy to use them - two resources of inestimable value, elements which no market or international organization can ever have available in an analogous way.
This new emphasis on the nation-state crisis is in perfect harmony with the ever greater importance that more recent economic developments in the economy tend to attach to a factor quite related to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had now entered the realm of the network, of ever more sophisticated technology, of the non-material, convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we suddenly realized that our future would have to settle its accounts more and more with things that are not quite material, like water, crops, oil.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth, but which are absolutely bound to a circumscribed space, to a territory.
So whoever is sovereign certainly has more cards than whoever is not, that is, whoever has the misfortune of living in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I now come to the second innovation which, however, involves a fracture.
Which means Territory, State, Government, inevitably means Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for someone who knows how to take charge of the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for the existing leadership, economic species that have proven inadequate and full of shadow zone.
And then there is something even more profound, in a sense, even disturbing: a discredit, a suffering, an image of inadequacy, a feeling of alienation that tends to involve the entire class of managers in an increasing number of Western countries.
This further increases the conviction of the various classes, before the actions are the same ideas of the social elites up to now at their peak, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have the same time, and to be ever more alien to the opinions of the majority.
In short, the demand for leadership is fuelling, in a subterranean way, a powerful and branched movement of delegitimizations of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which manifest themselves in the improvised electoral "revolts" or, in the recent changes in collective moods, from the conservative rise in Austria in Bavaria, to the fall of the Labour Party in Britain, to the rebellion of the US Congressmen against Bush (and it may well be that the victory of the right in Italy did not come by chance).
It seems that the traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, some would say, are having more and more difficulty, which is not today, to understand and therefore to represent the deepest layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis is potentially strengthening, increasing and agitating in an excessive way.
In view of all this, it seems frankly exaggerated to talk of a current "mass revolt" on the agenda.
But, as they say, keeping your eyes wide open is not without reason.
The superglue to walk on the walls.
Defeat the laws of gravity with super glue and, in the future, walk on walls like Spider-Man.
That's the goal of several research centers in the United States, and today a team of four institutes has almost succeeded.
Using a piece of adhesive just two and a half square centimeters in size, the researchers were able to hold a 100-kilogram body on a vertical wall.
THE US magazine Science published the findings of researchers at the University of Dayton, the University of Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the research team, is an evolution of the ones we know that use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The glue principle can be thought of as a series of tubes arranged like a stack of spaghetti", explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the gecko's legs, which are covered with microscopic hairs that help the animal to maintain a perfect grip.
Tests on various materials, such as glass, Teflon, and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the feet of these reptiles, and at the same time, it is easily detached from the wall", explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's Faculty of Engineering.
"This material could be used as temporary adhesive", adds Liming Dai.
Maybe it's to walk on walls like Spiderman? Maybe it is, but researchers are thinking about a much less fascinating use, like connecting electronic devices, since carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could be in aerospace engineering.
No superheroes at the moment.
OTHER RESEARCH - The University of California, Berkeley, is also engaged in research on a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society, researchers in California have developed a glue made of hairlike microfibers that cleans itself of dust when moving on a surface to ensure perfect and consistent adhesion.
Medications: never with fruit juices.
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed mainly in the summer because they are appetizing and rich in vitamins, if combined with certain vital medicines, alter their absorption, increasing or decreasing their effectiveness, with even serious consequences for health.
David Nailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, warns of the dangers of fruit juices, whether canned or fresh, if they are associated with the ingestion of certain medicines. At the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he raises a new alarm: a glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice can reduce the absorption of certain vital medicines, negating their beneficial effects and putting patients' health at risk.
Grapefruit juice has already been heavily criticized for increasing the effects of certain antiarrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, anti-stamina and neurological drugs to toxic levels.
RISK MEDICALS - The Italian Medicines Agency itself had reported the news in a newsletter dated two years ago, warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger of this combination and to be careful what they drink, if they take medicines such as Diazepam or Methadone.
DO NOT PAMPELMUSE - According to experts, even orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit medication.
The list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices is long.
Michele Carruba, head of the Department of Pharmacology at the Public University of Milan, said: "These findings are usually immediately reported to the various national and international drug agencies, which will have to change the drug information notes if necessary.
It is always advisable to read the leaflets of the medicines you are taking, and if something is not clear, do not be impressed, but clearly address the doctor or pharmacist", the expert told Ansa.
The Nobel Prize in economics is awarded to Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his research on business models and the localization of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is also a prominent columnist for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most vocal critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy solutions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, during the days of the Enron bankruptcy, Krugman wrote in an article in the New York Times that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences for the history of the United States.
A prediction that has sparked much controversy and has been blamed on economists for years, but now has proved accurate.
"I am surprised and even somewhat shocked at how quickly the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from public attention", Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the European Central Bank's executive committee, Krugman is a "high-value economist" but also a "very aggressive" whistleblower, particularly critical of the excesses of the Bush administration's liberalism.
Open Office, this is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package.
OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open source personal productivity suite, aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work by volunteer developers, supervised by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office package is being shown to the general public with various new features: from the welcome screen, and the revised and less austere interface, to other more important features, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system, and support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Open Office has paid particular attention to the interaction with the Office 2007 suite, and it is indeed possible to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting are some functions specific to certain modules, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example, to send them by e-mail, or to import PDF files into the graphics module, keeping the original appearance of the page.
On this front, it is also possible to create "hybrid PDF" documents which combine the typical graphics of Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a word processor.
The collaboration between several people is an element that has had various improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts on the modifications, in the elaboration of texts, because each collaborator is assigned a color of comments for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are even working on bringing some of the functionality of OpenOffice to the web, and in the coming weeks they should release the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.htmlet and is in addition to the English version that has been on Mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is available as usual for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can be sent to the home or workplace.
And if the theme of free can be a means of spreading it in the home, it is precisely in business, where the Open Office suite faces the great challenge, already being able to count on various projects carried out in the public administration and schools.
The Commission has also been involved in the development of a number of initiatives to improve the quality of the services provided by the SMEs.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the video writing equivalent of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for PowerPoint's rival presentations; Dbase, like the famous Access, is the program that allows working on databases; finally Drwa is the graphics module.
The target for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today we have almost 3.600 million miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version we can even exceed the planned figure.
Kohl, too, is positive, this is the fourth doping case.
Another positive case at the last Tour de France: the Austrian of the Gerolsteiner team, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and won the jersey of the best climber.
This is the website of the daily newspaper L'Equipe reporting the news.
At 26, Kohl is the fourth cyclist to test positive for the Cera, the third-generation Epo, after Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, and German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The blood tests carried out on Kohl's samples are among those carried out in recent weeks by the Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the counter-analyses confirm the positive results at the Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place in the Tour and will have to wait two years for elimination.
News of Kohl's third-generation EPO positive was confirmed by the head of France's anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who told The Associated Press he had notified the Austrian authorities of the positive.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the podium behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, winning the top-flight jersey.
Immigrants: The New York Times asks if Italy is racist
Italy "as a country of emigrants has recently become a preferred destination for immigrants" who are welcomed reluctantly.
This is what the New York Times is asking, as it has dedicated a long article to the subject of racism in Italy, starting with the case of the young man Abdul William Guibre, originally from Burkina Faso, who was killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of biscuits.
This case highlights what the New York Times calls the "paradox of the north": the northern regions are both the ones with "more integration and more work", but also" the strongest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the largest support for the Northern League".
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also referred to the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not just that.
Even the new legislature, which the Lega wants to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy.
This trend was highlighted by the Pope and by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, during his meeting with Benedict XVI at the Quirinal, asked that the State and the Church work together to overcome racism".
Students who are victims of expensive rent, up to 900 euros for a room.
The student rental market is not in crisis
According to the latest survey by Sunia, the tenants' union, renting a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached such serious proportions that it excludes whole categories of young people from the right to study because of the very high overall costs that the families from which they come have to bear", explains Laura Mariani, head of the Sunia study office. "In these cities, the high demand from students has so distorted the market that a process of generalised increase has begun for the residents themselves.
In most cases, rental offers also involve a series of infringements: free-type contracts, unregistered, no rental limit, sub-leases.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the taxation review are needed to calm prices.
If we read the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it costs about 450 euros; for a single room, we go from a minimum of 650 euros (zone Bande Nere), to an average value of 800 (zone Lambiate, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (zone Vittoria)
In Florence, a bed costs on average 350-400 euros, a room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in the areas close to the University, it costs 250/280 euros for a double bed, and 370-500 euros for a single room.
In Rome, in areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), a single bed costs about 600 euros, and a double bed costs 450 euros.
Slightly lower values (550 euro for a single) for areas close to the other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You can only save money if you move to the outskirts: 300 euros for a bed, and 450 for a single bed in the Predestina, Centocelle or similar areas.
In Naples, a bed costs 300-400 euros, for a single one, you spend 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari, for a bed, you have to count 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single bed.
In smaller towns, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they are of major importance in the city economy.
Finally, in cities such as Perugia, where rentals are often taken by non-EU students, there is a further anomaly: the rent charged to foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared with the rent charged to Italians.
Goodbye old cinema Paradiso, cities are celebrating the historic theatres.
Historic movie theaters are closing in favor of multiplexes.
"A city without a cinema is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes"
The picture, by the director Giuseppe Tornatore, illustrates well what is happening in the major Italian urban centres, but also in the provincial towns,
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the emergence of large multi-screen theatres in the periphery and the death of the mono-screen theatres in the central areas of the cities, is one of the major events that seems inevitable and undeniable to us; it also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
To disappear, they are often historical places and full of memory, "it's like a friend disappeared, someone we know, with whom we shared a bit of the way and so many emotions" observes the director of Nuovo Cinema Paradiso, a film that gave Tornatore 20 years ago, the first Oscar and the Grand Prix of the Cannes jury, and which told the poetry of a provincial hall, and the nostalgia of a way of living the cinema, lost forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main trade association, tell the whole story: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and the major cities have paid the most for the closure: 10 fewer in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 fewer in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closure, Emilia Romagna leads with 82 single-screen cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The evidence that the first cause of their disappearance is the advent of multiplex cinema, is that the three Italian regions have recorded the most new multi-screen cinemas: 195 more in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 more in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"Italy's economy has grown irrationally", says Paolo Protti, President of ANEC, "it is useful to build new structures, but it is still necessary to ensure the survival of the existing ones, because when a hall closes in a city, not all the people are necessarily willing to go to multiplexes.
Not to mention the failed deliberation of credit in favour of traders: the previous state debt is about 10 million euros.
It is a shame that, from an ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not respect the existing laws.
The support for the sector would cost between €16 and €18 million per year.
The first Italian city to address the problem, Bologna, concerned by the closures, decided to resolve the situation by signing a protocol between the City Council and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to defend and promote the mono-space cinemas in the historic centres and on the outskirts.
The measures envisaged include tax incentives for operators and mobility benefits for the public: spectators will be able to enter the restricted area, and there will be special rates for parking and in certain car parks.
"I like this initiative", says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow Bologna's example by implementing other measures.
However, it is clear that to counter the superpower of multiplexing, traditional theatres also need to improve the quality of sound and image, as today's audiences are more demanding.
The defence of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Supercinema de Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Cinema Paradiso" which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I've lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass by the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I've experienced so many shared emotions, I turn the other way so I don't see the signs blackened by the dust.
Political links to ndrangheta, arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro.
 The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to align the city council's choices with the interests of the Piromalli clan".
The Magistrates of the Antimafia Directorate of Calabria have launched serious charges against the Mayor and Deputy Mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the Mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external assistance to a mafia association.
The controls also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his grandson lawyer, the boss' namesake, already convicted of mafia-type criminal association, as well as to pay 10 million euros.
"an affront to legal and moral norms, and above all common sense", the prosecutors write, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay for consultations to Mr. Piromalli.
"This would have allowed the clan to formally enter the city councils, facilitating the already considerable possibilities of control and guidance of the public administration", the judges wrote.
The president of the Calabrian regional committee, Agazio Loiero, does not hide that there are "collusions between local committees and organized crime, there are more than one" in his region: "there are places where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressure of the ndrangheta, heroes who are honest"
This morning's arrests follow those last July, when police announced they had beheaded the Piromalli clan.
As early as the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved; already in 1991, and again because of alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been discharged from their function of administering the City.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, had been appointed head of a centre-right coalition, after the May 2006 ballot.
He cried out in scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the town council.
He accused the then Deputy Minister of the Interior, Marco Minniti, of having arranged the whole thing for a political issue, but given the request for imprisonment signed this morning, the judges explain that the Piromalli clan had even succeeded in requesting the variation of the A3 project.
From the interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the PMs write, emerged "the willingness to match the demands of a businessman, representing a more well-known group, close to the Piromalli, standardizing the choices of the public administration to the interests of the clan.
When energy comes from waves, now the big ones come.
This is a huge deposit that covers over 70% of the planet's surface and now the world's major energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, these are the new renewable resources that giants like Chevron have set their eyes on, and now they're trying to get their hands on.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movement of the sea has been studied for hundreds of years, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell in the 1980s, the idea of exploiting marine energy was shelved, but now environmental concerns and the new oil boom are giving the sector a major boost.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15% of the world's electricity needs could be met by tidal systems.
This would be twice as much as is produced by nuclear power plants.
And then there's the tides and the currents.
Colossus on the attack.
The first company to invest in marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a plant in northern Portugal.
When the deal was announced, it was a revolutionary move.
Two years later, more and more candidates from among those companies which have always been committed to traditional energy are turning to marine energy.
"Chevron is currently studying ocean-power technologies", a spokesman for a company associated with the American oil giant told the Wall Street Journal, "and is considering cooperation with us".
The cooperation in question concerns the obtaining of a deliberate permit by the US Energy Commission, which is necessary to enable a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially when you consider that in Alaska, the United States continues to drill for oil, and recently President Bush has put in place a plan for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, there are Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey, which are pursuing the sea-based energy route, and the amounts invested to date, although details are not known, indicate, according to observers, growing interest.
Technology to be improved.
Experts say the technology is still in its infancy, but the fact that marine energy is not doing away with concerns about its environmental impact.
At present, systems like those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small in scale, and do not seem to be causing a major problem to the ecosystem.
However, to produce energy on a large scale, technologies with a higher environmental impact must be used.
And the choices are varied: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys that are connected to each other.
The wave thrust, which moves the mud up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure from the pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure turns a turbine, which in turn, powers a generator.
Power is sent to shore through undersea cables.
Right now, we have four such systems in the design phase, pending a single federal approval, and some of the energy could go to a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces power for a shopping mall and a parking lot using six underwater turbines from New York's East River.
The movement of water during tides, turns the blades of the turbines, creating a rotary motion that powers a generator.
Verdant announced that he had a long list of customers waiting for the necessary permits to draw power.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say at the Institute for Electrical Energy Research, is the potential of tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, tides are more predictable than wind, sun, or waves, and thus more reliable as a source of energy.
And it's precisely on tidal energy that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others, are looking to the coast, investing $7.5 million in 2008 and planning to invest up to $35 million in 2009.
