UN chief says there are no military solutions in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the nearly five-year-old conflict and more weapons would only exacerbate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a conference on Wednesday that he planned to meet this month with foreign ministers from five permanent members of the council - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly ministerial session to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed regret that the divisions in the council and between the Syrian people and regional powers have made this situation unresolvable.
Ban called on the five permanent members to show solidarity and unity when they succeeded in reaching an agreement on Iran's nuclear weapons, thus addressing the crisis in Syria.
Eight numbers from polls that show Donald Trump has a real shot.
Some tried to label him a flip-flop politician.
Others called it a joke.
And others are waiting for implosion.
But no matter how some Republicans try to take Donald Trump off the top of the polls, it hasn't worked (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump leading by a double-digit percentage and some voices are beginning to seriously question what that means for the real estate mogul's chances of being appointed.
Of course, it's still too soon.
None of this is saying that Trump will win the race for the Republican nomination.
Pundits shows that during the same period in 2011, Rick Perry's lead over Herman Cain in the polls, but neither of them won in any state in the nomination race.
And the reasons why they'd fight hard in the general election are many.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth admit Trump's power and start backing him with money.
Here are some recent poll numbers that suggest the real estate mogul is not just a passing thing:
The numbers that indicate support for Trump have turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a poll by Monmouth University showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive opinion of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, the percentage had risen to 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Right now, six out of 10 Republicans have a favorable opinion of Donald Trump.
About three in 10 say they have a negative view.
These figures are holding.
A poll last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa concluded that 60% of Republicans in the region have a favorable view of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy if Trump won the nomination race.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67% of Republicans said they would be either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump won the nomination.
Only two in 10 say they would be "upset" if Trump won the nomination.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% say they would be "enthusiastic" versus 40% who say the same about Trump).
The closest in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters say they would be "displeased" or "disappointed" if their favorite Jeb Bush wins the nomination race.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temper as an issue.
Although Donald Trump has been heavily criticized for his insults and bombastic style, 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide think the real estate mogul has the temperament to be president, according to a poll Monday by ABC News/Washington Post.
We're seeing the same numbers in Iowa, where 52% of Republicans think Trump has the right personality to be president, according to a poll last week by Quinnipiac.
However, 44% think he lacks the personality to act effectively and nearly six in 10 independents say his temperament is not what the White House wants, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When I take the intellectual side, Republican voters think Trump is authentic.
According to a CNN/ORC poll last week, when asked who had the best chance of winning the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump.
The situation changed from late July, when four out of 10 would have bet on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: In the past, GOP voters have not read the future very well.
During the same period of the last election, four out of 10 Republicans voted for Rick Perry in the race for the nomination, compared to just 28% for Mitt Romney.
But these numbers show that a majority of GOP voters consider Trump's campaign plausible.
Even if the Republicans are backing down to another candidate, Trump is still ahead of everyone.
Some rumors say the divided situation will likely contribute to Trump's victory, while support against Trump will split to more than a dozen candidates.
But a poll conducted in early September by Monmouth University shows that in the hypothetical scenario of a collaboration between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always have the majority support.
Trump is 13 points behind Carly Fiorina, 14 points behind Marco Rubio, 15 points behind Walker, 19 points behind Jeb Bush, and finally 33 points behind Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
He's almost on par with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would beat the businessman by 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one contest.
Most of Donald Trump's supporters say they've made up their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that more than half of voters who support Trump say they won't change their vote.
Obviously, a lot can happen in this regard and no one can say that they will never change their minds.
46% say they leave the door open to change their choice.
However, Trump's most important opponent is currently neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but he is twice as likely as voters to declare that they have decided to vote for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapists" in his campaign opening speech two months ago, immigration has been the central theme of his 2016 campaign.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombastic style will lead to a split between important Hispanic voters and the Republican Party and will hurt rebranding efforts.
But according to an ABC/Post poll Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So, it seems that as long as the immigration issue remains in the spotlight, so will Doland Trump.
Frustration with the authorities is reaching new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by almost half of the Republican voters, largely due to their outsider status.
According to the ABC/Post poll Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they prefer a political outsider to someone with experience in government.
People are also angry at the authorities in Washington.
A poll conducted two weeks ago in Iowa by the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with the performance of Republicans in Congress, with 54% saying they are "dissatisfied" and 21% "nervous at the top".
Jeremy Corbyn makes his debut on Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut at PMQs has been long-awaited
The new Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, will later make his debut on Prime Minister's Questions, facing David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of the six questions he is entitled to shortly after lunch; his performance will probably be closely scrutinized by the media and Labour MPs.
During his weekly appearances, he demanded "less drama and more facts".
It also stated that it can give up some holdings and that it is transferring them to its colleagues.
The standoff will be Mr Corbyn's first parliamentary test as leader, coming after he called a "ghost cabinet" and after his speech at the TUC annual congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to remain silent during the singing of the national anthem at a service on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain drew criticism from some Conservative MPs and made headlines.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "respectfully remained silent" and acknowledged the "heroism of the British Air Force in the Battle of Britain".
But a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC's Two's Newsnight programme that he would have recommended the Labour leader sing the national anthem 'regardless of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished'.
Around a dozen ministers in the shadow cabinet refused to join Mr Corbyn's leadership team, citing differences of opinion over the economy, defence and foreign affairs, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
The BBC's political correspondent Robin Brant says that policy differences are "gathering" in the Labour Party after Mr Corbyn's appointment over his stance on the European Union and the benefit cap.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that the Labour Party would make changes that would eliminate the idea of limitation entirely.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, the Minister for Work and Pensions, stated that the party is very clear in its exclusive opposition to the government's plans to reduce the level of the headcount from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to face David Cameron in the stands in the last decade since he took over the leadership of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to policy, says he has ideas from outside sources for questions to ask Mr Cameron and has received over 30,000 suggestions.
Islington North said PMQs were too confrontational and that he would refrain from retaliation and attacks, pledging to focus instead on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the finance minister, will take his place at PMQs when he cannot attend - for example when Mr Cameron travels abroad.
He also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to speak on occasion, saying he had approached Speaker of the House, John Bercow, to discuss the matter.
In 2005, when he took over, Mr Cameron said he wanted to abandon the Punch and Judy style of politics often associated with PMQs but admitted a few years later that he had failed in his endeavour.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, PMQs have been considered a key barometer of a leader's reasoning, how he leads the House of Commons and his standing among his fellow MPs, although critics say it has become a caricature and needs deep reform.
 Joburg picture: homeless youth benefit from photography courses
It's hard being a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who had lived on the streets as children found a way to learn a trade and earn a living.
I was shot in Joburg is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people how to take pictures of the areas where they live and make money from it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.
JD Sports boss says higher salaries could hurt expansion
JD Sports president Peter Cowgill says an increase in the UK minimum wage could mean 'greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers'.
However, it is unlikely that this purchasing power will outweigh the higher labour costs within the firm, he argues.
The costs could impact JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by the president of Tennis Australia, Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves to be praised and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was a collateral victim in the storm created around her friend, Nick Kyrgios, and her behavior deserves more praise than criticism, in the opinion of Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger half of the talented duo often called Special Ks,, was unpleasantly dragged into the spotlight by Kyrgios' scandalous skydive against Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a heated qualifying match played shortly after in Cincinnati, the bench referee had to intervene twice to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after which Harrison stated: "Wawrinka should have grounded Kyrgios, and I should have grounded this kid".
Although he was last seen making a rocket-powder after having muscle cramps and missing a possible US Open, upset at Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was defended with firmness by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, where he is battling Sam Groth for second in the singles after Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against England.
"One thing I feel strongly about is that, in my opinion, Thanasi has been drawn a little into the conflict", Healy said.
The truth is, he broke a rocket when he lost because he had cramps in the US, but he's not the first player to break a rocket out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he wouldn't be proud of that.
But let's be serious, he's handled himself extremely well in pretty challenging situations in the US with Harrison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of trust.
He's got a great team, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated unfairly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works hard and he's integrated into the team, he hasn't had any conflicts with the other players, he's very respected in the locker room, he's training hard, he's in excellent shape, he's a very balanced and mature young man and I think he deserves to be judged solely on his qualities and flaws.
Healy also supported the decision not to consider Kyrgios for the important draw, which starts on Friday, and described the 'joint decision' as the right one for everyone, but supported the return of the Canberra native for the long term.
"First of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the tiebreaker and not think about the controversy surrounding [Kyrgios]", Healy said.
And I think Nick has risen very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have said, he's growing up in the public eye and he's made some terrible mistakes and he deserves to be criticized, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and I think he needs some time out of the spotlight to be able to reflect, which is good for the team and good for him.
2016 election: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders has been cut in half in national polls
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still has a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the national nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of Democratic voters (down from 58%), while Sanders is in second place, with 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, is backed by 15% of Democratic voters.
With at least five months before the primary election, most Democratic voters say it's too early to say they've decided on the candidate they'll support.
But Clinton's supporters are more adamant in their choice than supporters of other candidates.
Compared to the CBS News poll last month, Clinton lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders gained a few percent.
Clinton retains the lead among women and moderates, but the lead has narrowed.
Support among men has dropped considerably and Sanders is only five points away.
Clinton's lead among Democratic voters under 50 has evaporated, now tied with Sanders.
Yet Clinton still leads the way among the senior voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders by a double-digit percentage of the Liberals, but Sanders now has a slight five-point lead in that group.
About half of the Democratic voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were elected to run for the party.
A quarter would support it somewhat reservedly and another 15% would support it simply because they represent the party.
Six percent wouldn't support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the odds of Clinton's current supporters being enthusiastic about her election are high.
Opinions are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would support her enthusiastically.
While 48% of Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the number of Republican voters saying the same about top-ranked Donald Trump (35%) is smaller.
When Clinton's supporters are asked an open question about why they would want her to win the race, the majority answer is that she has the right experience (16%), followed by the fact that it's time for a woman to be president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
The agreement on these aspects and eligibility shall also be mentioned.
Given that the vice president is considering a possible presidential run, 57% of Democratic voters would like to see him in the race - although a third think he shouldn't run.
When asked about the second choice for party representative, Democratic voters are calling Biden the majority.
Of Clinton's supporters, more than half say Biden would be the second option, well ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run in the Democratic primary, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders increases from 20 points with Biden running to 30 points if he doesn't run.
55% of Democratic voters consider Clinton the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; but the numbers are down from 78% last month.
Biden is far behind in second place but the percentage that says he's the most eligible has gone up.
However, when asked what's most important about an elected candidate, Democratic voters prefer problems over eligibility.
As in last month, no Democratic candidate or potential candidate is considered by these voters to be unacceptable as the party's representative in the presidential race.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates do well in terms of a few key characteristics compared to their party's primary voters.
Most voters see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as integrity and trustworthiness and as having solid leadership qualities.
Biden is seen as the best of the three in terms of integrity, while Clinton's strong point is leadership.
30% of Democratic voters do not think Clinton is trustworthy or trustworthy, twice as many as those who say so about Sanders (15%), but 27% do not have an opinion about him in this respect.
Democratic voters also generally think that the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, have the same ideologies as them.
On all of these issues, about a quarter of the Democratic voters don't have an opinion about Sanders.
With questions persisting about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and server while she was Secretary of State, most Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the subject and say it hasn't affected their general opinion of the candidate.
But things are different among the American public.
Half of the Americans are now unhappy with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion was divided on the issue in March, shortly after the issue came to light.
Most Americans say the email controversy hasn't affected their general opinion of Clinton, though 36% say they've changed their opinion in a negative way.
Mostly Republicans, more than six in 10, say they've changed their minds about Clinton in a negative way.
Although Democratic voters consider Clinton to be trustworthy and upright, this issue continues to raise concerns among voters in general: only 32% consider her to be upright and trustworthy, 8% less than last month and 15% less than in May.
62% of voters don't consider it to be trustworthy.
At the same time, 55% of voters nationwide do not consider Trump to be trustworthy and integrity.
Yet both Clinton and Trump have white balls for leadership.
Of the six candidates evaluated, Biden, Carson and Bush rank first in terms of integrity.
The number of people who think Sanders is a good person is greater than the number who don't, but like Carson, many people don't have an opinion about him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.
Five fraternity members charged with the murder of a first-year student at Baruch College.
Nearly two years after a college student lost his life during an initiation ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people have been charged with murder.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity at Baruch College in New York City brutally attacked Chun Michael Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and delayed taking him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, according to police statements.
Officials say the victim was blindfolded, had a 40-pound backpack full of sand put on his back, and was repeatedly shot as he tried to head for a target on icy ground.
Mr. Deng reported headaches and passed out.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity did not call the emergency number after he passed out and claimed they would have waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, police say.
But they found the time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the national fraternity president, for advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a news conference.
At this point, members began to hide personal belongings and put the good of the fraternity before the good of Michael Deng, Wagner said.
He couldn't be resuscitated and died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated injuries to his head, trunk and thighs.
"Too many families have been devastated by fraternity rituals, since 1970 at least one student has lost his life every year because of the rituals", Douglas Fierberg, Deng's family's lawyer, said in a statement.
The brothers and their members must be held accountable and this action by the authorities is important.
The grand jury of Monroe County has recommended that the first five members be charged with third-degree murder.
Thirty-two other members of the fraternity, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with assault and accessory to murder.
"We want to hold not only the people involved accountable but if there is an organization that has authorized the fraternity, officially or unofficially, we will hold it accountable as well", Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the fraternity and the national fraternity withdrew its affiliation with the local chapter.
Here's what's going to happen when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.
The interest rate will rise and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will rise and the economy will enter recession.
That's what we know.
What we don't know is how soon it's going to happen and how long it's going to last.
In economics, history offers little clue as to the timing.
After the first rate hike, the recession occurred in just 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve's aggressiveness in raising interest rates is often, though not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
That's why U.S. central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when the interest rate starts to rise but on the time trajectory for normalization.
There are indeed multiple variables at play.
However, in the end, market players might find that all the excitement around the interest rate increase was exaggerated.
"The Fed's first interest rate hike since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a sign of the era of 'cheap money,'" Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to more normal but still low levels to be the seismic shock that everyone seems to fear.
But you can't say there won't be any effects.
Here are how several sectors of the economy might react, based on historical trends:
Given the situation the market has faced in recent months, the anticipation of an interest rate increase may volatilize things for a while.
But at the point of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
"There appears to be a tendency for capital returns to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first increase, perhaps reflecting again the monetary policy shift", analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a recent study on what will happen after the Fed increases.
More specifically, over the last 35 years, the market has risen sharply - by around 14 per cent - heading towards a rather unchanging rate rise over the next 250 days (average rise of 2.6 per cent) and then returning to normal after 500 days, with an average return over the last six cycles of 14.4 per cent, according to a recent analysis published in Barron by the chief strategist of Nuveen Asset Management.
Deutsche stated that the impact on shares tends to become more pronounced later in the interest rate growth cycle and the benefits start to decline.
Recession is a fact of life, but rising interest rates often contribute to it.
In the current situation, the Fed is facing conditions that have not existed before and that could accelerate a recession.
Specifically, gross domestic product will approach its historic low for a Fed interest rate increase.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 interest rate increases since 1950, only twice has nominal GDP been below 4,5%.
The Bank of England's capital adequacy ratio is currently at the lowest level in the country.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the amount of the aid.
Market players have been preparing for a Fed increase all year, with all eyes on this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends on Thursday.
Although many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC may approve an interest rate increase at this meeting, forward trades indicate a probability of only 25%.
"In our study from 1950 onwards, all interest rate growth cycles up to now have been in a super-profit growth cycle, with GDP eclipsing pre-recession peaks very quickly after the start of the recovery", the report said.
On the contrary, it was a strangely slow recovery from the worst recession in the period analysed.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has expected since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and it has reached 74 months and continues.
Fixed income was also volatile as the market anticipates an increase in the interest rate and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster on bonds than on equities when the Fed changes policy.
In the case of bonds, it appears that the benefits change direction as soon as the first up/down in the cycle occurs.
At the end of the interest rate growth cycle, the yield on bonds immediately decreases, Deutsche said.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the amount of the aid.
High yield bonds do better in such an environment, although 'we are still cautious about forcing yields', said Kathy Jones, a fixed income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones is of the opinion that the markets have already adapted to the Fed's policy expectations.
"Besides the strength of the dollar and the fall in estimated inflation, there are some signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy", Jones wrote.
Short-term interest rates have gone up, the yield curve is straighter, the average loan interest rate spread has widened and volatility has increased -- all market characteristics when the Fed adjusts policy.
In general, companies with a majority of their business in the USA will benefit from the interest rate increase and local products will become more attractive.
Multinational corporations with high debt will suffer because the rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the global marketplace and their debt will be more expensive.
"History shows that 'quality' stocks tend to be more profitable in the three months following an initial rate increase", Goldman Sachs analyst said in a report to clients.
Firms with strong balance sheets outperformed those with poor balance sheets after each of the interest rate increases of 1994, 1999 and 2004, by an average of 5 percentage points.
The companies with high capital receipts and with low volatility stocks also outperformed similar companies with lower quality, averaging 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt is going to be a big deal.
Companies with a high percentage of floating debt have the most to lose, Goldman argues.
Consumers will also benefit from the growth of the dollar.
Savers could also gain, although experts disagree on how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham has criticized the station for "lying"
It claims to be increasingly similar to its commercial rival
He also took a look at the BBC Music Awards, claiming they plagiarized the Brits
My colleague Damien Collins has attacked The Voice, claiming that this show isn't original either.
BBC Radio 3 is turning into Classic FM, a senior MP said, putting pressure on the station to prove it does something commercial stations don't.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC that the public broadcaster was "lying" and increasingly resembling its commercial rival.
"I feel like Radio 3 is lying - I don't like to use the word - but I feel like it's becoming Classic FM", he said.
He also took a look at the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, launched last year, seem to be British under a different name.
So if you try to do something different -- these are the two examples that come to mind that just copy what's already on the market, said Mr. Bingham.
The BBC's CEO denied the allegations, saying that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival in terms of live music and public education.
I'm not gonna find out about classical music anywhere that I hear from Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production is unrivaled.
"In addition, I think it's also important that Radio 3 is committed to discovering new music and allocating new tracks", he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 editor Alan Davey said he needed to do more to attract listeners than the previous period because Britons have less knowledge of classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only BBC item criticised at the Culture, Media and Sport committee meeting for following in the footsteps of its commercial rivals.
Conservative MP Damien Collins has attacked The Voice - the talent show bought by the BBC from Dutch producer Talpa Media for around £22 million.
You understand why there's often a discussion about that show because it's not original and it doesn't stand out in any way?
Lord Hall insisted that the show produced by BBC1 - with Paloma Faith and Boy George on the judging panel - be produced in a BBC-specific manner.
He added that he wants the corporation to find the golden egg chicken in its own fence the next time it launches an entertainment show.
However, he refused to ban future seasons of The Voice or spend the money going into licensing other entertainment formats.
Online sales have recorded the lowest growth in August and Black Friday may be to blame
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
Last month saw the slowest growth since 2000.
Online sales really took off three years ago, thanks to the use of mobile phones to shop.
Experts believe that Black Friday in November could be a factor in spending reluctance.
For over a decade, online shopping has exploded and turned the UK's shopping streets into ghost towns.
However, experts say there are signs that online sales are declining, with the latest figures indicating an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
Total money spent in August showed the smallest increase since 2000, with an increase of only 5% in the last year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are declining, with the latest figures indicating an increase of just 7% in the first three months of 2015.
"If you look at the level of growth in previous years and go back to 2000, there has always been a tendency to rationalize over time", Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales took off three years ago, when shoppers began using mobile phones to shop.
So, the number of people who could shop online and could do it in various circumstances, like from the couch, grew.
But now that it's stagnating a little bit, you might see a decline.
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
In the opinion of experts, shoppers would refrain from making purchases before the event which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of shoppers crowded into their computers to get their hands on deals, which led to the collapse of several retailers' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when shoppers were fighting over their spending power, could cause reluctance.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium has determined that at least £1 of every £5 is spent online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than one third of purchases are currently made through online shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion stores in the commercial areas.
After sanctioning the Bin Laden family, Muslims bury victims killed in the collapse of the Makkah skyscraper
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were paraded through the streets by Muslims, with the first funerals taking place in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia has partially blamed the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group for the collapse.
The Health Minister said that a total of 394 people were injured in the collapse of the shed
In a street march ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims killed by a crane collapse at the Great Mosque of Mecca.
Dressed in white, mourners joined the road to express their condolences, until the first dead person reached the end of their final journey at Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
The sad memory of the holy site, where just a few days ago a construction crane collapsed through the ceiling of the mosque, falling on the faithful.
The bodies were released for burial after the King of Saudi Arabia sanctioned the Bin Laden family construction group for the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
In a ceremony in the street, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims killed by a crane collapse at the Great Mosque of Mecca.
Among the victims was the father of four, Qasim Akram, of Bolton, Great Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was in the Great Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual Hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, with thousands of pilgrims still arriving in the city.
Today, King Salman declared that the Binladin Group should not have left the crane's arm up when the crane was not in operation.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press Agency, stated that the Binladin Group was partly to blame for the collapse.
The English-language service of the news agency did not provide details, but said that the company's leaders were banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the collapse of the mausoleum in the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims have come ahead of the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
The Binladin Group has not yet made any statements on the collapse of the shell and the Group representatives could not be contacted for statements.
The Royal Decree blamed the group for not using up-to-date safety measures and not coordinating its work with the meteorological authorities.

The advantages and disadvantages of converting loans into Swiss francs
Two offers for converting loans into Swiss francs into lei have already appeared on the banking market, the main advantages being the exclusion of foreign exchange risk and the reduction of interest rates.
The disadvantages may come a few years later, when variable interest rates may lead to higher rates.
The Bank of Transylvania has just completed the process of converting the loans granted by Volksbank into francs, and Bancpost has announced the conversion offer for its own customers.
According to data compiled by analysts of the financial portal FinZoom, Bancpost offers three years of fixed interest rate in lei, 1.5%, the lowest on the market.
On the other hand, the conversion offer of Bank Transylvania was accepted by 83% of the customers with loans in francs due to two successive reductions: the balance was reduced by the amount of risk and administration fees paid by the customer, then an additional 22,5% reduction was applied to the balance in lei.
Both offers reduce their own customers' rates from their monthly equivalent payment in lei before conversion.
Thus, Banca Transilvania reduces the rate by 42,5% and Bancpost by 33% in the first three years and, theoretically, by 18% in the following years.
Benefits
The main advantage of converting loans into CHF in lei is that the currency risk is eliminated, the consumer is protected from future increases in the franc, and the loan is repaid in the currency in which he earns his salary.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that no re-evaluation of the property is required, no additional collateral is required and no other proof of income is required.
In practice, there will be no new financial and legal analysis of the loan, nor will there be any additional costs as in the case of a refinancing.
The Commission also notes that the Bank's own shares are not included in the total amount of the loan.
The risks
The problem is that the rate in the early years is more of interest, and the client pays very little of the principal.
Bancpost's offer of very low interest rates for the first three years seems to be beneficial to the customers.
It is not known how this interest rate will develop after three years.
The margin offered to customers may be higher than 3,25%, so overall, and the cost reduction is lower.
A possible risk for all loans in RON with variable interest rates is that the ROBOR index will rise significantly in the coming years (more than the Libor-CHF index).
For example, ROBOR at three months is now 1.44%, but in 2013 it had reached 6%, in 2009 it was over 15%, and in a few days in 2008 it was over 40%!
In addition, other costs may arise which were not mentioned in the initial tender.
The time has come for the US Federal Reserve to make interest rate decisions.
The world's eyes are on the meeting scheduled in two days, Wednesday and Thursday, when the US Federal Reserve will make the crucial decision whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in about a decade.
In a Reuters poll of 80 economists, just over half of those who last week thought the decision would be made now believe that the situation will continue for a while and that interest rates will be kept in the current range of 0-0.25%.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Federal Reserve brought rates to zero.
For the first time, we are facing a situation where a major central bank could abandon the zero rate and initiate a process of normalizing interest rates, said Angel Ubide, chief analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has performed relatively well, with the recovery bringing trillions of dollars to the balance sheet and generating low inflation.
But the Federal Reserve must not ignore the global less rosy situation.
He warned the markets to prepare for a rise but there are signs that even they believe such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced on Tuesday, 20:00 CET.
Stars who lost their charm
The actor (left), along with his son Redmond (right), have been through stressful situations in recent years.
In 2001, he battled leukemia and in 2009, he lost his life partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
The actor is also rumored to have faced drug problems and in 2008 was arrested for drug possession.
All of this certainly comes at a cost.
Manchester United player Luke Shaw is out for a few months with double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture in his right leg in Manchester United's Champions League match, which ended in defeat to PSV Eindhoven.
After the tear-jerking event that will keep him on the bench for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The accident came after a reckless intervention by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute, after 20-year-old Shaw broke PSV's defence.
He was medically treated for nine minutes on the ground and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double fracture in his leg and is in hospital".
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after tomorrow and then he'll be operated on in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18, he gets in trouble, then he plays fantastically and now this is happening.
He was put on an oxygen mask in the locker room.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but the double fracture rest is six months and he won't play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
It seems Moreno was lucky and got away with a red card and a penalty kick.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian official was wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say it's a fault and a red card.
It was a very ugly, two-legged intervention.
A message on Shaw's Twitter account: "Thank you all for the messages, I don't have words to express how weak I feel, I'm starting the road to recovery, I'll come back stronger".
Manchester United hit by Luke Shaw's injury in PSV defeat
The England international has one more reason to recover to play in the European Championship in France next June.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said: "It's a very ugly injury.
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an injury.
Our players never aim to injure an opponent.
Moreno broke his leg playing for Mexico against Van Gaal's Netherlands national team at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very difficult for him because he didn't intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear that it's a very serious injury, it's not good", Cocu said.
I didn't see the stage.
I could only see the ball, which was going in another direction, so it looked like [Moreno] touched it but I couldn't see the intervention on Luke.
In a statement to SBS6, Moreno said: "I know what it's like, I know how difficult it is to go through something like this.
I feel really bad, I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado also arrived at the hospital after an intervention by Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth has clearly risked England's omission but he's still holding his own.
Winning against Pakistan in the UAE is a difficult task but after seeing the England team selected for the tournament, I don't consider a repeat of the 3-0 defeat in the Test matches.
I wouldn't rule out any possibility of a win on the move.
Alastair Cook's team may be less experienced than they were three years ago, but they have good players on the line and the morale is strong; they will not be affected by the events of 2012 but will have a positive youthful attitude.
Moeen Ali is evolving as a spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the testing level, is an option for attack.
Similar topics: Adam Lyth left the England team for the Tests and was replaced by Alex Hales
Obviously, as his head coach at Yorkshire, it's difficult for me to analyze the decision not to select Adam Lyth for the team.
He played all seven Test matches against two good strikers in tough conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricketers are judged by the results.
There was no question mark on Joe Root, for example, until the announcements were made because -- and I said this before -- the players are their own selectors.
Some fifty years and Lyth might have extended his run but his fate is in his hands.
I hope if he makes more runs for Yorkshire he will get other opportunities.
The head coach of the England team, Trevor Bayliss, has praised his attitude even when the performance was not up to his potential, and that doesn't surprise me; first of all, he's a team player.
It's hard to answer the question of how long does a batsman make in test matches.
Lyth had seven runs -- like Sam Robson before him -- while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton was lucky at home and on the road.
The only regret you can have is that England preferred Jonathan Trott to the Caribbean tour - when Lyth was at his best - but that missed opportunity is a thing of the past.
We're gonna have Alex Hales on the team, a batsman I'm very good at.
He's a cricketer who has the X-factor and we noticed him early in Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us at a Trent Bridge pitch.
He should be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors but this will of course depend on the composition of the UAE team.
The idea was pitched that Moeen would open the batting alongside Cook, which would lead to an extra spinner while keeping four quicks, and I don't mind.
I don't see why a pitcher couldn't hit there and this lefty has already proven himself to be a total fuck-up.
Moeen may not have brought success to his home county, Worcestershire, but he was number three for them, so the difference is not great.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 Test matches, 38 as a first drop before entering the Open in 2001.
He immediately erased three centuries and never looked back.
Zafar Ansari is coming into the team as a back-up spinner and although I had limited contact with him, it struck me that he is a very impressive young man.
People might judge his young age -- 31 batting average and 35 balls -- and they might think he's a point guard, but there's not a lot of spinners and the selectors have opted for youth.
He's gonna learn a lot from this tour.
England have made some changes to the coaching staff as well.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lankan batsman, as the consultant for the Test matches could be a master stroke.
He's one of the best players and he's going to bring a lot of experience, given that he's played in every situation and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood is coming for the white-ball leg of the tournament and will bring both energy and relentless ambition.
I always thought he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether as a player or a coach, and like Mahela, he has intuition.
Sometimes, new voices in the locker room, even if they're conveying messages that have been conveyed before, can bring fresh air to the team.
Colly Durham's coach, Ben Stokes, is resting for the one-day games, Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and coaches don't make the program.
And you have to remember, the players' jobs depend on the results they get.
Decisions like this are never made lightly.
The Brexit camp could win the case if the economy stays calm until 2017
As the day goes by, David Cameron's renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU gets more and more muddled, even without the choice of the genius Jeremy Yes or no? Corbyn to lead the Labour Party or TUC brings on Tuesday serious criticism of Europe.
Foreigners have characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained the other day that - immersed in crises similar to the EU's - not all of them being internally provoked - some member states are being fed the UK's agenda of concessions and treaty changes, which the majority do not want.
At the annual meeting in Brighton, the TUC decided that they did not want to do this either if it would erode social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George's selfie diary.
The prime minister and the chancellor attend summits or bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and declare that they have gained allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants a Britain with an outward view under the EU roof - "Don't leave us alone with France", says Berlin - suggests that many ministers and obtusen officials in certain capitals have reached the point where they don't care whether they stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the cautious German chancellor, is an ally but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave before her situation falters, as happened with Thatcher (11), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who stayed too long.
In 2017, the French president, François Hollande, will be re-elected or replaced.
And his power is in decline.
Poland could soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain a left-wing one.
It's hard to believe that they'll help the English posing, whose energy would be better spent preventing Scotland from leaving the UK - something they don't want either because most have similar separatist tendencies.
So some ministers might even plan to make unhelpful, SNP-style remarks in the 2017 UK referendum campaign to hasten the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
'The renegotiation was fixed and the UK gained nothing of value from the renegotiation.
Europeans know firsthand how overwhelming Fleet Street can be and how skeptical the oligarchic press barons are who look at the EU with skepticism because they did not participate in the 1975 Tony Benn-inspired referendum which ratified our 1973 accession at the ratio of 2:1.
Perhaps they vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the Euro-opportunist who became famous in the early 1990s when he was the correspondent for Brussels.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the mix of tax-exempt bagpipers, strangers who cheated by phone, and pseudo-non-homes who own most of the major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair saw them in much the same way, but he realized that when you're locked in a cage with a nervous gorilla, you have to give him bananas to distract him from eating you at lunch and again at tea.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposing Cameron's referendum idea, given that Blair made a principled concession to the abandoned EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who gave him an exit card.
The press didn't forgive him for that either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who touched me on the back of my neck at Westminster on Monday - I told him not to waste his time with me - seems to be in danger of adopting the Murdoch boycott strategy of Neil Kinnock from the '80s, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy of cooperation with the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr whose position at the BBC left him vacant on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what I would indulgently call evolution.
He says he would like us to remain in a reformed EU.
Most people who don't agree with the conservative Anglicism might agree with that.
That's what Hilary Benn, but not Bennite Benn, said on radio and TV this week, when the scout in him struggled not to acknowledge that Corbyn's appointment of John McDonnell as shadow finance minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the '70s when his father fought on TV to be disloyal to his Labour colleagues without going too far and without losing his cabinet post.
Hilary's fight was more appealing.
But the fight to stay 'in any situation' - Benn's expression - does not correspond to what McDonnell said and what JC said to colleagues and MPs in the private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever image Corbyn wants to convey - remember, he sensitized me too - the discipline of messaging remains important in the age of television and especially in the whirlwind of social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a ticket to Europe, allowing him to take Labour's support in the referendum campaign well, as McDonnell has argued.
Simon Jenkins certainly believes that.
But McDonnell and Corbyin's basic sophistry about EU membership - in keeping with their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just an esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents for whom narcissism of small differences is a central dogma.
As with his sophistry about NATO - Tom Watson is adamant that JC will not campaign for resignation - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste the political capital - and there are suspicious voters - on concessions to Britain when all could be useless?
The US is already pretty disappointed in the British's poor military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a Conservative government cutting costs, as I was reminded at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticize the decision of the Department of Public Health in England on e-cigarettes
According to the researchers, the claims of a government agency that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking came about after a meeting between 12 people, some of whom had ties to the tobacco industry.
Experts from the editorial team of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet in criticizing the evidence used by the Public Health Department (PHE) in England in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the benchmark report last month and described it as a complex analysis of the evidence.
However, some researchers have questioned the robustness of the data and pointed to links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in the Lancet medical journal attacked the "extraordinarily fragile basis" on which PHE based its main conclusion.
Two other researchers writing in the BMJ questioned the claims and their foundation on solid ground or moving sand.
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on evidence of effectiveness.
They stated that they expected the PHE's claims that current estimates show that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking to be based on a detailed analysis of the evidence and models.
In fact, a single meeting with 12 people led to the development of a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) model to summarise their views on the negative effects associated with different nicotine-containing products; the results of this meeting were briefly presented in a research paper.
McKee and Capewell or stated that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was said to have received funding from British American Tobacco in the past to conduct an independent study.
It also validated the public health accreditation of BAT in a sustainability report, it said.
They added that one of the 12 participants in the meeting reported funding received from an e-cigarette manufacturer but not the funding reportedly received from the cigarette and tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The arguments on the basis of which the panel members were selected were not provided but they include a number of known 'front-runners' in the e-cigarette industry, some of whom even state in their paper that they finance the industry.
Other participants in the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the tobacco control section of the PHE.
The research work of the group "convincingly conceals" the lack of "sound evidence of harmful effects of most products under most criteria", McKee and Capewell said.
However, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell stated that the PHE's claims that 'there is no evidence to date that e-cigarettes are a factor in encouraging smoking among children or non-smokers' are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of the PHE health department, says that he has responded to the claims in the BMJ in the past.
He stated: E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking
One in two people who have smoked their whole lives lose their lives to this habit.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are comparatively minor, but we need to continue to study the long-term effects.
The PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about the information that is and is not in evidence, in particular in view of the high degree of public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Each year, about 80,000 people die from a smoking-related disease and the annual costs to the national health system from smoking amount to £2 billion.
By making clear the current evidence - that while the use of e-cigarettes is not without risks, they only present a fraction of the harmful effects of smoking - we are fulfilling our national duty.
Illegal torture equipment - delivered to your door!
The ads that shame Britain's arms trade
Watch the film made by Amnesty International against the arms trade.
The terrible killer drones!
Beasts for the crushing of ankles!
Dispersion bombs! What are you doing?
And electric batons that cause terrifying pain without leaving a trace!
The cheerful voice and animated images leave no doubt that this advertisement for the world's largest arms fair is a harsh charade, made by Amnesty International to underline the British authorities' desire to sell arms to repressive regimes through Defence and Security Equipment International at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.
In the arms trade, authoritarian regimes are coming to London.
But a separate campaign also led to a large number of posters in bus stations and subways that need a second look.
"Important announcement, traveling with DLR between 15 and 18 September?" says one of the ads, using the fonts and branding of the London Underground, the DLR line transforming into the image of a tank.
In September of this year, a lot of arms dealers will storm the DLR. Customers are being asked to help stop the arms trade.
The 300 posters are made by artists who exhibited at the Cruel Designs Museum in Dismaland, Banksy.
A group called the Special Patrol Group has helped distribute in London using Ad Space Hack Packs, a £6 package of Allen keys that they claim facilitate access to about a third of the advertising space in bus stations around the world.
The London Transport Authority is not amused by this vandalism in the form of flyers.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly asking questions and seeking to make political work accessible to the public outside of galleries.
Many artists are moving toward collaborating with activists in protest movements, realizing that they need to get out into the real world for their art to have an impact on society.
Another poster against the arms trade welcoming the commuters traveling by subway.
The Amnesty film had over 100,000 Facebook views in 24 hours and was created by the VCCP advertising agency who worked pro bono, and the graphic designer and voiceover artist also worked for free.
The creative director of the VCCP, Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence surrounding the arms trade advert - with a blank space in the ExCel calendar - and thought "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid".
They played around with making a more realistic commercial but enriching it with animation and strong colors was more striking.
"They did a great job helping us to raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair", said Tom Davies for Amnesty.
Now, the UK authorities need to take action and make sure that torture equipment is not illegally traded and delivered to the door.
Perhaps the most creative art form on the subject of the arms fair comes from inside ExCeL, where exhibitors offer fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab disclosed an order received from the US military regarding the AT4CS RS with shoulder-mounted launcher.
This includes a uniquely shaped focus that delivers stunning effects behind the armor, inside the target.
Whatever that means, it's not gonna be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in the home
It's been 11 years since I moved into the home, when I was a 19-year-old young man who still believed in glass and moral relativism, but I can only now remember the forced smiles of those I irritated - and the many complaints about others.
Most of what I've learned can be summed up in the form of eight simple rules.

Don't suffocate people.

David Grimal: In the time of Bach, there were no world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were working people, artists, not business people.
The French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our time, known not only as a soloist but also as the initiator of a less ordinary, "strange" project, as he calls it, Les Dissonances - an orchestra of international soloists and talented musicians, performing a symphonic repertoire without a conductor, which makes it at least a curiosity in the classical music landscape.
Les Dissonances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two performances: one on Sunday, with David Grimal, the orchestra's founder, as soloist, and one on Monday, with Xavier Phillips in the foreground, with Enescu's compositions intact.
Both shows, on the Athens stage, showed the audience a different way of interpreting classical music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004 being, at the time, the only classical music ensemble in which there was no conductor.
The conductor is the most important musician to musicians.
It's true, on the one hand musicians need an education either to become soloists or to become performers in an orchestra -- I'm talking about instrumentalists, not composers.
They are trained as "specialist workers".
They themselves feel they need a conductor.
On the other side of the stage, for the audience, all the musical fetishism is centered on the conductor.
And so the business, the music industry, does its marketing.
So we're not talking about music anymore.
So if you look at this world, you have on the one hand skilled workers, which is stupid, and an audience that can't listen, but has to watch, which is stupid", David Grimal considers.
The violinist says that this change in his music came as a result of "musical deceptions" in his solo career.
I was like a high-level athlete who had to do the same exercise all over the world with different bands, to make a lot of money and bring money to the music industry.
Ten years ago, when I was in my 30s, I found this very depressing, because I was no longer finding creativity and human fraternity in this system.
So I don't see any point in continuing down this road.
So I decided to create Les Dissonances.
This is happening in 2004, and at that time nobody was doing this without a conductor: "The music world, extremely conservative, did not want projects like this".
"How do I imagine marketing a collective of musicians who no longer have egos?" asks the artist.
David Grimal acknowledges that Les Dissonaces is "a luxury", stating that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra depend on the success of this project to live.
In the 10 years of the ensemble's existence, the lack of a conductor has not proved to be a hindrance to the musical act: "Curiously, the more complex a repertoire we play, the simpler it seems, because all the musicians are obliged to be present in the opera and not just in the role", says Grimal, adding that at the Sunday show "we had 74 conductors on stage".
In Grimal's opinion, the Enescu Festival is "very brave", precisely because he invited Les Dissonances: "An extraordinary festival, where the largest orchestras in the world are present and play 3 times a day, and in the middle of these orchestras you invited this strange group".
In a temple of orchestral tradition, like the Enescu Festival, there is room and interest for something different, that breaks barriers.
Speaking about Enescu's work, the violinist admits that he feels the Romanian music of the famous Romanian composer, so he did not need a special approach when he introduced works by Enescu into his repertoire.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, but that's what happens when we talk about George Enescu and Romanian music, "because there's also a George Enescu who did French music".
Grimal advocates changing the way classical music education is done, believing that "the profession of musician as it is organized today is on the verge of death" and that "the future of music is music itself".
We don't need to go around the world five times a year if it's no use.
In Bach's day, there were no world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were working people, who were artists, not commercial representatives.
For me, organizing concerts, festivals, touring, releasing albums, all of them are awesome, extraordinary, but as long as they're done in the service of music.
If not, we're in a system where creativity suffers, it doesn't have freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave an example of Romanian products before and after EU accession: "In Romania, before you joined the EU, you had good vegetables and meat".
To enter the EU you had to pass sanitary laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
Production and agriculture are being taken over by supermarkets, as is happening in France.
The same thing happens with music, it's the same logic.
Les Dissonances makes reds not very pretty, but when you cut them, they're real reds.
In an ideal world, this music should be back at the center and the institutions and industries that run this system should understand that music doesn't need to be sold, it needs to be shared, and that can be done starting with education policy.
"If we consider - as the Koreans, the Chinese, the Japanese do - that Western music is one of the most beautiful things in humanity, we would reintroduce it in schools, we would reintroduce concerts on television, and through this education we would no longer need to sell musical by-products", Grimal believes.
Certainly, there are things in classical music education that remain very communist, that everywhere, is something very militarized.
It's up to this discipline whether we compare a musician to a soldier, or whether we train a musician who will play an instrument, being, first of all, a musician.
We're talking about a completely different kind of education, if we want to train a soldier, it has to be one way, if we want to train a musician, it's a completely different kind of education.
In your opinion, which is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?" asks the French artist with a smile.
Grimal points out that, for artists, the reward of another way of making music comes precisely from overcoming this "soldier" status, overcoming what "they think are their limits": "Musicians discover at some point that they are not soldiers, and that is why after a concert they come out smiling".
David Grimal spoke about his musical project and his vision of music and the artist in the "Festival of Ideas", a public discussion organized within the International George Enescu Festival by the Aspen Romania Institute.
This is David Grimal.
After attending the Conservatoire National Superieur de Musique in Paris under Regis Pasquier, during which time he received advice and encouragement from renowned artists such as Schlomo Mintz and Isaac Stern, David Grimal studied for a year at the Ecole des Science Politiques in Paris before meeting Philippe Hirshhorn, who changed the course of his life.
David Grimal has an international career as a solo violinist, during which he has regularly given concerts for the past 20 years on the world's major classical music stages and with prestigious orchestras such as the Orchestre de Paris, the Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France, the Russian National Orchestra, the Orchestre National de Lyon, the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, the Berliner Symphoniker, the New Japan Philharmonic, the Orchestre de l'Opera de Lyon, the Mozarteum Orchestra Salzburg, the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra and the Warsaw Symphony, under conductors such as Christoph Eschenbach, Michel Plasson, Michael Schnwandt, Peter Csaba, Heinrich Schiff, Lawrence Foster, Mikhail Pletnev, Rafael Andhbeck and Peter Evos, and Christian Nilsson, Arne.
He was the recipient of works with dedication from several composers, among which were Marc-Andre Dalbavie, Brice Pauset, Thierry Escaich, Jean-Francois Zygel, Alexander Gasparov, Victor Kissine, Fuminori Tanada, Richard Dubugnon, Ivan Fedele, Philippe Harrowing, Anders Hillborg, Oscar Bianchi, Guillaume Connesson and Frederic Verrieres.
Aside from his solo career, David Grimal has kept exploring more personal projects.
The freedom that his collaboration with Les Dissonances afforded him allowed him to develop his inner universe by venturing into repertoires not accessible to solo artists.
Along with Les Dissonances, he founded "L'Autre Saison", a series of concerts given in the interest of and with the homeless at the church of Saint-Leu, in the heart of Paris.
Since 2008, David Grimal has been Artist in Residence at the Opera of Dijon.
He taught violin at the Musikhochschule in Sarrebruck, Germany.
He also holds many master classes and was a member of the jury of the International Long-Thibaud Competition in Paris in 2010.
He was awarded the Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres by the French Minister of Culture in 2008.
David Grimal plays a Stradivarius, "ex Roederer" from 1710, as well as "Don Quixote", a violin designed for him by the French lutenist Jacques Fustier.
David Grimal was present on Sunday at this year's George Enescu International Festival with Orchestra Les Dissonances, featuring Debussy, Enescu and Beethoven.
Les Dissonances also took the stage on Monday, this time with cellist Xavier Phillips in the foreground, and the program was composed of Schnittke, Enescu and Brahms.
Cinema City is looking for "Little Big Voices".
Cinema City launches the biggest challenge for kids: playing two characters from the blockbuster "Snow Queen 3D"
You have a super-talented, spontaneous child who likes movies?
Give him a chance to become a star.
In September, as part of the newest campaign for enthusiastic and ambitious children, eager to become future stars, and aged 8 to 16, Cinema City is looking for "Big Little Voices", offering them the extraordinary opportunity to voice two characters from a famous animated film.
If in classic cartoons the emphasis was on the approximation of the voice of the actor to the specific character of the cartoon, lately, when creating the story, the people who are going to interpret the voices are also taken into account, and they are usually very well-known actors.
Cinema City Romania wants to discover new voices and that's why we're launching a new campaign.
We want to find the right voice and challenge parents to enter their children in our contest.
They're going to have a special experience, because the characters are nice and the lines are funny.
"The kids will have fun and will have a real chance to be part of a team of actors", said Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania.
In the first stage of the competition, from 11 September to 30 September, Cinema City organises a pre-selection where 10 children (five girls and five boys) will be selected and given the opportunity to give a rehearsal in a recording studio alongside professionals.
All parents need to do is access the micilevocimari.cinema-city.ro platform, where they can register their child for the contest and prepare him for the voice test.
Then they have to choose one of the four movies available on the platform, download the texts that the child is going to read and then the child will record himself playing his own dubbed version.
Four films about friendship, fairy-tale heroes, magic and hope can choose the contestants to support the challenge: "Yellow Feathers 3D", "Mune: Guardian of the Moon 3D", "Blinky Bill: The Koala in 3D" and "Maya Albinus 3D".
Finally, the most talented two children (a girl and a boy) will see their dream come true and will double each character in the superproduction "The Snow Queen - The Snow Queen 3D", which will premiere in Romania in November this year.
FedEx earnings are mixed, lower fiscal forecasts for 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter, with the delivery giant cutting its full-year profit forecast as a result of low demand for transport services and increased costs for its ground transport division.
The company also stated that it intends to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
At the same time last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The company's shares fell about 2.5% in pre-market trading, 45 minutes before the opening bell sounded on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it expects to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending May next year, 20 cents less than an earlier estimate.
Analysts were expecting $10.84, according to a FactSet poll.
The falling estimate comes despite an average price increase of 4.9%, with effect from 4 January, and higher surcharges for the land transport of large or heavy parcels, which will apply from November.
The company stated that it still expects profits to increase compared to the previous year as a result of lower costs, higher revenues and the development of e-commerce.
President and CEO Fred Smith stated that the firm is facing a considerably weaker economic situation than expected, in particular in terms of production and global trade.
The holiday hiring plans were announced a day after competitor UPS said it planned to hire 90,000-95,000 additional workers, about the same number of jobs it did last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6% from the prior year.
Earnings per share were $2.42, below the average estimate of $2.44 per share made by 12 analysts who responded to the Zacks Investment Research survey.
Profit increased by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts who took part in the Zacks survey estimated the sum to be $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit by a decline in priority international transport in recent years, which has led to a stagnation in the revenues of its Express unit.
But the explosion in online shopping has boosted the results of the FedEx Ground division.
In the last quarter, the revenues of the ground division increased by 29%, but the operating revenues practically stagnated due to higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded an increase in revenues due to higher basic tariffs, while the freight division's revenues decreased due to rising costs.
At the pre-market trading, about an hour before the opening sound, FedEx shares had fallen by $3.85, or 2.5%, to $150.15.
Tuesday's closing was down 11% year-on-year and 17% from the record high of June 11.
In the most anticipated meeting in years, Federal Reserve policymakers will spend two days this week around a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table to decide whether it's time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Above them, at one end of the central bank's boardroom, you'll see a mural of the United States.
The map is meant to remind that Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chair, and her colleagues must put the nation's economic interests above everything else.
The central bank has been given a dual task by Congress: to maximize the employment rate in the U.S. and to maintain price stability.
But since the Great Depression, Fed leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
And this third task could be the X factor in a decision that is too difficult to anticipate, which will be announced on Tuesday, and which will determine whether the US economy is ready to be unleashed by the unprecedented stimulus provided by the near-zero short-term interest rate in effect from the end of 2008.
Even though most data points to a strongly growing economy, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could scare off already cautious Fed officials from adding volatility by raising the federal funds rate - even by just a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the first and main issues they will be looking at", said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
'I think that if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the interest rate, the growing uncertainty in the world market is enough to give them reason to wait,' she said.
There is no consensus on the decision the Fed will make, which in itself causes instability in the financial market.
About half of the economists recently surveyed by Bloomberg anticipated an interest rate increase this week.
But the financial markets expect the Fed to postpone a key indicator showing that the probability of growth is only 30%.
This would indicate a drop in the stock market if the Fed raises the interest rate, unless policy makers soften the blow by promising it would be a long time until the next increase.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The surge was triggered by expectations that Fed policymakers will keep the interest rate stable this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be surprising if the Fed raised interest rates at this time", Lonski said.
If the Fed's decision makers did this, they would have to act in-depth in their policies to avoid panic in the financial markets.
Other experts said that an interest rate increase would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed would act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed about to raise the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step towards a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that she expected an interest rate hike this year despite objections from liberals that more economic progress was needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, labour market growth was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest rate in more than seven years and close to the level the Fed considers as total employment.
Wage gains showed signs of growth.
And although inflation continued to fall short of the central bank's annual target, Fed policymakers said a key reason was the temporary effect of plummeting oil prices.
The economy is facing higher rates and needs them, given the strain on the labour market, said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But global financial markets began to vibrate later this month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 16% below its record high in May, as investors feared that the slowdown in the Chinese economy would drag down global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now about 10% below its May high.
For Fed decision makers, market turbulence is added to the complex calculation of the momentum of the interest rate rise.
"Without what happened in the financial markets and the news about the weakening Chinese economy in recent weeks, they would be firmer at the meeting", said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior research fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Fed official.
Now, he predicts they'll wait at least a month to better manage the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the US economy and they have almost no data to base themselves on after the events in China", Oliner said.
The well-being of the global economy is not one of the Fed's major interests, so it should basically not be taken into account in decision-making.
But in reality, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.
In recent years, the central bank's influence has been enormous.
The mere hint by then-President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed might "tighten" its monetary expansion triggered an earthquake in markets worldwide.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly entangled, it is expected that Fed officials not only monitor progress in other areas, but also consult with other central banks and experts to better interpret the world economy.
His decision-making is "more art than science", said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy at the well-being management firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., said this month that the Fed has a history of overreacting to changes in the financial market that seem to have no bearing on the economic fundamentals.
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Commission, the decision-making body that supported the interest rate increase, gave as an example the decisions of 1998-99.
A financial crisis affecting Asia led the Fed to reduce the benchmark rate by 0.75% in three meetings, despite the implications for U.S. development that could be identified only in limited ways, Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials reversed those cuts.
The Fed should only put financial stability first in the event of a major crisis, such as the 2008 market quake, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate-setting committee.
The last turbulent period is nowhere near that level, he said.
"We certainly don't want to be in a situation where we fear an interest rate rise because the markets are upset", said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and doesn't mention financial stability, and until something changes in that regard, I don't think it should take any premature action.
Looking for a great market with Thai specifics?
Try the LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/deposit opened/opened in 1997 belongs to LAX-C Inc.
Often called Thai Costco, LAX-C is a Thai high-end market that sells to the public.
Yeah, it's in Chinatown and not Thai Town.
The market/depot is a universal store offering an astonishing range of fresh, frozen and dehydrated products, Thai and Asian popular snacks and kitchen utensils, furniture, religious and festive decorations.
There's also a car wash where you have to buy some engine oil.
The store is huge and it takes at least an hour to go through all the hallways.
If you get hungry from so much shopping, eat at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The store's indoor food court (good, affordable) is close to homes and offers more options for preparations that can be taken with the package.
Do you need anything--any--Thai?
You probably find it at LAX-C.
The products are reasonably priced and some items are sold wholesale.
Fresh products include herbs, fruits and other Asian and Thai products.
The meat ration is big, and so is the fish ration -- the staff that serves will clean and fillet the fish and even fry it for you if you want.
A large part of the store is dedicated to the huge freezer area, where you will find curry leaves, frozen melons and ginger, whole ducks, fish, blood and beef balls, pork carcasses, fish steaks, traditional, semi-prepared sausages and much more.
Who buys from there: Restaurant owners and chefs, as well as families and individuals.
The wide corridors are suitable for both shopping carts and forklifts.
Discovery: fresh durian fruit right next to the houses.
Where it is located: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles, on the outskirts of Chinatown and Downtown - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own shared parking area with other shops and restaurants.
Although the store is likely to be crowded, parking is usually not difficult to find.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the polls, despite attempts by Channel Nine to broadcast on the Today Show about the change in party leadership
The urgent move of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to report on the consequences of the changes in the Liberal Party leadership did not bring a significant increase in the audience for Today.
The morning show on Channel Nine was broadcast from the capital after Tony Abbott's defeat to Malcolm Turnbull.
The rival show Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was captured in London as part of a series of broadcasts over the course of several weeks that also included Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This 'cruise' of distance didn't seem to matter much to Aussie TV viewers, with Sunrise having an audience of 397,000 in the five capital cities, compared to Today's 339,000.
Today recorded a slight increase compared to the audiences of Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000) but the numbers were lower than those of last Thursday (343,000).
Today has shrunk the gap from Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, Today averaged 318,000 and Sunrise 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far, in September, Sunrise has an average audience of 349,000 and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
This morning, it is not only Parliament that is affected by the current of change!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for asking!

The big news was the stunning debut of the 800 Words series starring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama, about a recently widowed father who decides to move with his two children to the coast of New Zealand, had an average audience of 1.219 million.
Critics wondered if Thomson was capable of doing a solo show without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The hearing results for last night answered resoundingly yes.
The X Factor show on Seven held its position with 1.136 million viewers, taking the lead lightly over The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven recorded highs and lows on the second night he broadcast The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30) of the new general culture show moderated by Andrew O'Keefe averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) climbed to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's show, Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia averaged 520,000 viewers and the second half recorded a whopping 720,000.
The average audience for "The Stole Seat" was 620,000.
The drop in the Chase Australia's ratings on the second night will give the Nine tacit confidence that Hot Seat will finally triumph at 5:30.
The Chase Australia replaces Million Dollar Minute, a show that failed to beat McGuire's show.

Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested at gunpoint at an airport in Siberia.
Because he openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company, Yukos, was confiscated and his pro-democracy efforts were diminished.
4 people lost their lives after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets at a crowd demonstrating against the country's proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday night in Rupandehi district, about 280 km west of the capital Kathmandu.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the district police chief, over 1,000 protesters gathered outside a police station, and some of them threw stones and Molotov cocktails.
Mr. Dhakal claimed that the police forces used tear gas and then fired shots into the air before resorting to the use of rubber bullets.
According to him, twenty police officers and five civilians were injured.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are usually used as a less lethal alternative, caused so many deaths.
The clash was the latest event after weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern region, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say the new provinces created under the new constitution would dilute their political influence.
Protests have also been held in western Nepal, where the Tharus ethnic group wants its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in the violent clashes that began on August 10,
When four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a major step towards a new constitution but a highly controversial issue in Nepal, a centrally governed country for hundreds of years.
The process of drafting a new constitution began in 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
This week in Kathmandu, lawmakers voted on the draft constitution and officials said the new charter could be adopted on Sunday.
We're not gonna use wire fences, dogs, cops and guns.
The Prime Minister continues to exchange remarks with the Hungarian authorities.
At the opening of the Government meeting on Wednesday, Ponta reiterated Romania's firm stance on the refugee crisis.
We're doing everything we can to manage the refugee crisis, all the institutions have a coordinated opinion.
Romania does not agree and will not apply anti-democratic measures, guard dogs, wire fences or police with guns.
'It is a shame for 21st century Europe to apply the methods of the 1930s,' said Victor Ponta
"The Prime Minister also said that all the dates and details of the refugee crisis will be discussed and established at the CSAT meeting on Thursday".
NHC reports 60% cyclone probability south of Cape Verde
A broad low-pressure front about 350 miles south of the southernmost tip of the Cape Verde Islands has a 60 percent chance of turning into a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure front about halfway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent chance of a tropical cyclone forming in the next two days, the Miami meteorologist added.
Weight-loss surgery could be useful for mildly obese diabetics
The benefits of weight-loss surgery in mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes could be sustained for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still premature to say whether mildly obese diabetics live longer after weight-loss surgery than those who are on nonsurgical treatments.
"It takes a long time to centralize mortality data", said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a specialist in obesity surgery, who wrote an article about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight-loss surgeries, also called bariatric surgery, use various methods to shrink the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proven effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted in morbidly obese individuals with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or greater.
BMI, a unit of measurement of weight in relation to height, is considered normal in the range of 18,5 to 24,9.
A BMI of at least 25 indicates that a person is overweight and people with a BMI of over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI by going to 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy - in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in mildly obese people.
The average BMI of surgeons decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of the study.
Meanwhile, the BMI of people who received non-surgical diabetes treatment remained close to the same level, at 29.
Of those who had surgery, 36% and 28% had partial diabetes.
In the medically treated group, by comparison, only 1% of the subjects had complete and only 2% partial diabetes recovery.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and LDL cholesterol control were generally better in the surgical group, the authors concluded.
The researchers also monitored the blood level of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
The researchers write that the optimal hemoglobin A1c level is below 7%.
After surgery, the mean haemoglobin A1c level decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
But in the treatment group, it remained at about 8 percent.
But this improved glycemic control - reflected in improved hemoglobin A1c levels - did not reduce the five-year mortality rate, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average outcomes associated with the two types of surgery.
At the fifth year, compared with the sleeve gastrectomy group, the bypass group lost more weight (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), had more significant decreases in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and had a higher probability of complete diabetes remission (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of overweight people in Sweden that surgery prolongs life, says Blackstone, of the University of Arizona, School of Medicine - Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who had bariatric surgery were about 29% less likely to die after 15 years, compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a survival benefit in patients who had surgery, Blackstone said it is optimistic for people with BMI under 35 interested in the procedure.
"This is where this paper is critical, because it says that this surgery is safe in the lower BMI group", she says, "without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease".
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start taking weight seriously when the patient's BMI reaches 27-30.
'I think we're waiting too long to get people to take this seriously,' she said.
I think once they've accumulated these genetic changes that have shorted their bodies and made them prone to obesity and diabetes, it's extremely difficult to get back to normal.
It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not take in all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader issued a call to end violence in the refugee's home countries.
The Dalai Lama spoke about the current refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethical studies, at the start of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He stated that in the present situation, the interests of humanity should prevail over the interests of each nation and even each continent.
He also stressed that, while admirable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is inadequate to the situation.
'It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe,' he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to care for a few thousand refugees, but we must also think about long-term solutions to bring peace and genuine development, especially through education, to Muslim countries", he stressed.
Basically, we need to think about ways to reduce crime in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
Force has never solved these problems, he added.
On the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, saying that the violent response by the US had generated a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I sent a letter of condolence to President Bush and told him to resolve this issue without resorting to violence.
I know his motives were strong but he used force and generated unexpected consequences, the Dalai Lama said.
Quadrupling of children who ingested hand detergent in the last 4 years
According to the Georgia Poison Control Center, U.S. poison control centers have reported an increase of about 400% since 2010 in the number of children under 12 years of age who swallowed hand detergent with a high alcohol content.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Control Center, cases of children under 12 years of age ingesting hand detergent reported to poison control centers have risen from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children have more frequent access to these products and unfortunately, a percentage of them end up in the emergency room", Lopez told CNN.
Lopez said that some kids drink detergent intentionally and others do it to impress their friends or to respond to social media challenges.
You can watch videos on YouTube showing teenagers drinking detergent to create cheap beverages.
It turns out that teenagers mixed mouthwash with alcohol to get a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the attractive smell of detergent.
"A child doesn't think it's hurting him", says Lopez.
Many of the most attractive types are perfumed.
Strawberry, grape, orange flavored hand detergents are the most appealing to children.
Hand detergent contains about 45-95% alcohol.
Especially in young children, just a few sips can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's very concentrated", said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the anti-poisoning center at the University of Kansas Hospital, to Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these hand detergents in accessible places and if the little ones get to them, that's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested the equivalent of four strawberry-flavored hand-wash sprays at school, arrived at the emergency room to receive treatment.
She had an alcohol level of 179, twice the legal limit for an adult under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, the emergency room doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was stuttering and couldn't walk when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children's hospital to identify signs of brain damage, as the girl fell and hit her head from alcohol, Ritchey said.
"It was scary", Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or wet wipes and to keep hand detergent out of children's reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some detergents have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand detergent containing an undeclared toxic ingredient.
The health authorities assumed that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which was specified as the active ingredient.
In January, three fourth graders in upstate New York plotted to poison their teacher by putting antibacterial products in the classroom, according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand detergent and has banned it in her classroom.
The police considered the plan to be "insignificant" and referred the disciplinary matter to the school inspectorate.

The absence of the Scots in the title race is boring the Dutch - by Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch international Ronald de Boer has stated that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because they are not fighting for the title with Rangers.
De Boer, currently Ajax ambassador, said: "I no longer broadcast Celtic's match summaries in the Netherlands; why?
Because the Rangers aren't there.
Here, we're not just talking about the return of the Rangers.
Talk about the Old Firm.
You talk about both teams together and that's where the interest goes.
The tension is high at the Old Firm games and it's not just the Scots who want to see these games.
I will change the situation, Deila promise.
Ronnie Deila has accepted that Celtic are struggling but the Norwegian boss has promised to change the situation.
The defeat to Malmo and the subsequent elimination from the Champions League was followed by a defeat to Aberdeen who played in the 10-man, now top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila said: "Celtic have had periods before and they will come back".
We want to get out of this situation as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are extremely angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel the same way - but we have to move on.
We need Celtic's support because that's how the players get better.
It's extremely important that we stay united now.
Warburton's caution about the January transfers
Despite comments just weeks ago suggesting he had identified some targets for January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious when it comes to transfers, insisting he does not want to affect the unity of the Ibrox team.
The former Brentford boss said: The January transfer period is very different from the summer.
For players who are transferred in the summer, there is a pre-season period where they can be integrated, which you could observe this season in our group.
The team is doing very well.
Sometimes you do more harm by bringing in unnecessary players.
Celtic are aiming for Michu after the withdrawal
Swansea striker Michu, associated with Celtic during the transfer window, has suggested he could retire at the end of his contract with the Swans.
The 29-year-old struggled with ankle problems for two years and was unable to leave Wales this summer.
Hearts is facing the SFA over Neilson's comments.
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent off and lost 3-2, but the fullback's red card was then revoked - the third red card revoked in eight months.
Neilson maintains his statements, insisting: "I did not question integrity, I did not comment on performance".
The Griffiths swear to avoid Tynecastle
The invincible Hibee was taken down after he admitted to singing a song with offensive lyrics about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in March 2014 at a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before a derby with Edinburgh at Tynecastle.
"It was the derby and it was the excitement of the moment", said the striker, adding: "Needless to say I won't return to Tynecastle unless I play for Celtic".
The Tannadice Council has confidence in the management of Dundee United.
Simon Donnelly insists that those on the Dundee United board still have confidence that the management team will change the situation - but he agrees that the decline on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We're gonna get the boys back in shape, Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy for the dirty win against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that Aberdeen have to cling desperately to Hamilton Accies for their seventh consecutive league win, which brought them five points ahead of Celtic thanks to a first-half penalty from Adam Rooney.
McInnes said, "There's no team that's won anything, in the cup or the league, that hasn't won games like that".
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while in the UK it is rising
THE unemployment rate in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 in May and July, while the number of unemployed in the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
The unemployment rate of 5.9% in Scotland was higher than the UK's 5.5%, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, the employment rate in Scotland fell by 12,000 over the three-month period, to 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell in that quarter to 74.0% - above the UK average of 73.5.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: 'The authorities' long-term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy'.
It's been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In the last 12 months, we have seen improvements in the labour market in Scotland, with the employment rate rising and the unemployment rate falling.
Why am I witnessing an execution in Oklahoma
During the course of today, except for a late legal intervention, I will watch as a man is sentenced to death.
If it does, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting in an observation room in the execution room of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary and watch Richard Glossip be executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation first came in January through his best friend, and though I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day of the cause approaches, I'm terrified of the idea.
So why would I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of capital punishment.
It would give you a unique perspective.
It's true, journalists can witness executions in America, and because the demands usually outnumber the seats available, a macabre lottery is held to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for press representatives from 12 to five.
The elected officials will watch the execution impartially.
I can't do that.
I would sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, plus I developed my own connection with him over months of phone conversations and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
Prison officials say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to carry a notebook and a pen to write down what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A reporter in Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he wants it, get access.
I complained to her.
He admitted that he could have spoken better, but he still thinks they are wrong.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote.
Don't tell me what to write and I wouldn't do it even if they asked me.
I told him he could take me off the witness list anytime.
But he wants an international report to be on the subject.
He thinks if he dies, the publicity will help the anti-death penalty movement.
Kim Bellware, reporter at the Huffington Post, will be joining me.
If you want to learn more about the case, listen to the series of multimedia files that we made.
I'm not going to go into all the details here.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese make him guilty of complicity.
But I think it's highly likely he's not guilty of murder.
I believe for certain there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I'll watch him die from that perspective.
I can't pretend to be totally objective.
For that, you can read articles written by other reporters.
From me you will learn what it is to watch a man I love die needlessly.
Peter Moody claims the stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to withdraw from the races
Peter Moody claimed that his Victoria Racing stewards tried to infiltrate a spy at his stables last year and threatened to withdraw immediately from racing.
He launched an attack on the stewards and integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming that they were running a personal campaign against him, the straw that broke the camel's back being Lady Tatai's disqualification from the race due to a treatment given on race day.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what's best for the racing industry and that he is put in a difficult position when it comes to Lidari's positive test for cobalt, for which he has no explanation.
For 18 months, she swallowed her words about the statements about the spies and didn't want to be like the fox that doesn't reach the grapes.
"I wasn't going to say anything about it and I kept quiet for a long time but sometimes you get to a level of frustration so high that everything just flashes", Moody said.
It's known to have continued.
Sometimes you react and you have to suffer the consequences, and I'm going to have to live with what I said.
Tonight I'll go home and sleep peacefully.
I want to go head-to-head and I want the owners I work with to see that I try to give them the best.
The moment they start to think that's not happening, I have to quit coaching.
At that point, I'm gonna have to figure out what to do with my certification.
Earlier, Moody dropped the bombshell in an interview with racing.com in which he claimed the integrity department tried to spy on his stables.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - whose name I'll give if asked - and they offered to hire him to my stables to provide information about the activity there", Moody told Racing.com.
Obviously he thinks I'm a cheat.
If that's the case, then they should all resign because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former RVL president, David Moodie, current RVL president and Bernard Saundry, current RVL CEO, knew it at the time and they know it today.
Am I supposed to think it's personal?
Does it need to be that RVL starts to have a backbone and can hold people outside of the trainers accountable for what's going on in the industry?
Am I a bad influence on the industry?
Is my influence on the industry that bad?
Maybe that's how others see it.
Maybe they need to take my license and put me away, and I have no doubt that the statements I'm making now might cause them to consider that option.
But I've reached the point where I don't care anymore, and that makes me sad.
It makes me very sad.
I'll put pressure on and I'll get them to make a decision.
My family is behind me and I can leave.
The trainer's frustration increased with the lengthy investigation into the cobalt testing involving Lidari and the elimination prompted him to say he could 'put his license on the table'.
Moody, whose name is most often associated with the training of undefeated champion Black Caviar, labeled the race day treatment rule as "ridiculous" after applying mud or clay cataplasm to the horses' legs, which violates the rules.
It's against the rules of the race.
I have to take full responsibility for this, he says.
One of my employees accidentally put mud on his leg.
It could have happened last night.
It could have happened yesterday, which it did.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody could be disqualified for three months for the race-day treatment of cataplasm, which the flight attendants have opened an investigation into.
It's a joke, you know.
The people who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that rules are needed but it's gone too far", Moody said.
The driver who hit and fled the scene of the Cobram crash has been arrested
Police arrested a man after a collision with a cyclist occurred in Cobram over the weekend and followed by a run-off from the scene.
The cyclist was transported by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, being seriously injured after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Murray Valley Highway.
Police officials say the driver of the vehicle did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
Monday, a man in his 50s turned himself in to Shepparton police.
It looks like he's gonna be charged with hit-and-run, non-delivery of first aid, and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains hospitalized in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy is responding to the wrestling accusations.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy called criticism of his team's placing tactics "distorted subjects" brought up by the top two favourites in the NRL.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the umpires allowed the Storm players to take the field in the nervously won game by the Storm in the final qualifying game played Friday night in Sydney.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a light reference to the Storm after his team's qualifying victory over the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, calling the match a "demonstration" of rugby league and saying the two Queensland teams were not very good at wrestling.
Bellamy jumped in to defend his team's scoring tactics and stated that the players simply focused on "contact" when scoring.
Bellamy says he gained confidence after two top coaches criticized his team, which means they were worried that the Storm would beat them.
And things don't stop there - we didn't hear Trent Robinson complain about wrestling when they beat us 24-2, Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything all year in our defensive systems or techniques, except that in the last six weeks we've really focused on contact in pleasures and so we've changed the situation.
Trent's been in this position for three years and obviously has a great team so he's probably not used to losing and it was a shock for him.
Funny how it always happens this time of year.
Bellamy countered Bennett's idea of "encouraging football", reminding his mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010 by playing "complicitous football".
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He argued his point by comparing his game on Saturday night to our game on Friday night and talked about how exciting the game was, Bellamy said.
I remember back in 2010, St George's got a lot of criticism for being a boring team and Wayne said he didn't care about the black under the nail.
But now he has a team that can play what I would consider exciting football, especially thanks to the fast young midfielders.
That's the kind of game you want to play when you have players like that.
He brought that argument in 2010, now he wants everyone to adopt his style of play -- not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to be able to play that way.
It gives me more confidence because they're saying these things because they're kind of worried about the game against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us when they thought of the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the Storm-Roosters game was a more point-to-point contest compared to the Broncos-Cowboys game.
The Broncos game was probably a good game, I haven't seen it yet, what was the score?
Our game ended 20-18, our game had two more attempts, does that mean exciting game?
Or exciting is taking breaks and not marking?
They're plans to me.
If they're talking about us, it means we might meet them at some point.
Storm has this weekend off as they have earned the right to play either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks at home in the final of next Saturday's prelims at AAMI Park, with tickets going on sale starting next Tuesday morning.
Stevan Hogg used the girls' phones to lure pedophiles into sending pictures
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for pictures of abused children.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping and then logged into an online messaging service where another user sent him a series of indecent images of children.
The girl woke up later and noticed the phone was gone, which she found in Hogg's hand while he was sleeping.
She looked into her phone and found the disturbing messages and immediately alerted her mother.
Upon arrival, the police saw the five photos and then analyzed computers found at the address and found "worrying" Internet searches using terms to find indecent images of child subjects.
Hogg claimed he did it to lure pedophiles onto the Internet before pretending to be a cop to scare them off.
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee court: "He said it was an addiction - that it was addictive to scare people.
He admitted that he did the computer searches but said he did it because he wanted to impersonate a cop to scare off pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and about his asking that person to send him more pictures.
He said he did it to seduce.
He said he can't think clearly when he drinks and he wants to see images of rape and murder.
Mr Robertson added: "When the girl found the messages on her phone, she called out to her mother and she was shaking and crying.
The girl saw the indecent images on the phone and the defendant was confronted.
The girl was interviewed and told that the defendant used the computer and the Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Last June 14, Hogg, 23, of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to charges of taking or taking indecent photographs of child subjects, and violated his parole terms on January 25 this year and failed to appear in court on March 24 this year.
Defence counsel Gregor Sim has requested that Hogg not be registered as a sex offender because it can be argued that this offence "did not involve a significant sexual aspect".
Judge Alistair Carmichael has postponed the sentencing until October, citing social reporting.
Hogg was released on bail in this case but remained in custody before appearances for other cases.
He was put on the sex offender registry before he was sentenced.
Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, delivered the wrong speech in Parliament
Earlier this year, Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down the steps of a podium.
He was not hurt but the video of the fall went viral on social media.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also disrupted by opposition representatives who claimed that they had received anonymous death threats, threatening him not to yell at Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, he was booed during his speech in Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The leader of the parliamentary group Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones, warning them not to disrupt Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message was sent from a hidden number but it is titled 'death,'" he told reporters after Mr Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members concerned that immunity applies only in Parliament and once they leave Parliament, parliamentary immunity is no longer valid.
The head of the parliamentary group said that the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is "concerned" about the threats made to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard is going to make 30,000 layoffs.
Hewlett-Packard is expected to make between 25,000 and 30,000 layoffs as part of the company's efforts to restructure and reduce costs in the services sector.
This year, HP will split into two publicly traded companies, separating its computer and printer business from its rapidly growing enterprise hardware and services operations.
The expected releases will cost about $2.7 billion beginning in the fourth quarter, HP said.
"These restructurings will bring the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise a more competitive and cost-sustainable structure", said Meg Whitman, HP's president and CEO, who will lead the unit after the breakup.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more concentrated than HP currently is and will have a broad portfolio of businesses that will help companies transition to the new way of doing business, Whitman said.
Operating as a separate company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the growing demands of our global customers.
According to a company statement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of over $50 billion and will focus on providing unrivalled integrated solutions to enterprises.
It splits a company founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, whose business was the manufacture of electrical equipment and whose Palo Alto garage has been called the "Silicon Valley Legends".
HP has gone through a massive reorganization to adapt to the shift from traditional computers to mobile devices.
The move by HP, the world's second-largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, is the latest in the field, based on the idea that firms that focus their attention better in one direction perform better.
FriendsFest: the comedy series that taught us important lessons about male friendship
The absence of similar characters in the series is obvious, given that the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever, with suicide rates among young men reaching their highest in 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death among men aged 20-45 in the UK, and remains three times more common in men than women.
In an attempt to address the issue, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) has designated 2015 as the Year of the Man, seeking to challenge the culture that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the fight to succeed in this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students who had symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough friends  with a healthy mood, his chances of recovery double.
Similarly, for people who are not depressed, having a healthy circle of friends halves the likelihood of developing mental disorders.
Of course, for friendship to work, it must first be accessible.
In this age of social media-dominated communication, where the emphasis is on style rather than substance, the immediacy of the response often takes precedence over meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong, fun-loving, successful personality, even though in reality isolation is the dominant one.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values -- money, image, social status -- all at the expense of intrinsic values -- our inner desire for personal growth and friendship -- that affect our mental health even more profoundly.
The billionaire video game inventor recently explained that money really doesn't buy happiness.
The beauty of Friends was that it drew attention to this idea.
The characters were not defined by their work, but by their personality, which they showed through their interaction as friends.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, the moments of watching football in comfortable chairs, and Ross' passion for Rachel came from the fact that men are known to associate with this situation, even though they often shy away from fully exploring their feelings.
As one social worker explained to me, my role in listening to suicidal and depressed people showed how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference.
Often, people who turn to us feel unable to talk to their friends.
The old saying of doing it yourself is powerful, as is the feeling of being perceived as weak if you talk openly about problems.
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to provide more mechanisms for long-term psychological adaptation.
The show highlighted the little moments of friendship between men.
As much as objective, outside intervention, through the phone, helps people in desperate times, the long-term support comes from family and close friends.
So if you're at this weekend's FriendsFest by Comedy Central, with a full set of tapes to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends over for coffee in Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone alone at Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship might make.
Friends is aired by Comedy Central from start to finish - all 236 episodes - on #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores and helps PSG to take Malmo away
Angel Di Maria celebrates alongside Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored on Tuesday in his Champions League debut and helped PSG to win against Swedish side Malmo.
Here's the match and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani have done their duty, Paris Saint-Germain starting the Champions League group stage with a reassuring 2-0 win against Malmo in Tuesday's game at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored in less than four minutes of his Champions League debut for PSG, giving the French champions the lead although they missed a number of opportunities before securing the lead with Cavani's goal in the 61st minute.
Reaching Group A alongside Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions as the French team's objective is not only to qualify in the top but also to improve on their run to the quarter-finals in each of the last three tournaments.
But although they took the points, Laurent Blanc's pupils were far from a perfect picture, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic squandering the opportunity to score and being replaced by his hometown team and the club where he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so a 2-0 win creates problems for our opponents and sets a comfortable difference to the next-ranked, even if there are still aspects that we need to improve throughout the season", Blanc said.
It's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we did, although I'm sorry we couldn't score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic recovered from injury in one of three changes to the Paris team, with a 2-2 draw at home to Bordeaux in Ligue 1 over the weekend, but Di Maria took the spotlight in the fourth minute.
Last month when he was transferred from Manchester United, the Argentine attacking midfielder was named the man who will take PSG to the next level in Europe and he showed it when he snapped Marco Verratti's pass behind Malmo's defence before striking incredibly hard at Johan Wiland in the long corner of the right goal.
But if anyone expected PSG to win by flickering their fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who beat Celtic in the play-offs to reach this stage and entered the field with nine national team titles, with a five-man defence and two defensive midfielders, was a strong opponent.
But their attack was not impressive, except for Nikola Djurdjic's shot that passed Kevin Trapp's post in the 34th minute.
Instead, PSG players slowed down several times, giving a few unnecessary passes and unfinishing interventions, even Ibrahimovic who missed no less than five attempts in the first half alone and was then replaced by Cavani just after the resumption of the game.
Ibrahimovic proved much more adept at supporting his teammates, however, with his pass being the one Di Maria sent in a Wiland-deviated kick over the goal in the 52nd minute.
The second goal was scored in a final after an hour of play, thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan who scored his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic passed from Maxwell's centre.
This goal eliminated Malmo's hope of rebalancing the score and only a superb stop by Wiland from the distance for the repulse David Luiz kept the final score before newcomer Ezequiel Lavezzi was dismissed for a goal in overtime.
The Norwegian coach of the Malmo team, Age Hareide, later stated that PSG were a class over and that The last match we played in the Champions League was in December last year.
Since then, I've only played in the league in Sweden, which doesn't rise to the same level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Hats off to PSG.
They made a great game.
Glencore raises $2.5 billion in stock sales
Swiss mining giant Glencore, hit by falling stock prices on the commodities market, has raised $2.5 billion in stock sales as part of a massive debt relief plan.
Glencore, a London-listed company, said it had sold £1.6 billion of new shares to pay off the debt.
After losing 57% of its market share this year, the company is grappling with falling commodity prices, as China's declining economic activity is affecting demand and causing disaster in markets.
The preferential subscription right increased the price of Glencore's shares on the London Stock Exchange in Wednesday morning trading.
Shares rose by 2.77% to 131.60 shillings in the FTSE 100 index, which opened at a 0.69% higher value.
Glencore disclosed the sale of $2.5 billion of shares as part of larger plans to cover nearly one third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares at 125 shillings per share, down 2.4% from Tuesday's closing price.
He took out 1.3 billion shares of the company, representing 9.99% of the group.
The Commission also found that the Chinese imports from the PRC were not in line with the Union interest.
Xi insists on broader expansion of the global economy
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a reform group that the economy must open up more to the outside world to fuel growth.
"China must commit to attracting foreign investment and expertise and improve opening-up policies", Xi said at the 16th Central Leading Group Meeting for Deepening Overall Reform.
Promoting openness and encouraging reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and will give way to economic growth, Xi said.
The steering group adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative list on regulating market access, relaxing customs control policies, encouraging SOEs to absorb private capital and reorganising the resident registration system.
According to the declaration, a negative list will be drawn up identifying the sectors and areas of activity in which investments are not allowed.
The system will be tested and improved through test programmes.
According to the declaration, the measure is important because it will give the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, ensuring a law-based business environment and providing a wider opening of the market.
The State authorities will also weaken the controls over the powers they delegate to companies, ensuring that these companies decide how to conduct their business.
The Chinese authorities also claimed that the Chinese authorities have not been able to provide the information requested by the Chinese authorities.
In an attempt to open up the state-controlled sectors, several sectors will be opened up to private investment.
The State authorities will not change their policy on foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of companies set up with foreign investment and provide them with better services, according to the declaration.
In addition, it will be easier for foreign nationals to apply for permanent residence permits or so-called 'green cards', streamlining the requirements and streamlining the application process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of the right to practise as a lawyer and the education of judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement made after the meeting.
Education unions, unhappy with the government's proposal to raise wages by 10%
Negotiations between Prime Minister Victor Ponta and the leaders of the Education unions failed to produce any results, with the Government proposing a 10% salary increase from 1 December, with payment on 1 January 2016, and the unions wanting a 15% increase from November, or a 20% increase from December.
The talks took place at the Victoria Palace on Tuesday evening, with the Prime Minister accompanied by Education Minister Sorin Cimpeanu, Finance Minister Eugen Teodorovici and Labour Minister Rovana Plumb.
We are not satisfied with the Government's proposal today, otherwise we would not have been in a position to convene the leaders of our federations.
The 10 percent that was promised to us today is less than we expected.
"In fact, this 10 percent is the money we agreed on in our agreement with the government last year for 2016", Anton Hadar, president of Alma Mater, said at the end of the talks.
Bottom line: In the future, health and education will be the areas where we're going to invest all the money we have.
According to him, a meeting of the FSLI will be held on Thursday, at which government representatives will also attend to present the proposal for wage increases to the representatives of the country's confederations, and the trade unionists will decide whether to accept the offer of the Executive.
The Prime Minister also told the trade unionists that the government is trying to send the Wage Act to Parliament as soon as possible so that it can come into force on 1 December.
The normative act provides for a 25% increase in salaries in the education system, out of the total increase of 70%, which the document provides for to be scaled up over the next four years.
Victor Ponta also promised the trade unionists to acquit all the judges in 2016.
The migrant crisis: tragedy in the Aegean
At least 22 migrants drowned in Turkish territorial waters on Tuesday after their boat capsized.
Among the victims were 11 women and 5 children, reports AFP, according to Yahoo News.
The boat was in the Aegean Sea and headed for the Greek island of Kos.
The Turkish coast guard said it had rescued 249 people from the shipwrecked boat, but their nationalities are still unknown.
Earlier Monday, two more people died while trying to cross the Aegean Sea.
Also over the weekend, 34 migrants, including 4 babies and 11 children, drowned off the Greek island of Farmakonisi, located 15 kilometers off the Turkish coast.
The situation was similar: the boat was carrying more people than it could carry, so it sank.
The route has become popular recently for immigrants who want to escape war and hard life in countries like Syria or Iraq.
Over 100 flight attendants fired for being too fat
Air India is laying off about 130 flight attendants for being overweight, the airline announced late last week.
The state-owned company said the decision was made for security reasons and recent government regulations, but critics say the move is "ridiculous" and "shockingly sexist", The Washington Post reports.
The mass layoffs are the latest in a decade-long battle between the company and the more fat stewardesses.
The weight limit for these dates back to the 1980s, when Air India started using charts with ideal weight and height.
In 2006, Air India fired nine flight attendants who were considered 'exceptionally overweight' as this 'may have an effect on reflexes and may impede the agility needed to carry out emergency measures'.
The stewardesses sued the company, won, and were rehired, but the company fired them again in 2009.
"All efforts to get them to lose weight have failed", a company spokesman explained.
A star soccer player teaches Gigi Becali what decision he made
A football player from the Star is giving Gigi Becali a lesson in how to promote young players.
If the champion's financier decided to close the football academy in which he had invested a considerable sum, quarterback Paul Papp opened a football school.
The Paul Papp Academy will be running in Dej, with the local kids being expected for a first selection action.
I am extremely happy that I have reached this stage, to give the start of the Football Academy that bears my name.
It's extremely important to me that we find talented kids who can play football without having to worry about money at practice.
They have only one concern: to play football as well as they can.
The technical details don't have to be their concern.
They need to value their talent.
This is what Paul Papp Football Academy wants to do.
"I'm also waiting for Mayor Costan Morar at the first selection of the children, to show them that he is with them", football player Papp told dejeanul.ro.

The party wants to govern.
PSD interim president Liviu Dragnea said on Tuesday that the party wants to remain in government, and if the prime minister wants, the PSD congress will formalize this decision.
I understand that Mr. Ponta is waiting for this decision from the PSD Congress, everyone wants to govern, the whole party.
If they want to formalize it through an act of Congress, we will do that.
There's not gonna be any excitement about it.
"There have been no elements, voices in the party, opinions in the party that give someone uncertainty about the government or that give someone the impression that someone in the party does not want the PSD to remain in the government, in the current government, with the current prime minister", Dragnea said at the end of the session of the PSD's Permanent National Bureau.
PSD has announced when it will hold a congress - what will be decided then
Prime Minister Victor Ponta said on Tuesday that it is important that at the PSD Congress, beyond the choice of leadership, a clear message is given if the party wants to continue to govern or if it decides to go into opposition.
I'll announce Monday if I'm running for Congress.
On the other hand, Liviu Dragnea will announce next Monday if he will run for a leadership position at the next Congress.
I'll sing on Monday after the Executive Committee, if the date of the convention is set.
"I will announce if I will run for a position in the party leadership", Dragnea said at the end of Tuesday's session of the PSD's National Permanent Bureau.
Asked if the hesitation in announcing the candidacy was related to his file, Dragnea said he did not have this problem.
I don't have the issue you're referring to, but it seems fair and honest to all my colleagues in the party to announce whether or not I'm a candidate at the time that the date is formally established by Congress.
"It's the only motivation", said Dragnea.
The vast majority of the Social Democratic affiliates have proposed an extraordinary PSD Congress on October 11, and the exact date of the Congress will be decided on Monday by the party's Executive Committee.

An Italian was caught at the Bors customs with immigrants hiding in TIR
Two Sri Lankan nationals were spotted Monday at Bors customs while trying to cross the border illegally, hiding in the trunk of a semi-truck driven by an Italian national.
Investigations revealed that the two were paying the driver 4,000 euros to be transported to France, the Border Police said.
At the specific check, border guards noticed a large travel bag in the cabin of the truck, containing personal belongings for several people, which is why they carried out a thorough check on the means of transport.
On that occasion, border guards discovered two men hiding in the trunk of the car, among the plastic boxes.
The verification results showed that the persons concerned, two men, aged 28, are Sri Lankan nationals and asylum seekers in Romania.
"In their investigations, the young people stated that they intended to reach France, and they contacted a conationalist, through whom they met the Italian driver, who offered to transport them to their destination, where they would receive 2,000 euros per person", the Border Police statement said.
The two migrants were given "criminal proceedings for the offence of attempting to cross the state border fraudulently".
Also, Pompeo B., a 45-year-old Italian national who was driving a Romanian-registered Renault Magnum truck carrying plastic boxes for an Italian company, was detained for 24 hours and was to be presented to the Bihor Court with a motion for pre-trial arrest.
How satisfied are Romanians in marriage: Men versus women
Most Romans are content with their relationships.
This is the conclusion of a study carried out on the occasion of the visit to Romania of John Gray, the famous author of the bestseller "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus".
A total of 62% of respondents said they were 'very satisfied' and 'satisfied' with the overall quality of their relationship.
"Yet 18% report being 'slightly dissatisfied' and 'very dissatisfied' in their relationship, and another 18% report being 'appropriate'", the study concluded, as reported in a press release on Tuesday by Ziare.com.
The situation is slightly different when we look at the men's and women's responses separately.
So 28% of men are very satisfied, 39% satisfied, 17% satisfied, 6% very dissatisfied and 8% slightly dissatisfied.
For women, 33% were satisfied, 24% very satisfied, 8% very dissatisfied, 14% slightly dissatisfied and 19% chose the appropriate category.
When we look at the satisfaction level, we see that men are more satisfied.
As for the neutral state, we see a difference of two percent.
"Similarly, in the very unsatisfied situation, the biggest difference is recorded at the slightly unsatisfied response where we see a difference of 6 percent", the release continues.
The study also showed that a quarter of Romanians (26%) spend an hour or less together, 18% spend between five and eight hours together, and 45% spend between two and four hours together.
The authors of the study also report that "Romanians feel the need for a little more adventure in their lives (24%), followed by affection (21%), money (21%), security (20%), new (19%), sex (19%), respect 18%, trust 17%, pleasure 17%, connection 17%, knowledge 16%, protection 14%, importance 14%, learning 12%, freedom 11%, self-knowledge 10% and control 7%".
The study was conducted by Extreme Training from 1 June to 1 September on 1,369 people, with a calculated margin of error of 2.6%.
Europe has once again been shamed
German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said on Tuesday that Europe was "ashamed" after Monday's failure of the Brussels ministerial meeting on the distribution of refugees within the European Union.
"Tonight (Monday night), Europe has once again been shamed", said Sigmar Gabriel, who is also the economy minister in Chancellor Angela Merkel's government, at a press conference.
Earlier, German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere suggested cutting EU structural funds for countries that reject refugee quotas.
European interior ministers, meeting in Brussels on an emergency basis on Monday, have failed to agree on the mandatory distribution of 120,000 refugees requested last week by the European Commission to deal with one of Europe's worst migration crises since 1945.
He was mayor for only half an hour
The acting mayor of Tuzla in Constanta County has only enjoyed half an hour of this office because of the DNA prosecutors.
Taner Resit was appointed to lead the village, replacing the former mayor, Constantin Micu, convicted of embezzlement, B1 Tv reports.
The county prefect, Ion Constantin, was waiting for him at the headquarters of the institution to make the official announcement at 4:00 p.m., but he never arrived.

According to prosecutors, he is accused of blackmailing a businessman between August 16 and September 8, in complicity with Stefan Radu, a boss who wanted to get 48,000 euros from him, shows Pravda.
The two threatened the manager, kicked out his customers, blocked them from his store, changed the locks, and seized the company's assets.
Moreover, on September 8th, Stefan Radu would have beaten the administrator in the presence of the deputy mayor.
Thousands of people came to put a candle on it
Thousands of people passed by the coffin with the lifeless body of Cornelius Vadim Tudor, so many people did not come to the Church of St. George but to the consecration of his house at the Great Temple of St. Nicholas, said on Wednesday, parish priest Emil Caramizaru.
Hundreds of people of all ages wait in line, stretching from the church entrance to the side streets, to pass by the catacombs on which the coffin with the lifeless body of Cornelius Vadim Tudor is located.
People wait about an hour to reach the Church of St. George the New, where groups of up to 40 people enter.
About 300 people an hour passed by the coffin of Cornelius Vadim Tudor.
Thousands of people from Bucharest, but also from Cluj, Baia Mare, Iasi, Constanta and Craiova came, starting on Tuesday, to pay homage to Corneliu Vadim Tudor, so many people we had only at the 300th anniversary of the church and the Great Temple of St. Nicholas.
"Corneliu Vadim Tudor was at the 300th anniversary consecration of the church and sat next to the members of the Holy Synod, the Blessed Daniel and representatives of the five patriarchs who participated in the consecration", said the parish priest of the church in the capital, Emil Caramizaru.
According to him, people came with flowers and candles in hand, sitting neatly and waiting in line, as on a day of great religious celebration.
It's amazing how these people behave, they're all sitting there, with dignity, children, old people, people in their carriages, like they're at a big religious celebration.
"It is moving to see them waiting to bow and pay their last respects to Vadim Tudor", said Parish Priest Emil Caramizaru.
According to him, at the request of the family of Cornelius Vadim Tudor, the church will remain open on Wednesday and Thursday nights, last night being closed at 01:00 and reopened in the morning at 07:00.
He said that on Thursday morning at 10.00 a.m. in the Church of St. George, at kilometer 0, a short service will be held, after which the coffin with the body of Vadim Tudor will be transported to the civil cemetery of Ghencea, where the funeral service will take place, with a religious and military ceremony being officiated.
The priest insisted that Vadim Tudor would often come to this church, especially in the evening, after 8pm, and then he would ask him to open the fridge with the remains of St. Nicholas and stay for minutes to pray in the siren.
He used to come here very often, usually after 8pm, begging me to open his fridge with the relics of St. Nicholas and pray.
He said it's a great blessing this church of Brancoveanu.
He said to me, "Brother Emil, think that here were Brancoveanu, Eminescu, Michael the Hero, who held hands with St. Nicholas".
"'You can see what a blessing this country is,' Vadim would tell me", the parish priest related.
Cornelius Vadim Tudor is to be buried Thursday at the Ghencea Civil Cemetery with full military honors.
The Senate leadership on Tuesday rejected the request of the wife of Cornelius Vadim Tudor that the coffin containing the former senator's lifeless body be deposited in the hall of the Legislative Chamber.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor was born on 28 November 1949 in Bucharest, he was a writer, politician and journalist.
He was the founder of the Romania Mare Party, a former member of the European Parliament and a former senator.
What's going on with Coach Darren Cahill?
Simona Halep is facing a crucial decision for her career, having to choose whether or not to continue working with coach Darren Cahill.
The two worked this year under the Adidas Player Development program, with the Australian technician only joining the novelist at major tournaments.
Simona had nothing but praise for Cahill, who seems to be the only coach who has managed to impose himself on the capricious athlete.
Adidas's contract expires at the end of this year, and Halep must decide whether to offer Cahill a consistent contract or to withdraw.
We don't know exactly what's going to happen yet.
We'll talk and see.
"After Singapore I will be able to give an answer", Simona confessed at a press conference.
Darren Cahill is one of the most expensive coaches in tennis today, he's requesting a contract of about a million dollars a year.
The Australian is also a sports commentator, a job he would not want to give up at the moment.
The last match Simona and Cahill will be working together is the Champions Tour, in Singapore.
It wasn't normal, I wasn't respected
Victor Piturca revealed how he parted ways with the Romanian national team last fall.
The former coach confessed that he did not get along with the FRF president, Razvan Burleanu, after he took the place of Mircea Sandu, and thus made the decision to leave the national team.
Finally, he offered the head of the Federation a substantial increase in his salary to stay, but he was refused.
Right now I'm not sorry I left the Nationals.
I was sorry, I was leaving a job behind.
So I thought it was good for me then and I think it was good for me.
What happened to me when I was a trainer, it wasn't normal, I wasn't respected, my work wasn't respected.
I worked well with the Federation's predecessors, but when Burleanu came to the Federation he came up with a preconceived notion, he didn't know me, he got different opinions from the press about me.
It didn't change me because it was very difficult at the time, with the results that I had, plus the financial situation in the middle.
I kept working, everything went very well, and he probably changed his mind too.
But I wanted to leave.
If they wanted me to stay, I offered them an extension.
We have about 400 and something of thousands of euros a year, I was going to have about 600 thousand euros.
I didn't talk to Burleanu, I talked to his right hand.
"He agreed, but only if we finished first in the group", Victor Piturca told Dolce Sport.
Victor Piturca resigned from the Romanian national team last autumn, although the team had good results in the Euro 2016 preliminaries.
The technician accepted the offer to train in Saudi Arabia, he immediately took over the Al Ittihad group.
Armor and water cannons at the border
Hungarian police have detached Humvee military vehicles equipped with machine guns at the border with Serbia after violent clashes on Wednesday, when water cannons and tear gas were used against migrants trying to break in from Serbia, despite Hungary having erected a barbed wire fence.
At least 20 police officers and two children were injured in the clashes, Russia Today reports.
So far 20 police officers have been injured and the ambulance service has picked up two children who were injured after being thrown over the security fence.
"We will rebuild the fence and we will strengthen it and we will protect the security of Hungary by any means", said Gyorgy Bakondi, the security adviser to the Hungarian prime minister.
Police tried to control the crowd with water cannons and tear gas, throwing plastic bottles, stones and pieces of pavement.
Authorities reported that several dozen migrants broke through the fence at the crossing between the towns of Roszke and Horgos and managed to enter the country.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto has called on Serbia to take action against "very aggressive" migrants at the common border.
There are reports that the Serbs have also increased their police forces at the border.
In the wake of Wednesday's incidents, Budapest suspended the crossing of the Roszke-Horgos border for 30 days.
Hungary is in concerted action to close its borders to prevent immigrants from entering.
If on Tuesday he announced that next to the barbed wire fence on the border with Serbia he will raise one on the border with Romania, towards the vehement protests of Bucharest, on Wednesday, the Hungarian Prime Minister announced the erection of a fence on the border with Croatia.
The rare disease a man suffers from
American Nick Hess was suspected by his family of being an alcoholic, his wife even filming him when he was dizzy, he could barely stand up, and his words were hard to understand.
Although the 35-year-old man said he had not consumed alcohol, he was clearly intoxicated.
When she first accused me of being drunk, when I wasn't, I thought she was crazy.
"But friends and family thought 'maybe he drinks alone, he's an alcoholic in secret,'" he says, according to the Mirror.
When he saw the footage of his wife with him, the Columbus, Ohio, man simply didn't recognize himself: "I looked into my eyes and I wasn't there".
'It was awful, I couldn't remember anything.'
Plus, his wife, who, though she doubted him for a while, eventually went with him to countless doctors, remembers Nick's breath smelling like alcohol.
The moment that put Nick on his mind the most was when, after a minor accident, when he was hit by another car, it was discovered that he had three times the legal limit of alcohol, although the night before he had only had one beer.
After years and countless investigations, it was discovered that Nick suffered from an extremely rare disease, "Auto-brewery syndrome".
Basically, his body is making all the carbohydrates he consumes ferment into alcohol.
The one who suspected it might be Nick's disease was the wife herself.
The disease doesn't have a cure yet, but since he stopped carbs, Nick hasn't had any of these episodes.
He crashed a Mercedes with a golf club
A man in South Korea destroyed his car, a Mercedes S63, in protest at the services he received from his dealer.
The man attacked his car with a golf club, causing enough damage to have the car taken out of service, reports BT.
The whole scene was filmed, and the video was leaked onto the Internet, to the amusement of those who watched it.
The man claimed that the car had defects that threatened his life and that of his family.
His anger arose when the dealer from whom he purchased the car did not solve his problem as agreed.
The government approved on Wednesday the "National Immigration Strategy for 2015-2018" and the "Action Plan for the current year", documents considered to be "another stage that Romania is going through in the efforts to modernize the immigration management process on the national territory", according to a press release.
The source cited shows that the strategy aims at the efficient management of the phenomenon of immigration, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and directions of action reflecting the policies established at European level, adapted to national realities.
In view of the problems faced by the States in the immediate neighbourhood of Romania, measures are envisaged for the united and coherent management of situations arising from the possible emergence of an influx of illegal immigrants into Romania, caused by crisis situations of a political, social, economic or military nature.
'The Romanian authorities will contribute to the creation of a flexible admission system, but at the same time will pay particular attention to citizens from states with potential migration or who may pose a threat to national security,' the source adds.
The strategy identifies a number of factors that may influence immigration and asylum, including the continuation of the conflict situation in Syria, the resumption of the conflict in Iraq, the continuation of an unstable situation in the areas bordering Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), the perpetuation and intensification of the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict.
The document also sets out a number of general strategic objectives related to immigration, such as: promoting legal migration, more stringent checks on the legality of the stay of third-country nationals in Romania and the appropriate application of removal and restrictive measures, and improving the national asylum system.
The national strategy shall also include specific objectives relevant to the transposition and implementation of the general strategic objectives.
These include: facilitating access to the Romanian territory for third-country nationals who meet the needs of the labour force, facilitating access for third-country nationals to Romanian higher education institutions for areas and professions identified as deficient.
The Commission notes that the 2015 Action Plan is a 'means to establish concrete activities leading to the creation of a flexible system to stop the growing migration phenomenon'.
Romania, in a European top on the labour market
Latvia, Romania and Bulgaria recorded the highest growth in total labour costs among EU Member States in the second quarter of the year compared to the same period in 2014, according to data published by the European Statistical Office (Eurostat) on Wednesday.
The index refers to the personnel expenditure of employers.
Thus, between April and June 2015, total labour costs increased by 1,9% in the European Union and by 1,6% in the euro area.
Romania, third in the EU in labour cost growth
The largest increases were reported in Latvia (7,9%), Romania (7,7%), Bulgaria (6,8%), Estonia (5,5%) and Lithuania (4,3%).
The only EU countries where hourly labour costs fell in the second quarter of this year were Greece (minus 2.9%), Cyprus (minus 1.2%) and Italy (minus 0.4%).
The increase in labour costs in Romania in the period April-June 2015 is mainly due to the increase in hourly labour costs in industry and services by 7,9% and 7,6%, respectively.
In the construction sector, Romania recorded an advance of 5.8% in hourly labour costs.
TVR management activity report rejected in committees: Stelian Tanase risks being fired
The culture committees of the Parliament rejected on Wednesday the activity report of the Board of Directors of the Romanian Television Society for 2014.
The report was rejected by 17 MPs, one against the rejection (Senator Varujan Vosganian) and one abstained.
The text of the report shall be forwarded to the Permanent Offices meeting.
They'll decide, probably next week.
The next plenary will be debated.
"I think given this situation it will be done relatively quickly", said the chair of the Senate Culture Committee, Georgica Severin.
He added that it was 'common sense' for the TVR management to be present at this meeting, since no representative of the TVR management was present at the meeting of the Culture Committees.
It was good sense to have the TVR leadership present because no one here has been subjected to personal attacks or anything like that.
The invitation was made to the CA members last night, about an hour before we knew what time it was, but today, after the meeting of the convened Bureau, I personally sent a fax to the TVR leadership inviting her.
I think the moment you're summoned, you're being budgeted, paid from public taxes and you're summoned to a meeting of the assembled committees even if you don't like living.
"Because it's your duty, you're in an institution subordinate to Parliament", Severin said after the meeting of the Parliament's Culture Committees.
He added that the financial aspects of the institution were discussed at the meeting on the basis of the negative opinion of the Budget Committees.
We've seen the debts continue, and the idea was that this year would be up to date, but they didn't pay off the historical ones.
"I remind you that it is not my fault or anyone else's fault that the commissions lost that pleasant with the banks and the tax, they are clear management problems", Severin said.
He added that after the activity report is rejected by the plenary, elections will be held for a new Board of Directors, which will elect the Director-General of the institution.
I don't know who's going to be nominated for this job.
Miracles will not happen.
It's important to make political decisions for this institution to function.
I'm not the man to lie to you, to tell you that a genius will appear who will stand in line here and fight.
I hope that those who decide, the plenary of Parliament, by their vote will choose with much reason the people who will lead TVR.
There must be people who know what's going on there, have experience and have a lot of fairness and respect for institution and tradition.
I don't know who he's going to be, if you ask me what qualities he has to have -- good sense in his attitude toward employees because it's a mess of petitions coming from employees, complaints, layoffs.
"When you get these 50, 60, 70 reports, something is rotten and we're talking about the financial situation that's a disaster", the chairman of the Senate culture committee concluded.
Although he did not appear in Parliament, TVR's President-General Stelian Tanase sent a letter to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Valeriu Zgonea, asking the Parliament to consider a series of measures that could lead to the salvage and guarantee of the economic and political independence of public television, including the indexation of the TV tax.
In the letter, Stelian Tanase requested, in addition to the indexation of the TV fee, the amendment of HG 978/2003 on the public service television fee, in order to update the provisions on the level of technological changes on a daily basis, and to regulate the procedure for the control in the field of the payment of the TV fee and the detection of infringements and the application of penalties and penalties.
It also wants a provision to extend the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become agents of SRTv for the collection of the TV charge by involving ANRE in the regulation of this activity.
In its view, a maximum ceiling of 5% of the commission on receipts should be set.
Stelian Tanase is asking for the VAT rate for the specific activities of the public television station and the contribution for the CNC to be reduced from 15% to 3%, and also to amend Law 41/1994 to allow for the possibility of receiving budgetary/financial allocations for the purchase of licenses for major cultural and sporting events - the World Cup, the Golden Deer, Eurovision.
He argues that SRTv will become insolvent in the coming months given that labour law obliges the employer to enforce court decisions, even if they are not final, and that wage rights are honoured with priority over any other obligation.
The TVR administration has made constant efforts to reduce staff and TV production costs.
"Thus, travel and other cost-generating activities were reduced, a number of commercial contracts were renegotiated, and TVR News was closed at the end of July", the letter from TVR's president states.
Tanase believes that the financial disaster cannot be remedied by her own efforts.
'Without the support of the state institutions - the Government, Parliament, the Presidency - Romanian television will sooner or later be unable to fulfil its public mission,' the letter states.
The leadership of the Chamber of Deputies has decided to send the letter to the Committee on Culture.
Vasile Blaga's son-in-law, sent to court
Vasile Blaga's son-in-law, Ionut Andrei Rudeanu, was sent to trial on Wednesday by the prosecutors of the Prosecutor's Office near the Bucharest Court of Appeal.
He is accused of tax evasion, in a case involving damages of approximately 600,000 euros, and is under judicial control.
Andrei Rudeanu was arrested on 22 May.
He founded the security firm Axis Corporate Security SRL, alongside his mother, in April 2009, one year after marrying Vasile Blaga's daughter, Agathe.
The investigation revealed that, in order to evade the payment of taxes and duties to the State budget, representatives of a company specialising in security services had set up a criminal network, consisting of several commercial companies, which had revealed fictitious transactions.
"In fact, the company's accounts would have recorded fictitious purchases of services, which, in reality, were not provided, thus damaging the state budget by about 600,000 euros", the Romanian Police explained in a press release.
The Six have decided the fate of Sanmartean
The Sixers of the Al-Ittihad Club have decided the fate of the middle Lucian Sanmartean.
Although the Arab press reports that Sanmartean's separation from Ittihad is imminent, the manager of the contractor Ladislau Boloni, Arcadie Zaporojanu, says that this will not happen again.
Bologna is very pleased with the Sanmartean.
Lucian plays title match by match and does it well.
The Sixers also realized that he was the best and that it would be wrong to give him up.
There was a possibility of bringing in another player, a much better one, but nothing came of it.
"There were several discussions, like the one with Mbark Boussoufa, but nothing came to fruition", Zaporojanu told Digi Sport.
Lucian Sanmartean arrived at Al-Ittihad earlier this year.
Ilie Sarbu was voted Vice President of the Court of Auditors
The plenary of the Parliament voted on Wednesday to appoint PSD Senator Ilie Sarbu, father-in-law of Prime Minister Victor Ponta, as Vice-President of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors.
According to Mediafax, 290 votes were cast in favour and 108 against.
The vote was secret, with ballots.
The PNL representatives were the only ones who voted against this proposal, reports Digi24.
Moreover, the Liberals have criticized Sarbu's appointment to this post and announced that they will challenge it to the CCR, given that he has a DNA record but does not have the necessary training and experience.
Ilie Sarbu has 30 days, according to the law, to resign from the Senate, because the new position at the Court of Accounts does not allow him to do politics anymore.
The PSD senator will take the post of Vice-President of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors, left vacant after Ioan Anton was dismissed following a decision of the Constitutional Court in September 2014 that found his appointment unconstitutional.
Surprise from one of the hottest actors: I grew up in the kitchen.
As Bradley Cooper is about to play a chef in "Burnt", the actor has made a revelation his girlfriend never expected.
In a recent interview, he stated that he grew up mostly in the kitchen: "I worked most of my life as a cook".
He revealed that he had been working in the kitchen since he was 15 years old, when he was working for a Greek restaurant, and then, in college, he continued on the same path.
The actor explained that his mother is of Italian descent, so his entire childhood he cooked with his Italian grandmother, reports ContactMusic.
Asked what his plans were for the future at the time, Bradley Cooper said that he was never the kind of man to make plans for five years, "not even two".
"It's not motivating at all for me to have a map", he said.
"I have dreams, things you would laugh at if I told you", he said, but claiming that what he had wanted since childhood had come true.
At the age of 40, the actor admitted that he sees himself in the near future directing, taking the model of Clint Eastwood, who also took up directing at this age.
Ponta, accused of uncontrolled slander and irrational statements
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto strongly condemned on Wednesday morning the statements of Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta that Hungary's political decision-makers are "no better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees flee".
"Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost his temper and, with his irrational statements, is insulting the whole of Hungary", the Hungarian Foreign Minister said in a statement.
Civilized European politicians don't say such uncontrolled slanders.
"His remarks have only one explanation: he has completely lost support in Romania's domestic politics", the Hungarian foreign minister added, according to MTI.
In a Facebook post on Tuesday evening, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he wanted to draw attention to and sanction the behavior of some high-ranking Hungarian government officials, who he said "are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union".
I do not wish to respond to the challenges from some representatives of the Hungarian government.
"They are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union; and to anti-Semitic attitudes, and to the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now during the refugee crisis!" Ponta wrote on Facebook.
The Romanian Prime Minister added that he is in favour of rational and sustainable solutions to the refugee crisis, believing that brutality and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
The rigged wire, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, there are no better political decision-makers than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which the respective refugees are fleeing!
"I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions and above all in the superiority of European values - what we have seen in Hungary in recent days is in total contradiction with these very objectives and values!" the Romanian chief executive stressed.
Earlier on Tuesday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto called Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta's remarks about Hungary's handling of the refugee crisis "simple lies", saying such statements were inappropriate for a 21st-century leader, according to MTI.
The Hungarian foreign minister also mentioned on Tuesday that the Romanian prime minister's "extremist and lying remarks" were related to the internal political crisis in Romania and said that Budapest expects an apology from the Romanian side.
Szijjarto was referring to a statement made by Prime Minister Victor Ponta on Monday.
What I've said and I've always said is that I'm against xenophobic rhetoric, the idea of closing borders, that everyone who comes in is a terrorist, is a medieval fool, and I'm totally against that approach.
If we can get more, we will, the problem is our logistical ability to treat those people as human beings, not as they treat our neighbors, the Hungarians, with the bat and the sunset.
"I don't agree with that", the Romanian chief executive said at a press conference in Targu-Jiu.
Also on Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the Budapest government has decided to start preparations on the ground for the extension of the fence it is building on the border with Serbia to the Romanian border, to cope with a possible change in the route used by migrants.
Prime Minister Victor Ponta later stated that Hungary's decision to erect a fence at the border would solve nothing of the refugee problem and "scoot Hungary out of Europe".
What is the connection between Osama bin Laden and the collapse of the Makkah mackerel?
Saudi authorities have announced that the Saudi giant Binladin Group, owned by Osama bin Laden's family, is "partly responsible" for the crashing of a crane on Friday at the Great Mosque in Mecca, killing 107 people.
According to an investigation committee, the company failed to "comply with safety regulations", the Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported, the BBC reports.
The company's executives have been banned from leaving the country until the investigation is complete.
Also, the firm will be excluded from the new public contracts.
The construction company is owned by the family of former leader of the Al-Qaida terrorist network, Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden's father 80 years ago and is currently run by the brother of the former terrorist leader, Bakr.
Binladen Group has been working for four years to expand the Great Mosque to accommodate more pilgrims.
The accident occurred Friday night during a storm when a crane, probably unbalanced by strong gusts of wind, crashed into the eastern side of the roof of the Great Mosque in Mecca.
As a result of the accident, 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured.
How Hagi silenced the protesters
Considered by many the greatest Romanian footballer in history, Gica Hagi was labeled, after his retirement from active football, as a weak coach, who may not be able to perform in the new posture.
After unfortunate experiences at the national team, Steaua or Galatasaray, Hagi took over, a year ago, the role of coach at the Future Constanta, the team he patronizes.
Exactly one year after taking over the team, the King has demonstrated that he is capable of transforming a team that was struggling to save from relegation into a top-flight team.
So after a year, the Future has recorded, with Hagi as coach, 16 wins, 11 draws and 11 defeats.
The balance sheet is one of a top team, playing in European Cups.
Things took an even better turn for Futuro this season, as the team finished second in Ligue 1, with 19 points, one less than leader Astra Giurgiu.
The future also has the best attack in Ligue 1, with 20 goals (equal to Astra), more than twice as many as Steaua.
On the other hand, even though he brought more experienced players to the team, Hagi continued the policy of promoting young players, and in the recent period in the starting team appeared names such as Ianis Hagi or Hodorogea.
The club's policy has made Futuro a team to be followed by teams from abroad, so Hagi sold this summer for 1.5 million euros - Ianis Hagi (Fiorentina - 1 million euros) and Alexandru Mitrita (Bari - 500 thousand euros).
Next to the Stars, the Future is the only profitable team in League One, according to the Trade Register.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has played so far as a small country.
It's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated like the seventh country in the EU.
Big countries are coming up with solutions for the EU as a whole, says Cristian Ghinea, member of the board of directors of the Roman Centre for European Policies.
In an interview with Ziare.com, Cristian Guinea pointed out that Europe cannot be turned into a fortress and that purely political means will not work in this crisis: "Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values these people bring".
But there are masses that have started and we can't turn back history.
Migration is a reality that we have to adapt to as best we can and adapt them to us.
In the opinion of Cristian Guinea, we are in a very emotional moment, when politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
Once it passes, Europeans will not be willing to give up free movement, but the rules in the Schengen area must be changed: 'Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and not adapted for the current situation.'
Where are we in the refugee crisis after this JAI council that actually solved nothing?
It's clear that the EC President in agreement with Donald Tusk did not want to force a vote in the council.
All the forecasts said he'd have the votes.
Before the Treaty of Lisbon, the principle of unanimity applied in the JHA and any State could block any decision.
Therefore, there has been very little integration in the area of justice and home affairs.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure applies, where the EC takes the initiative and the Council approves it with 55% of the votes of the 16 Member States, representing 65% of the EU population.
The calculations said the votes existed.
But they didn't want to go ahead.
Because it's a sensitive issue, there was a backlash even in Germany against Chancellor Merkel's openness policy and they didn't want it to be seen in many countries as a "EU is sending migrants on our heads" reaction.
So they've delayed, but the problem remains because obviously this wave is creating a huge problem for the Schengen governance and we're probably going to see big changes there in the next period.
So the mandatory quotas weren't really eliminated, but the subject was just left to cool down?
Yes, on the other hand, there is talk of a greater involvement of the Frontex agency in the management of the external borders, which means a shift from the individual responsibility of the members at the Schengen external border to the responsibility of the Community agencies.
Greece's border with Turkey is also Germany's border with Turkey, de facto, and this wave of migrants has given the old Schengen system its limits.
Maybe he'll abandon the Dublin principle, whereby migrants are the responsibility of the state they first enter, because it's not sustainable.
If Greece is a chauvinist, you can't say it's Greece's business.
The problem is common.
Just because the problem is common, is it possible to solve it without a precise, perhaps even mandatory, mechanism for sharing the effort of receiving?
Nobody knows exactly how mandatory quotas will work, if they ever get to them.
Because there's a problem: what do you do with a man who doesn't want to come to Romania or Portugal, but to Sweden or Germany?
I don't think European countries will take up migrants: you go to country X or country Y.
It's probably going to end up in some one-stop filtering centers, in Greece or Turkey, where asylum applications are processed.
They're working on solutions like this.
But the problem has no simple solution.
There are countries that have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, there are countries that have no experience at all, like Romania, where the migrant problem will increase the current xenophobic trend.
What is certain is that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, in Lebanon, in Jordan, who are in precarious camps and who have just begun to leave for Europe.
One estimate is that only 10% have been able to leave, in winter it's hard to cross the Mediterranean, but we expect next year a wave maybe even bigger.
What do we do with these people?
My prediction is that we'll get used to this problem, we won't look at it as so catastrophic in the media.
You were talking about countries with less or more experience.
Does it seem to you that there is any place where it has really succeeded in integrating large groups from an extra-European culture?
I look at the Maghreb in France, the Turks in Germany, they're still enclaved.
I wouldn't go for any radical statements.
Of course, their integration is more difficult than other waves of migration, but that doesn't mean they don't integrate at all.
It's left an unintegrated part that creates major social problems in France, in Germany, in Britain.
But purely police means won't work.
Forging Europe is an illusion.
We must look at the mechanisms for integration into European societies.
There's been some mistakes here.
We need to be more demanding.
Let's ask these people to learn the language, to try to adopt the values, to stop staying with one foot in Europe and one in their home country, bringing the rest of their family, including through convenience marriages.
But the immediate problem of these people must be separated from the long-term problem of their integration.
If others have failed in long-term integration, it doesn't mean we have to watch them drown in the Mediterranean.
Maybe we're questioning the quality of the values these people bring.
And if there's going to be an intervention in Syria, which I don't believe, it doesn't mean that the country will be rebuilt overnight and you can take them back.
Until solutions appear, we see fortresses within Europe.
Borders have been closed, walls have been erected, border controls have been reintroduced in the Schengen area.
Is the European project in danger?
The European project as such, no, the Schengen area as it was built, yes.
It was built pretty minimal and arranging the rules so that the pressure was too much on the countries where these migrants first set foot.
I mean, we're all out there, but we're all in this together.
In the face of such a wave, it cannot be done, because some countries cannot cope.
When there's this kind of emotional surge, politicians want to look like they're doing something, but in the long run, it doesn't change much.
After the attacks in France, we don't have a much more draconian anti-terrorism legislation in the EU than we had last year.
There's a wave of public emotion going in both directions.
And it's so unstable from one week to the next that you can't make decisions based on it.
We've got a lot of talk, a lot of bellicose statements from politicians at home under pressure to be manly.
And then you have the dramatic case of the drowned child in Turkey and the public is moved.
Once the public emotion is over, we'll go back to why we created this space, this freedom of movement that's not just for people, but for goods.
This is the real single European market.
And I don't think Europeans will give up on this principle of freedom of movement.
That there will be other rules is another.
Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and not adapted to the situation now.
How has Romania played so far in this crisis?
Like a small country, which thinks that if you pull the plug and plug your ears, the theme disappears.
Faced with the reality of the migrant waves, you can choose to be part of the solution or say it's not your little country problem.
We did that, it's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated like the seventh country in the EU.
No, you're not playing at the major-league level.
The big countries are coming up with solutions for the whole EU, good or bad, we're not talking about their quality.
Just like Poland did.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the appetite of the Romanians for Schengen will decrease greatly.
President Iohannis says it's probably a good thing we haven't entered yet.
So we're moving from desperate entry to a more pragmatic position, but the goal remains.
There is of course a risk if Romania and Bulgaria enter Schengen that migrants will see us as an alternative route.
Which is not to say that it's a reason not to join Schengen, but to be more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but transformed in the sense that the external borders will become a shared responsibility, there will be single rules for accepting migrants, single rules for deporting those who do not receive asylum, single rules for countries considered safe.
The Ukrainian president was saying that after Russia shifted its focus to Syria, no one died in Ukraine.
Is there a link between the two outbreaks, a Russian game?
Russia has a frustrated power behaviour.
She thinks being a great power is about getting the Americans and the Europeans in trouble.
In that respect, yes, there is a connection.
Without the Putin regime's military and financial effort, the Assad regime would probably have collapsed long ago.
And it was good to fall before its main opponent was the Islamic State.
For two years there has been a struggle between the Assad regime and secular and moderate Muslim militias, backed by the Gulf states and the West.
Then ISIS came along, and now we don't know if we want the Assad regime to fall.
Russia may have complicated things, but it can't be part of the solution.
It creates foci of instability and chaos that it cannot close.
But you're only powerful if you have solutions.
Playing off-side is just a strategy to buy time.
Putin is probably waiting for offers to be made, for him to push the buttons to resolve the situation.
The offers don't come because the world isn't convinced that he can somehow solve issues that he created.
But I don't agree with theories that these people are being ruled by an invisible hand.
Let's not see Putin more powerful than he is.
What button will appear soon
Millions of Facebook users have become accustomed to the "Like" button, and now the social network is preparing another opposite, the "Dislike" button.
On Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg, the company's co-founder and CEO, announced on his account that the button will be available soon, the New York Times reports on its blog.
Zuckerberg has stated that the "Dislike" button will show a nuance of what a user is feeling rather than just an option.
However, his announcement raised the issue that Facebook could become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg mentioned that he wants to avoid the moments when someone posts on his account or an important life event, and someone else will "dislike".
Users of the network, which has reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long demanded the ability to express their negative emotions or empathise with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg also said that it's not very comfortable for people to like current events, like the refugee crisis, or the death of a family member.
"You might not feel comfortable liking that post", Facebook spokesperson pointed out.
The new Facebook button was not well received by everyone.
"There is already enough hate on Facebook and social media", Atiq Haneef of Afghanistan commented on the New York Times Facebook page, where the article was posted.
"I'm going to dislike the dislike button", he said.
Roger Anderson, a microbiologist in Atlanta, argued that there's nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different opinions on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, social media analyst at eMarketer, mentioned that it's hard to imagine that a single button can convey a complex range of negative emotions.
Moreover, she argues, the election campaign is approaching in America, and the "Dislike" button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees entered Hungary in 24 hours
Hungary accepted only 70 migrants on Tuesday, a handful of the thousands who poured in at its southern border with Serbia, government adviser Gyorgy Bakondi announced.
Hungary declared a state of emergency during the day in two counties along the border with Serbia due to the flow of refugees, closing a major border crossing point and announcing that it will build a fence on its border with Romania, DPA recalls.
The measure drew a sharp reaction from Serbia.
They said yesterday they'd seal the border for those who want to cross, but not for those who want to seek asylum.
"As you can see, this is totally different", said the Serbian Minister for Refugees, Aleksandar Vulin.
Before the new immigration law was imposed, a record 5,809 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, police said on Monday.
In addition, more than 170,000 migrants from the Middle East and Africa entered Hungary from Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid registration and try to reach the West, especially Germany.
The "new" county council headquarters is about to collapse.
Two builders insolvent
The massive investment made here in recent years to move the institution is about to fall apart because it has been stalled several times.
Two major builders who worked here went bankrupt during the works.
The seat of the County Council in Vasile Alecsandri Street will end up collapsing on its own.
A year and a half after the building's consolidation and re-functioning had been due to be completed, the work was not even half done.
A final step in the building's epic was taken the other day when the National Dispute Resolution Council (NDRC) rejected a complaint from a firm seeking to take over the technical design contract for the work still to be carried out.
The initial project was prepared by Impex Romcatel SA.
Following the insolvency of the constructor and the interruption of the works, negotiations were initiated without the publication of a participation notice with Impex Romcatel, which was to update the technical project and then organise a new tender for the works.
'The negotiations did not end in a contract, however, as the CJ considered that the proposed form would have disadvantaged the institution,' summed up Răzvan Timofciuc, public relations representative at the CJ.
The CJ's decision to stop direct negotiations was challenged in court by Impex Romcatel.
The Ischia Tribunal forwarded the complaint to the CNSC, which rejected it as late.
That doesn't mean CJ can start looking for another designer.
Impex Romcatel has the possibility to challenge the CNSC decision at the Court of Appeal, only after a final judgment of the Court of Appeal and consideration may be given to finding another designer.
The building's consolidation work could thus be resumed as early as next year.
Our intention is to resume the works as soon as possible.
In principle, the reworking of the technical project should not take long, but we need to reach a conclusion of a contract.
"We are waiting to see whether the decision of the CNSC will be challenged or not", Timofciuc said.
The consolidation of the former headquarters of the Police Chest began in 2011.
A first works contract was terminated in April 2012, after works of RON 4.5 million had been carried out.
The tender was resumed and the contract was awarded to Moldoconstruct SA.
However, the company went into insolvency, and this contract was terminated, after payments of 1,5 million lei had been made.
The work has been completed by about 50%.
Initially, the works of consolidation, re-functioning and attic of the building had been valued at 7,7 million lei.
"I'm done, I'm done!" - the statement that could incriminate the former head of the Cadastral
One of the employees involved in the scandal of the Cadastral Office file signed a plea agreement, against a suspended prison sentence.
Most likely, his statements will incriminate the other defendants, led by former boss, Narciza Nedelcu
A consultant at the Office of Real Estate Cadastral and Advertising (OCPI) who had been accused by DNA in a corruption case has admitted his deeds.
The agreement on the recognition of the facts signed by Dumitru Dascălu was registered yesterday at the Iași Tribunal, with the judges determining to give a decision in this case on 29 September.
Dumitru Daniel Dascălu was charged with continuous intellectual misconduct and agreed to serve two years of probation and community service.
As regards the facts charged against Dascalou, the prosecutors stated that he, as an adviser to the Cadastral Office, together with other colleagues, 'falsified several acceptance minutes, omitting the service contracts previously concluded by O.C.P.I. Iași with the managers of SC Gauss SRL, SC Cinci SRL Group, SC Topo Euro SRL, SC Cad Cad Cad Agenzia de Cadru and Topografie SRL and PFA Lipșa Ștefan, who falsely attested that the contracted services were performed in full, under conditions in which they were not performed and not deposited with O.C.P.I. Iași'.
In the past few days, the former head of the Office, Narciza Nedelcu, as well as other former or current employees of OCPI were sent to trial in this case, the charges being the payment of some services to the aforementioned firms, although the works were not carried out.
The damage is in excess of RON 300 000.
Adventures in the Stone Age
In the opinion of the FRH president, Alexandru Dedu, Romania can host a major handball competition only in 2024, and preparing the women's national handball team for qualification to the Olympic Games costs a fortune.
The president of the Romanian Handball Federation, Alexandru Dedu, said yesterday, during a meeting with the press, that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the Champions League groups.
As for the Romanian women's national handball team, "the main objective is to qualify for the Olympic Games in Rio, but for that they have to go through two stages of caudine forks, firstly the World Championship and secondly the pre-qualification tournament", Dedu said.
We really want to qualify for the Olympics.
There are some fantastic demands from the technical staff led by Tomas Ryde.
Staff that will be composed of seven or eight people.
He wants an assistant coach, a doctor, two masseurs, goalkeeping coach, a physical trainer, head of the delegation.
They asked us for qualifying things, specifically fitness materials, that we'd never heard of.
All to get to the Olympics, and I'll do whatever it takes to get there.
We're talking about a massive investment, there's a lot of money.
But that's the way to perform.
Because right now we're in the stone age with preparation.
"The teams we're fighting have these materials and have had them for some time", said Dedu, who mentioned that they're trying to get the sums needed to purchase these products from MTS and COSR.
The President of the FRH also referred to the infrastructure in Romania and the possibility of our country hosting a major handball competition.
We don't have a gym in Bucharest.
It's an infrastructure issue and it's a shame that a European Gymnastics Championship is being called into question.
Let's not forget that in other parts of the world, entire Olympic venues were built within two years.
Before 1992, the current Olympic site in Barcelona was a garbage dump, and now it's a beauty landmark.
The same happened in London, where the 2012 Olympic Games were a success in terms of investment.
"In my vision, in 2024 we can host a major competition", Dedu said.
He added that international handball bodies are willing to grant Romania the hosting of a major competition.
For me it's a priority to bring major handball competitions to Romania.
Mr. Gatsu went civilized with a project, people agreed in principle, but it became clear very quickly that the hall would never be built.
And I had discussions with the EHF, I told them that we want, that we are able to organize and they said that they are in agreement and invite them to the first match in the new hall in Bucharest and then we talk concretely.
"So we have all the openness, both at EHF and IHF, but we don't have the infrastructure", the FRH official explained.
The former great handballer avoided evaluating the chances of the women's teams CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare to reach the Final Four: "I asked all the coaches to be reserved in the forecasts, that if they do not fulfill they turn against them".
Good road to the World Cup
Romanian rugby players debut on September 23 against France
The captain of the national rugby team, Mihai Macovei, said on Tuesday, in a press conference, that all the members of Romania's squad are ready for the World Cup matches in England, where they hope to achieve two victories: "We are ready".
Both my colleagues and I are running the engines at full speed.
We've been training to get the best performance in the four games.
Everyone will have high expectations, because our goal is to win in two games, against Canada and Italy.
All the groups are heavy and ours is the same.
Let's take it easy, first with France and then we'll see.
But for sure, if we win with Canada, the match with Italy will be our final.
I can't describe in words the joy of participating in the World Cup, it's the culmination of so many years of work.
I wish we didn't disappoint anyone in the rugby family and come home with a good result.
"We want you to be proud that some players, a small family like rugby in Romania, proudly represent the tricolor", Macovei said.
The coach of the Romanian national team, Lynn Howells, who is in his first experience as a coach at the World Cup, hopes to make the Romanians proud of the rugby team: "It is a great honor for us to participate in this World Cup".
I'm sure the players are ready to participate in the tournament.
It's a great experience for me.
It's very important for me that at every match I make the Romanians proud of the national team.
The President of the Romanian Rugby Federation, Haralambie Dumitraș, is confident that Romanian players can confirm the progress made in recent years in rugby.
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made at the national team.
I wish the athletes success and I am confident that we will be at the top of the event.
"These guys started playing in the Romanian teams around 18-19 years old, so there is cohesion, it's a band of friends, who set themselves to realize a dream", said Dumitraş.
At the Rugby World Cup in England, Romania will progress to Group D, having scheduled the following matches: with France, on 23 September in London; with Ireland, on 27 September in London; with Canada, on 6 October in Leicester; with Italy, on 11 October in Exeter.
The competition starts on Friday at Twickenham Stadium in London with England and Fiji in Group A.
New Japanese culture classes organized at "Al.I. Cuza" University

14 million lei to the "Sv. Spiridon" Hospital in Iaşi for the budget rectification
What will he buy with this substantial sum of money?
The hospital "Sv. Spiridon" received from the Ministry of Health, following the budget rectification, about 14 million lei.
The money received by the medical unit to be used by the end of the year will be invested in the upgrading and refurbishment of some clinics, as well as in medical equipment and equipment for which the hospital has already started the public procurement procedure.
The unit will be equipped with a new CT computer, a new radiology apparatus, six surgical kits, six suitably equipped ATI beds, an ophthalmic microscope and other medical equipment.
On the other hand, 5 million lei of the money received by the hospital will be directed to the construction and renovation of the "Great Ars".
From the money from the budget rectification, UPU will receive 500,000 lei for the completion of the modernization works in the main tronson.
"In addition, in the next few days we will be receiving the works from the walkway that connects the UPU with the cardiology, hepatology and gastroenterology clinics to ensure the decent transportation of the patient from the UPU to the neighboring clinics", the medical unit manager further explained.
The hospital will soon have in the courtyard and the Dermatology Clinic in Tatarasi, which will be organized in the outpatient setting, under the same form under which it currently operates.
The clinic will operate in the area where the outpatient allergology, hematology and endocrinology are located and will have approximately 30 beds.
The coward, made fun of by the RATP controllers and a flyer.
The tourist's fate
A family of tourists from Cluj came to Iasi to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
After the experience I have lived, neither I nor my wife want to set foot in your city ever again.
They were unwittingly hit by the misinformation in the flyers, the insubordination of the RAPT controllers and, bonus, a "as the law says" fine.
The couple arrived in Iasi a few days ago, stayed in a hotel in the city centre and asked for tourist flyers.
They also received a leaflet that included the RATP routes.
Armed with these maps, the husbands visited Iasi.
But two days ago, in Copou, they wanted to get to the Palace Mall.
Since there was no ticket bucket at the station near Copou Park, they relied on the information printed on the flyer: that they could get a ticket by text message.
Nobody told them this service was no more.
Confident in the flyer, they boarded a bus and tried to text the instructions on the flyer.
Unfortunately for them, a team of RATP controllers showed up.
They said the service had been out for two years and that it had been announced in the press that it had been canceled.
How do I know what the local press is saying about me coming in the evening before I visit the city?
I talked to the controllers, explained the situation, they said they didn't care, it's none of their business.
The attitude was very defiant.
They said all they could do was give us one ticket instead of two (me and my wife).
"I paid, I didn't want to ruin my day by visiting the gendarmerie stand and making statements there!", says Ovidiu.
In conclusion, the family was fined because of the wrong information on the flyer and the controllers who "applied the law to blood".
It's not fair, and I made a subpoena to RATP to get my money back.
It's not about the money, I'm not exaggerating many, but the point is that I felt cheated.
Bad luck for the rapists in Vaslui.
They had an accident and were remanded in custody.
The trial of the seven rapists from Vaslui has moved, since yesterday, to the Court of Appeal of Iași.
The first trial was held in a private session where the seven young men accused of molesting an 18-year-old girl demanded their release.
Before the actual start of the hearing, one of the Isen judges to whom the case had been assigned, Viorel Munteanu, made a request to abstain, which was accepted by his colleagues at the court.
The Magistrate worked until the summer of this year at the Vaslui Tribunal, where he was the President of the Criminal Section, and on 9 April he admitted a challenge by four of the defendants, ordering their house arrest.
The case is currently being tried by a panel of Magistrates Maricica Mititelu and Geta Sandu.
Earlier in the case, Judge Dan Anton also abstained on the grounds that his daughter was in a cohabitation relationship with one of the lawyers for the rapists.
The two judges decided that the rapists at Vaslui should remain in custody.
The teenagers will remain in detention for at least another 30 days, when the judges will re-examine the possibility of their release.
The next hearing will take place at the Court of Appeal in Iași on 6 October.
Before reaching the Court of Appeal of Iaşi, the van in which the rapists from Vaslui were transported was involved in an accident in the neighborhood of Păcurari, the car entering Iaşi on the belt.
The Iveco truck carrying the seven rapists hit a Volkswagen car coming out of Canta Street, and the driver tried to turn left.
The van was driving from the end of the Pacura.
The car entered Iasi through here because the prison administration employees preferred the route from Vaslui to Iasi to Grajduri, then the belt road.
They cut the road a few miles.
Immediately after the impact, the arrest escort called another transport to pick up the prisoners.
Soon a car from the Iaşi High Security Penitentiary was sent to the scene of the accident, which picked up the seven inmates and transported them to the Court of Appeal.
As a result of the accident, none of the arrested were injured.
To transfer them to the other van, the guards surrounded the back of the cars, and the arrested people came out in pairs.
"The incident was not reported to the police because the drivers of the two vehicles had agreed amicably on the damages to be paid", said IPJ Chief Commissioner Madalyn Taranu.
Large migrations
Romania is not and will not be prepared for what is to come.
What about Europe?
I say it from the beginning, clearly and loudly: the 7,000 refugees that Romania should and must naturalize is, in itself, an insignificant number, but huge compared to the capacity of the Romanian state to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, of about 1500 souls, far exceeds the good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Certainly, if those migrants really accept to settle in our localities, the chances of their rapid integration into Romanian society are extraordinarily small.
I'm sure they'll be the first to lose their patience.
Paralysed by the interlopers and paralyzed by a venal political class, the Romanian state proves impotent in all areas.
The inability to integrate the gypsies is just a banal example.
In addition, governments of any color have been unable to absorb European funds, build modern roads, kindergartens or schools, provide decent health care, clean up street dirt, create decent-paying jobs, or keep their own young generation at home.
Why would refugees settle in another country they're fleeing?
But what is especially astonishing is the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is treated.
We first hit upon the bellicose hypocrisy of the powerful EU states, who are most generous in sharing their troubles with the smaller countries.
Then there is the fearful hypocrisy of Romanians who, although they have millions of relatives scattered all over the world, still do not accept the other - of another language, another religion, another blood.
Probably afraid someone will steal their national being.
Finally, there is the hypocrisy of many migrants, who, while citing only the horrors of war as a reason for leaving, do not accept any other destination of exodus than Germany or the Nordic countries.
Now, not all refugees are Syrians, and there is no war in Pakistan.
Also, the simplistic way in which the crisis is analyzed can only be ridiculed.
The causes must be eliminated, some argue, and, betting strictly on political correctness, they call for peace and investment for the migrants' countries of origin.
But there is peace in Romania and even more foreign capital enters the national economy from time to time - but that doesn't stop tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country every year.
Why is he leaving?
In this crisis, the European Union has revealed itself to us as a construct that is broken, broken and outdated.
I was lamenting that Romania is not able to invent a country project, but here we are, the EU has no future plan either.
And improvisation and threats are not helping.
What good is the EU then, if the only advantage that Romanians enjoyed - the right to free movement - could be called into question because of the waves of refugees crossing the borders like cheese?
At some point, the war in Syria will end.
Not the migrant crisis, though.
Over the next few decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource depletion, etc. will push millions of desperate migrants from Asia and especially Africa towards a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is not and will never be ready for what is to come.
7,000 euros a year to rent the Pogor Club.
The destination, practically, imposed
The tender for the concession covers a period of 10 years.
After 7 years of being closed, the club in the courtyard of the Museum of Romanian Literature is offered by the County Council for concession for a period of 10 years.
The construction has a usable area of 134 sqm, on two tiers of roubles.
The CJ shall accept as the building's intended use only the literary café, the bookshop or other cultural activities.
The building was valued at EUR 68 300, with a starting bid of EUR 6 830 per year, with a bidding stage of EUR 25.
The concessionaire will have to operate the building continuously and permanently and cover the full costs of rehabilitation of the property, in accordance with the technical project to be drawn up.
'The Club Pogor building is in an advanced state of deterioration due to the fact that during the period when the public supply unit operated in these spaces and even after its evacuation, no routine repair and maintenance works were carried out as are currently required during the operation of a building', it is stated in the documentation relating to the tender procedure.
The club's concession bids are expected until September 18.
Two brothers from Tomesti swallowed sleeping pills.
They were taken to the hospital
Two nine- and 11-year-old children in Tomeşti, brothers, swallowed several Diazepam pills.
They found the pills in the house and took them out of curiosity.
Their mother was on treatment, and the drugs weren't hidden.
The children were rushed to St. Mary's Hospital in Iasi.
They're stable, as the doctors say.
A date that breaks your heart.
At 20 years old, he received a courageous gift: biological parents.
Lost in a hospital under unclear conditions in the gloom of the '90s, when she was only two months old, small, sick and helpless, and then adopted by a wealthy family in Italy, in the same years when adoption was loosely regulated, a young Ischia, now a beautiful blonde girl, was reunited the other day in Iaşi with her birth parents from a rural county, after almost two decades in which nobody knew anything about the others.
Crina will be 20 years old today, and her adoptive parents in Palermo have thought of giving their beloved daughter an amazing and courageous gift: a visit to Romania, to Iași, to learn about her obscure past.
The "Gazette de Iasi", which witnessed the search for the family of origin after some extremely vague clues, witnessed these meetings that practically break your heart.
The reporting by the reporters, the emotions of the moment, the statements of those involved, their reactions are truly moving and overwhelming.
Crina's story begins 20 years ago in the Ionian town of Ruginoasa, when she was only two months old.
Then, because of a health problem, the girl had to be admitted to the hospital in the city.
At home, there began to be disagreements between the parents, and Mother was forced to leave home.
He decided to keep the girl and send me away.
He stopped the girl, and I didn't know anything since.
"When I found out that she was in the hospital, it was too late", recalls Alina, the girl's biological mother, in mourning.
Crina was admitted with her grandmother to the municipal hospital in Pashkani, and at the same time the girl's father, Costica Balcan, went to work in the city of Alexandria, Teleorman County.
Their lives were about to be forever separated.
They never found Crina at the hospital.
After the internment, Crina's father went to work in another locality, and returned after six months.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Iasi, and when her father returned, he could not find her.
I think it was almost nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
"She must have thought she was abandoned", says one of the family's granddaughters.
Due to financial problems, Grandma could not come with Crina to Iasi, and the girl remained in the care of doctors.
Because no one was interested in the child's fate during this time, she was taken over by the Directorate General of Social Assistance and Child Protection of Iaşi, which then gave her to the care of the Placement Center in Bucium.
There were years when abandonment and adoption were less regulated than today in Romania.
At the Bucium Center she was found by the Italian Salvadore and his wife, a couple from Palermo who wanted to have their child but could not.
They immediately fell in love with the blonde Crina, and after a while she would move permanently with them to Italy.
The little girl was almost two years old when the adoption formalities took place.
When we saw Crina, we felt like she was our girl.
"It was as if my wife had given birth to her", says smiling Salvadore, the adoptive father, as he grabs the girl's hands in his palm.
In the country, Crina's parents, Alina and Costica, continued their searches separately, each where they could.
The father asked the authorities in Ruginoasa, but received no answer where his child might be.
The police then told her that she might have died, but in Iaşi the parents found out what really happened to their daughter.
When I looked for her here, they told me at the courthouse that she'd gone to Italy, to Palermo.
And the conditions to look for her I didn't have.
We prayed to God that he would be well.
I've thought about it all these years, but there's been no chance for us to walk around, to find it.
"It's hard", Crina's birth mother tells us with tears in her eyes.
But even as the years passed, the parents of Ruginoasa were not forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and his wife explained to the girl where she came from and that her past linked her to Romania.
I was a little girl when I found out.
I think I was five or six.
I reacted like a child, I was curious.
"I wanted to meet my Romanian parents", says happy Crina.
And her dream was about to come true.
In March of this year, Chief Commissioner Ichim Romică, director of the Regional Centre for Prevention, Evaluation and Counselling against Drugs Iași, was contacted by an acquaintance in Italy, who explained to him Salvadore's desire to find Crine's biological family.
And the search started with just one name.
Following the request from our Italian partners, we started the first steps.
We'd just gotten a name, Balkan Costic, then the locality, Rust.
Soon I had an activity with the city hall there, and I could ask if there was a name received locally.
Then they gave me some clues, only the person they found wasn't the one they were looking for.
"It took about a month to find the girl's biological father", explains Chief Commissioner Ichim.
In all, it took the authorities more than three months to find Costica and Alina, especially since they were living in different localities.
We started the process in March, and in June-July, we finished identifying the biological parents and the discussions.
"Then we arranged for a first meeting in September", Roman Ichim added.
Last weekend, Alina and Costica saw their daughter for the first time, lost in the halls of the hospital in Iaşi 20 years ago.
The father was so moved that he could hardly hold back his tears, and his hands were constantly shaking.
He barely exchanges a few words with the people around him.
A week before the meeting, he couldn't sleep.
He was all excited, shaking.
"To see your child after all these years is something", says a granddaughter, who also came with Costica from Ruginoasa.
Crina meets her mother and biological brother
In his discussions with his daughter, who is going to study at a top-ranked university in Italy, Costica Balcan told her, among other things, that if she ever wanted to return to him in the village, she should come quietly: she could give him some sheep, goats, so that she could find a boy in the village and start a household.
My mother is also very emotional, crying, and she can hardly believe that this could happen to her.
I'm very excited.
I never thought this could happen.
I've seen cases like this on TV, I've been thinking about it all these years, I've been hoping, but I never thought I could be like this.
There are very big emotions.
If they could forgive me.
I hope we can visit in the future.
"I hope we can keep in touch", says Alina, Crina's mother, with tears in her eyes, as she holds a napkin tightly in her hand.
In it she hides her tears of joy, for soon she will see her face after so bitter a time.
On the other hand, Crina, who will be 20 in just a few days this month, is trying to calm down like an emotional child.
She doesn't know what to expect, but she's sketched out a vague idea about her biological parents.
He thinks they're young, but now before the meeting he tries to gather his thoughts, because he has so much to say, but nothing to reproach.
My parents are two moms and two dads.
But my parents are the ones who raised me after all.
It's going to be a beautiful meeting, a wonderful experience.
"I hope I have a good memory of them, because there is so much to tell now", says Crina.
First family reunion in Iaşi
In the Piazza dell'Unità, under the sky of early autumn, the family from Ruginoasa reunites their destiny with their daughter from Palermo.
Crina is now 20 years old, finishing high school, following the Italian school model, but she can start a new chapter with Alina and Costica, her biological parents.
There are no longer borders or countries, only a barrier: the barrier of language.
And with the help of a translator, an Italian who owns a place in the center of Iaşi, they got through it with ease.
Those who have made this meeting possible say that it is the first event of its kind ever held, and that in the future, if the opportunity arises, they will do it again.
It's the first event of its kind organized, with such an emotional load, and I'm glad it's a success.
We at the Centre have different activities, and we are often associated as an institution that deals only with people who use drugs, people who are addicted to drugs.
But we're trying to give society something good back.
"If I am asked to participate in such an event again, I will gladly do so", says Romika Ichim, director of the Regional Center for Drug Prevention, Evaluation and Counseling in Iaşi, smiling.
Behind him, the Balkan family, with Crina in the middle, parting ways telling their stories.
They're understandable: they have a lot to say to each other.
Armistice at the feet yesterday at the PSD.
Everybody pulls their own weight
The camps of the PSD branch in Iasi have concluded a ceasefire with a gun in their legs.
After successive rounds of talks, from Friday to Sunday, the first and most tense, the PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
Pressed by the party's executive president, Liviu Dragnea, to present a united position, the Social Democrats of Iasi will send him a full list of potential candidates for party positions.
Far from over, the war within the party seems to have taken a break to allow the fighters to breathe.
Dragnea did not give an ultimatum.
He sent a very simple and very timely message in the current circumstances: try to find a solution so as not to endanger the party.
On October 3rd, we have a party election.
All functions will be made available to those who wish them.
"Until then, we remain in the existing structure", said the acting mayor, Mihai Chirica.
The two days of discussions over the weekend only led to the conclusion that nothing definite has been established.
In the October elections, a fierce competition is expected for the post of president of the PSD's county branch.
The short list of possible candidates for the main position in the Isan branch of the party includes state secretary Maricel Popa, senator Florin Constantinescu, senator Sorin Lazăr, county councillor Vasile Câtea and interim president of the County Council, Victorel Lupu.
The mayor of Schitu Duca, Mihai Mihalache, could be added to this.
A variant taken into account is the candidacy of the leader of the PSD county councillors, Cristian Stanciu, if Lupu will no longer register in the race, sources within the party stating that he is not interested in the position.
The only name that has not been mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in recent days is that of the former head of the branch, Mayor Gheorghe Nichita.
The list of candidates is open.
According to the statute, even on election day, candidates can be nominated, and it wouldn't surprise anyone if it happened.
"The important thing is that we remain united, and we will remain united after October 3, when we will have a new Executive Office, a new County Permanent Office and all new leadership structures", he said.
Until the internal elections, the leadership of the PSD's county branch will be provided by Victorel Lupu, a close associate of Nichita and Stanciu.
Lupu is on leave until September 29, however, and the preparation of the elections will be practically provided by the executive secretary of the branch, County Councilor Mihail Popescu, who has cold relations with the Nichita camp.
Contacted by telephone, Cristian Stanciu described the discussions of the last days as leading to "a partial consensus".
There is a wide willingness to maintain balance and unity in the party.
A partial consensus was reached in favour of a unified team to handle the county.
"But on the other hand, there are several variations on the intentions related to the candidacy for the presidency of PSD Iași, the list remaining open", Stanciu commented.
A judge from Iasi has rejected the case of the rapists in Vaslui on grounds of concubinage
The seven young men from Vaslui County convicted of rape arrive today at the Court of Appeal of Iași.
The Vasluians, who were sentenced to terms ranging from five years to eight months and eight years and four months, will present their arguments for their release today, after the court of first instance, the Vaslui Court, ordered their imprisonment immediately after the sentencing.
The file was filed in the Court of Appeal late last week, with Magistrate Dan Anton forming a motion for a stay, which his colleagues accepted.
Anton has relied on the fact that one of the defendants' lawyers, lawyer Bogdan Luca, is the concubine of his daughter, lawyer Dana Anton.
Luca defends Silviu Ovidiu Burada, who received the highest punishment in this case.
How the Judges Reasoned
Late last week, the magistrate at the Vaslui Court who sentenced the seven young men gave reasons for the sentence.
In his motivation, the judge speaks of the defiant reaction of the defendants and those who supported them, stating that such attitudes create a strong sense of indignation among the public opinion.
'The Court finds that after the time of placing under the preventive measure of judicial control, a measure restrictive of liberty but not depriving of liberty, under the impact of the attitude of the defendants, their families and local supporters, a strong feeling of indignation was felt at the local and national level about the fact that persons accused of serious crimes are tried under a less restrictive measure,' the reasoning of the Vaslui Court states.
The magistrates also dismantled the main defence of the seven defendants who during the trial argued that the girl they raped was not a "church door".
'The Court stresses that the moral quality of the injured person is irrelevant, which the defendants wished to highlight in their defence, since the physical and sexual freedom of a person cannot be infringed under any pretext,' the statement of grounds states.
Corbyn, Brexit and the future of Europe
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they have enjoyed in recent decades cannot continue in the years to come.
Until Saturday probably few people in Romania knew who Jeremy Corbyn was.
Even today, after he became the new leader of the Labour Party in Britain, many are wondering how much the election of a politician who is not in a decision-making position can affect us.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical left-wing Labour leader since the war.
An avowed Marxist, anti-monarchist (he once urged Tony Blair, then prime minister, to remove the royal family from Buckingham Palace), a fierce anti-American and a supporter of Vladimir Putin (he was also regularly invited to comment on political events by the "Russia Today" television channel), and of the terrorist movements Hezbollah and Hamas, he wants Britain to give up nuclear weapons and leave NATO and the EU.
For Corbyn, who at the time considered the killing of Osama bin Laden a real tragedy, ISIS is almost the preferred choice of the United States.
Following the pattern of all populist demagogues, Corbyn has, of course, miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
The kind of things that Tsipras said and promised in Greece until he faced the real world and economic legitimacy.
The new Labour leader's economic programme includes massive re-nationalization and printing money as a solution to finance development projects and cover very generous social benefits.
Sure, some might wonder why the solution of printing money is not adopted unanimously around the globe, we would then have a global general prosperity!, but who would be stumbled by such details.
Sure, we can tax the bankers on blood, you become a kind of enemy of the left, but as we've seen so many times in the past, not just in the former communist states or Ecuador or Venezuela, but in France, at the beginning of the Mitterrand and Hollande mandates.
The extra money is quickly swallowed up by the generous, uncovered promises made by populist demagogues.
As Margaret Thatcher so aptly pointed out, "the problem with socialism is that at some point you run out of other people's money".
Few give Jeremy Corbyn any real chance of ever becoming Prime Minister.
In the early 1980s another radical leftist leader, Michael Foot, who was not as extreme in convictions as the new party leader, failed miserably in the election.
And then there was still a working class in Britain, in the classic sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And the unions were considerably more influential than they are now.
In the new industrial landscape, where services dominate the workforce as a whole and extensive automation has led to a massive need for highly skilled labour in industry, Corbyn's rhetoric has limited appeal.
But even from opposition, he can influence important developments that can affect us directly.
In its latest issue, the Financial Times believes that Corbyn's election increases the chances of Brexit, or Britain leaving the EU.
The new Labour leader has been a consistent opponent of the country's membership of the Union.
In the eyes of the radical left, Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalisation that has imposed austerity on the poor.
When you combine this kind of thinking with the radical right, with anti-immigration rhetoric, and you look at the refugee crisis that is shaking the foundations of the EU, you get an explosive mix.
And not just for Britain.
But if the British decide, following the referendum, which is due to take place by 2017, to leave the Union, the symbolic loss of capital for the whole European project and the deep rifts created within it by the Euro crisis and now by the refugees, between North and South, between East and West, leaves room for the most worrying scenarios.
Moreover, for a whole series of Member States, London was a counterweight to the Franco-German axis (in which Berlin is becoming increasingly the dominant player).
It's true, the British business community, the City, are strong advocates of the country staying in the EU.
But Europe today is not the same as it was in the past.
There are many resentments, which are growing in intensity even in these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, we had a sample of it even recently in Jean Clude Juncker's speech, tends increasingly to take major decisions over the heads of the vast majority of Member States in consultation with only a few European powers, mainly Germany.
And this is happening at a time when electoral support for anti-establishment, anti-immigration and eurosceptic groups is growing dramatically across the continent.
In other words, the emotional climate with negative charges has reached higher rates than at any time in the past.
Hence the conclusion that the Financial Times draws when assessing the chances of Brexit.
The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation that departs from the national interest.
If the voters make the decision in their heads, then Britain will stay in the EU.
But Corbyn's victory reminds us of the power of emotion in politics today.
Eastern Europe may be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as is to be expected, we see a more pronounced integration of the euro area, which will push most of the states in the region to the periphery of the interest and decision-making process in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States are fueling their populist rhetoric from the accumulated frustrations of Western societies.
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they have enjoyed in recent decades, the generous social benefits, cannot continue in the years to come.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, Euro-zone - immigration, both caused by hasty decisions that have taken into account only integrationist political ambitions, not the capacity and readiness of the peoples and governments of Europe to respond to such challenges, the turbulence on the continent, the internal tensions in the EU will increase in intensity and may affect the situation of Romania more.
And it's hard to rule anything out in terms of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are capable of dealing with such complicated situations.
Constantine the Great, the peasant god.
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
Brâncuși: "Take and sweep the workshop!"
The great sculptor had a big dream: to be somebody, to become famous, to be heard all over the world.
But behind his fame is something almost forgotten today, when we are delivered millions of success stories, recipes for success in life.
That thing has a name.
It's called "trude".
What to write about Constantin Brancusi?
What else is there to say, really?
His face was on the bills.
And recently, a well-known bank in Romania hired an actor to play him in a commercial.
Brâncuşi has been producing and delivering money for almost 60 years since he's been gone.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards named after him.
And by the way, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
And when he goes outside with the baby, he hears the following instructions: "We're going to the park, to the Brancuchi".
The country is strewn with his statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known by so many people, from children to the elderly.
Brancusi's infiltration capability is a huge one.
Even the Communists could not erase it from the memory and culture of Romania.
His quotes are now spreading across the Internet, receiving hundreds of thousands of likes and shares.
And then again, what would there be to say, to write about this man?
Seen from the pile of books and articles trying to reconstruct his fate, Brancusi's life seems almost fantastic, totally improbable.
You know, there are those people who tell you that if you're not lucky enough to be born in a big city and in a family that's fairly wealthy, your chances of success in life are almost zero.
Brancusi's life is the perfect counterexample.
And maybe there'd be a key here.
Maybe that's where the next text should start.
With a sentence, however detestable they are.
Forget the stupid success stories that are delivered to you daily in the newspapers and on television.
Look closely at the figure of this man.
You want to know how he got on in life, how, today, he's heard by an entire world?
It's really simple.
He worked his whole life to be somebody.
That's what he did.
Constantin Brancuși was born on 19 February 1876, in Hobița, a small village in the municipality of Peștișani, Gorj County, at the foot of the Carpathians.
He is the fifth child of Maria and Radu Nicolae Brâncuși.
Although he came from a wealthy peasant family, Brancuşi led a modest life, but one that would gather the landmarks that would guide his later artistic vision.
Recalling his childhood and the places where he grew up, the artist would confess, in a meeting with Petre Tutsia, from Paris, in 1933: "At that time life was beautiful and harmonious".
For millennia, people have led happy, patriarchal lives.
Everything was quiet from one season to the next.
And you know why things changed?
The civilization of the great city has come down to us.
Brancusi's childhood was far from idyllic, however.
One of the moments spent in these early years of life is highly suggestive of the combination of purity and violence that characterized the future sculptor's years spent in his native locality.
The moment is reproduced in the work "Brâncuși. A biography", written by Alexandru Buican.
In 1879, Constantin Brancuşi was three years old.
In the autumn of that year, when the tea was being made "at the boiler", watching those who tasted the liquid to see if the process was going well, Brancuși caught a moment of general inattention.
They fill their palms with straw and drink on the breathless.
He falls asleep almost instantly.
The first people notice it after a few minutes.
The mother panics, then goes into hysteria, thinking her son is dead.
In the evening, when Radu, the father, returns from the vineyard with the bats, he sees in the distance the desperate signs of those who are waiting for him with their souls at their feet.
The party turns into mourning.
Father is already thinking about the funeral.
Yet, someone finds it convenient to call her Baba Brandy, the dowager and servant of the Brandy.
The spider checks the baby's breathing, then puts horse manure under his nose, collected from the surrounding area.
The strong sneeze child.
The world is cheering.
While the boy is left to sleep on his drunken, joyful way, the barbecue party continues with even greater force.
The next day, father and son meet in the field.
Radu Brancuși has Constantine gather some nuts and bring them to him.
The father puts his child on his back and, with the nails the boy brings, he beats him to remember.
And as he feels the sting of the blows, little Brancozzi has the revelation that the world can be seen from another perspective and that things around it can appear upside down.
Especially the position of the sun, different from the well-known, makes him wonder, as he would recognize in old age, if not the astral body itself participates in his disturbance.
Had the sun been as troubled as his father by what had happened to him?
At the present time, the city is not functioning
A congressman appeals to politicians to remember those who voted for him.
Independent MP Viorel Blăjuț called on PSD and PNL to stop the internal fights and reorient their agenda towards the electorate.
What we're seeing now on our political scene is a big split and that's it.
I haven't seen anything from the USL projects since 2012 that's continued.
Not the highway, not the Regional Emergency Hospital, you just see politicians arguing about possible locations based on real estate interests.
Let's put politics aside for a while, get together and talk.
At the present time, the city is not functioning.
"If you're busy with the internal war, you don't have time for those who elected you", said Blunt.
He said that the current political class had disappointed the Isonian electorate, with the result that the turnout in the upcoming local elections would be very low, around 30%, representing the party's loyal electorate.
The MEPs also believe that voters will also be oriented towards traditional parties, expressing reservations about new political initiatives, such as the "For Iași" party that will be launched today.
Local parties have very little chance and will only tear from the right-wing electorate, not from the PSD.
Such parties rely on civic activists, who are usually right-wing.
"The right is fragmenting even more, which is not good for anyone, not even for the PSD", said Blajuć.
He stated that he is not interested in running in the upcoming local elections, denying rumors about his intention to run for Mayor.
I also said I don't want to run for any local office.
I'm still considering whether to continue as an MP in the next term.
I tried to appeal for unity for Iasi and in the discussions in the halls, with the other parliamentarians, and I was accused of wanting to make my image.
I don't want to, but we can't go on like this.
"If people voted for us, it doesn't mean they're stupid to vote for us if they don't see anything", said Blajuć, who said the main reason why the electorate is no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of the elected officials.
A colleague from Tatarash said that he didn't have enough money and had to take the bus.
Let's not be hypocritical.
It's not a small amount.
Sometimes I'm ashamed to pick up money from the cashier.
At the end of my term, I'm going to report everything I've spent, except the salaries of the cabinet and the maintenance of it.
I happened to raise in one month and 30,000 lei, with all the transportation, accommodation and other discounts.
"To say that a parliamentarian does not have enough money is pure hypocrisy", concluded Blajuc.
