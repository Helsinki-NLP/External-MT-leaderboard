The rapidly growing rate of cumulative coronavirus infection (COVID-19) in the European Union and the UK between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has similar trends in the European Union/European Economic Zone countries and in the UK, thus confirming that despite the different stages of its development in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly growing in all countries.
Given the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive therapy departments need to increase the level of readiness to the flow of patients with COVID-19, who will need treatment and, in particular, intensive therapy.
On December 31, 2019, a number of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were recorded in Uhan, the Chinese province of Hubei.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention that the cause of the infection is a new type of coronavirus, now known as the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has become known as coronavirus infection (COVID-19).
According to available data, approximately 80% of people with COVID-19 the disease occurs in a mild form, i.e. in the form of respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, with most patients healing.
In approximately 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops into a more severe form of disease with the need to be hospitalized, and in the remaining 6% it takes a critical form when intensive therapy is required.
The mortality rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
This study analyses the cumulative prevalence trends of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union (EU) / European Economic Zone (EEA) and in the UK and compares them to the trends in the Chinese province of Hubei.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK with data for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK
After the explosion in China, COVID-19 spread to other countries, and now in the rest of the world, the COVID-19 pandemic is developing according to the same dynamics as in China.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a COVID-19 pandemic.
In the Eurosurveillance magazine of March 5, 2020, Mr. Spiter (Spiteri) and his colleagues the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe, which fulfilled the criteria by which the WHO determines the presence of the disease.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were registered in France on 24 January 2020 – all three sick returned from the city of Uhan, in the Chinese province of Hubei.
As of March 15, 2020, cases of COVID-19 infection have been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and in the UK, with 39 768 cases of infection and 1 727 deaths recorded for the period from December 31, 2019 to that date, of which 17 750 cases, including 1 441 with a fatal result, are per one only Italy.
Determination of cumulative quantity and cumulative incidence COVID-19
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) daily at 8:00 am updates data on the number of registered COVID-19 cases in each country of the world, obtained from official sources such as the ministries of health of these countries, national and regional health governments and the WHO.
These data are used to analyze the COVID-19 spread trends in the EU/EEA and in the UK and to compare them with data in Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, the cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 was calculated for 14 days, taking into account the normal COVID-19 flow in each EU/EEA country and in the UK for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of cases recorded in each country at 8:00 15 March 2020, compared to the data for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 development trends in the EU/EEA and the UK
The trends of COVID-19 cumulative occurrence over the 14-day period in the EU/EEA countries and in the UK as a whole matched the trends observed in the Chinese Hubei province (fig. 1).
The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the UK as a whole began to grow approximately on February 21, and on February 28, 2020 there was a sharp jump of this indicator (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid growth of the number of registered cases of the disease in Italy, but also in all other EU/EEA countries and in the UK, similar trends to the growth of the cumulative incidence of the disease COVID-19 (additional material) were observed.
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and in the UK compared to the similar indicator for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
According to these data, the total number of cases already registered at 8:00 15 March in 15 other EU/EEA countries and in the UK, comparable to the number recorded in Italy just about 3 weeks earlier.
Our results show a rapid increase in the number of COVID-19 cases registered in the EU/EEA and in the UK.
The observed trends of the cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 allow us to assume that the pandemic develops at a comparable rate in all countries.
And this despite the different stages in different countries, the differences in response measures taken by the national public health authorities, and possibly different criteria for the recognition of cases of the disease and different rules for the selection of patients for the analysis of the presence of COVID-19, including the “make-up” testing.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy that approximately 10% of patients with COVID-19 needed intensive therapy, and the media noted that hospitals and intensive therapy departments in these regions were already fully filled.
Currently, data on hospitalization of COVID-19 patients and/or intensive therapy departments in the EU/EEA are only available for 6% and 1% of cases respectively (the data is not presented).
However, it is necessary to conduct a systematic collection of such data to supplement the current observation data, the subject of which is the number of registered cases and the number of deaths.
According to the results of the 2010–2011 study, there is a significant decrease in the number of cakes in the intensive therapy and patient care departments in Europe: from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 cakes per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12,5 beds in intensive therapy departments and intensive care departments per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010-2011).
The sixth updated report of the ECDC on the results of the COVID-19 Express Risk Assessment is presented in the healthcare system resource load simulation scenarios with COVID-19 infected hospitalization estimates in each EU/EEA country and in the UK, where the risk of lack of available cakes in intensive therapy departments exceeds 90%.
Since cases are currently grouped by specific regions of the EU/EEA and the UK, and hospitals and intensive therapy departments usually serve the population of a specific territorial group, information on cases of infection and the number of cows in intensive therapy departments is recommended to be provided by units of Level 2 NUTS-2 for statistical purposes.
Italy’s experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is developing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive therapy departments should be prepared for the scenario of SARS-CoV-2 contact infection, which is not weakening for a long time, and for the increase in the number of COVID-19 patients in need of medical care and, in particular, intensive therapy, which, for example, can be observed in the affected regions of Italy.
According to the ECDC’s latest report on the results of the express risk assessment, a rapid, preventive and comprehensive approach is of great importance for the disruption of SARS-COV-2 with a subsequent transition from the disruption to the minimization of the consequences, since, given the predicted rapid growth in the number of diseases, decision-makers and hospitals may simply not have enough time to consider, take and properly adjust their response measures unless such measures are taken in advance.
The report on the results of the express risk assessment also listed public health measures aimed at mitigating the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have only a short period of time during which they can intensify their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the burden on their health systems.
If this is not done, the healthcare system in other EU/EEA countries will face a flows of patients who will need intensive therapy in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus infection (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a tragedy for mankind: at the moment, more than 3,000 people have died in China and other countries, and the number of infected has exceeded 80,000.
Like the homological SARS-CoV virus, which caused the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from flying mice and cause similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 is characterized by a lower severity of the disease and a lower mortality than SARS, but it is much more infectious and affects older people more often than young people, and men more often than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on the new disease, this article offers an up-to-date and comprehensive review of the rapidly developing subject of the study.
We will consider the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis of the future course and prevention of this disease.
Although the answers to many questions are still to be found, we hope that this review will help understand and eradicate the dangerous disease.
The spring celebration (Chinese New Year), which falls on January 25, 2020, has become an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all Chinese people who, due to the outbreak of a new viral infection, were strongly urged to stay at home throughout the holiday and for many weeks after it.
Given the high degree of coronavirus (CoV) similarity that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020 named this virus SARS-CoV-2, and the accompanying disease was coronavirus infection 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Uhan and rapidly spread throughout the country, and then almost 50 other countries in the world.
According to data on 2 March 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, more than 40,000 patients recovered, more than 3,000 patients died.
The WHO warns that COVID-19 is “the number one enemy for society” and potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months more than 200 publications on COVID-19, including articles on its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, began with the first report of January 7, 2020, in which the sequence of the virus separated from a whole number of patients was determined.
This review is an attempt to summarize the results of research in a new and rapidly developing subject area.
As far as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coronavirus disease - the coronavirus of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), whose outbreak occurred in 2012.
We will also discuss known at the moment facts about the prevention and forecast of the course of the disease, as well as some other not less urgent issues.
Coronavirus has traditionally been the number of pathogens that are not fatal to humans and mostly cause about 15% of the total respiratory diseases.
Nevertheless, in this century we have twice encountered highly pathogenic human coronavirus, i.e. the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and the coronavirus of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), which caused the outbreak of diseases originally in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012 respectively and soon spread to many other countries with a terrible level of severity of the disease and mortality.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of coronavirus infection in human history.
As shown on Figure 1.1, the report on the clusters of cases of pneumonia of unknown origin was first received to the National Health Commission of China from Uhan on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, a genetic sequence of the virus was released.
On 15 January 2020, the first death case was recorded in Uhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic rapidly spread to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20th, it became known about the infection of medical workers, which allowed to assume the possibility of the transmission of the virus from a person to a person.
On January 23 in Uhan was introduced a quarantine, cessed the work of the city public transport.
On January 24, according to the first clinical study of this disease, it was noted that 21 out of 41 patients with confirmed coronavirus infection had direct contacts with the seafood market in Uhan, which was considered the starting point of the spread of the infection from an unknown animal.
On January 30, the WHO announced that the coronavirus explosion is a global public health emergency.
At the time of the preparation of this report, the disease spread throughout China and has already penetrated approximately 50 other countries around the world (cf. (cf. 2).
Given the rapid development of the situation, the final scale and degree of risk of the explosion is still to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-centric clinical study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients with confirmed COVID-19, presented the following updated picture of the epidemic development (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 was exposed to all age groups, but mostly people aged 30 to 65 years old.
Nearly half (47.7%) of the infected were over the age of 50, very few were under the age of 20, and only 14 infected were not 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infection among men is higher (0,31/100 000) than among women (0,27/100 000).
COVID-19 was spread by clusters mainly in the province of Hubei and nearby regions.
On average, from the moment of the manifestation of the symptoms of COVID-19 until the diagnosis took 5 (2–9) days.
The incubation period was an average of 4.8 (3.0–7.2) days.
From the moment of manifestation of symptoms to the beginning of death, the average time lasted 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproduction index (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51–4.05), and the corrected R0 was 2.23–4.82.
By January 23, 2020 there was an exponential increase in the number of infected, coinciding in time with large-scale transportation in advance of the celebration of Chinese New Year.
The mortality rate among patients with confirmed diagnosis was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10–1.86%) and the corrected mortality rate among patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02–4.59%).
Three main risk factors in case of COVID-19 infection were: gender (man), age (≥60) and severe cases of pneumonia.
Coronavirus is a subfamily of large membrane viruses containing one thread of meaningful RNA.
They can be divided into four species, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha and beta-coronavirus are known to affect humans.
In the case of SARS and MERS coronavirus injury, the glycoprotein (S) is linked to the cell receptors of the type 2 angiotensin-reversing enzyme (ACE2) and Dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP4) respectively, after which the membrane synthesis occurs.
In cytoplasma, the genome of the viral RNA is released; after the replication of the viral genome, the genome of the RNA together with the membrane glycoproteins and nucleocapside proteins generates virion-containing vesicles, which then fusion with the cell membrane, releasing the virus.
The first reports on the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 appeared on January 10, 2020.
It is found that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-coronavirus, the gene of which 99.98% coincides with 10 consecutive samples collected in the first center of the disease, on the Huanang seafood market in Uhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
With the help of an illuminating electronic microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in the ultra-thin cracks of the human respiratory epithelium.
It has been found that human enzyme ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as for SARS-CoV.
However, the S-protein SARS-CoV-2 is linked to the human ACE2 enzyme weaker than in the case of SARS-CoV, which explains the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a disease of less severity in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also generate previously unknown short-living protein, orf3b encoded, and secreted protein, orf8 encoded.
The orf3b protein of SARS-CoV-2 virus can play some role in terms of the pathogenity of the virus and suppress the IFNβ expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motivation.
On February 18, 2020, a group of authors led by Zhou (Zhou) presented reports on the cryoelectronic tomography of the full-dimensional structure of the human ACE2 enzyme with a resolution of 2.9 Å in combination with the B0AT1 amino acid carrier.
They found that this complex, which included open and closed formations, was collected as a dymmer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could link two S-protein, which serves as proof for the detection of the coronavirus and infection.
B0AT1 can become a therapeutic target when performing medication screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate owner
It is known that the source of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were flying mice, from which the virus was transmitted to humans through the tubes and worms respectively.
Through a philogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronavirus, it was found that the first owners of SARS-CoV-2 were flying mice, as the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like coronavirus, namely SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.
However, it remains unknown which species became the intermediate owner, thanks to which the virus managed to overcome the species barrier and infect a person; the way of transmission is also still to be discovered.
Mr. Ji (Ji) and his colleagues suggested that the virus was transmitted from flying mice to humans by dragons, during which a homological recombination in S-protein occurred.
According to the results of their study, Chinese scientists from Guangzhou have assumed that pinguins — long-lasting mammals that are fed by myrtles and often used in traditional Chinese medicine — are potential intermediate owners of SARS-CoV-2; this assumption is based on a 99 percent genetic similarity between the coronavirus of pinguins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference distributed between the two genoms is still very large, so it is believed that the final results with specific evidence have not yet been obtained (cf.
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown.
In laboratory conditions, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 °C and 40% to 50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It is known that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet and heating to 56 °C for 30 minutes; effectively block the activity of the virus can ether, 75 percent ethyl alcohol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, peroxic acid, chlorophorms and other fat-containing solvents, but not chlorhexidine.
The human population in general has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2, so people are susceptible to the new virus.
There are currently no data on detailed studies of the immune reaction to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only refer to earlier studies of other coronavirus, primarily SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (see (see 4).
As a rule, the host virus first recognizes the inherited immune system through image-recognition receptors (ORRs), including C-type lexine receptors, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors and RIG-I-like receptors.
Through various mechanisms, the virus provokes the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturity of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons, which inhibit the spread of the virus and accelerate the fagocytosis of macrophages against viral antigen.
However, thanks to N-protein, SARS-CoV can avoid an immune reaction.
In short, an adaptive immune reaction is included in the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including T cells CD4+ and CD8+, play an important role in protecting the body.
CD4+ T cells stimulate the production of viral-specific antibodies in B cells, and CD8+ T cells directly kill the virus-affected cells.
T-helpers produce anti-inflammatory cytokines that help the protective cells.
However, the coronavirus can inhibit the function of T cells, causing their programmed death.
Humoral immunity, which includes components such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies, also plays an important role in fighting viral infection.
For example, the antibodies separated from the healed patient were neutralized by MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the hyperreaction of the immune system leads to the local formation of a large number of free radicals, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst scenario leads to polyorgan insufficiency and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by a cluster manifestation, is more likely to affect elderly people with accompanying pathologies and pregnant women.
The likelihood of infection is higher for those people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or have disorders of the immune system.
According to the results of the study of data on the first 425 cases of infection in Uhan, the estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is from 1 to 14 days, mostly 3 to 7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period lasted an average of 3 days, with a breakdown of 0 to 24 days.
The study, based on the demographic data of 8 866 cases, found that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0–7.2) days.
It is very important for healthcare bodies to adjust the timing of the introduced quarantine measures taking into account the most accurate calculations of the duration of the incubation period, which will prevent the spread of the virus to those infected with the disease being unsymptomatic.
A common practice was a 14-day quarantine for people who have been in contact with the virus or infected with the virus.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
The main and first symptom of COVID-19 is often high temperature, which can be the only manifestation or accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, difficulty breathing, muscle pain, headache, headache, throat pain, colds, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
In some patients, a week after the start of the disease, a depression and (or) hypoxia was observed.
In severe cases, the disease progressed rapidly, and patients developed acute respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with high temperatures and (or) symptoms of respiratory disease and acute fever should be checked for the virus in order to make a early diagnosis even in the absence of pathologies on breast images.
A demographic study, conducted at the end of December 2019, identified the following indicators of the prevalence of symptoms: 98% - high temperature, 76% - dry cough, 55% - breathing and 3% - diarrhea; 8% of patients needed artificial lung ventilation.
Similar results were obtained as a result of two recent studies of cases of infection in the family and the transmission of the virus from non-symptomatic infected.
Comparative results were obtained in 2012 in a study of MERS-CoV patients with high temperatures (98%), dry cough (47%) and depression (55%) as well.
However, 80% of them required artificial lungs ventilation, this figure is much higher than among patients with COVID-19, and it corresponds to a higher MERS mortality rate than from COVID-19.
Patients with MERS also had diarrhea (26%) and throat pain (21%).
The main symptoms of patients with SARS are high temperature (99-100%), dry cough (29–75%), depression (40–42%), diarrhea (20–25%) and throat pain (13–25%), and artificial lung ventilation is required by 14–20% of patients.
On February 14, the mortality rate for COVID-19 was 2%, and the total number of confirmed cases in the world reached 66,576.
Compared to this, the death rate from SARS by November 2002 was 10% of 8.096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, the demographic survey conducted in June 2012 showed a mortality rate of 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
According to the results of the earlier study, the basic reproduction index (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was determined at the level of 6.47 at a 95% trust interval (CI) between 5.71 and 7.23, while the R0 for SARS-CoV was in the interval only 2 to 4.
The SARS-CoV-2 comparison with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV for symptoms, mortality and R0 is shown in Table 1.1.
The above indicators indicate a higher prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 compared to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the mortality rate in case of new virus infection is lower compared to the latter two.
Thus, it will be much harder to stop the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemic.
Cluster manifestation often occurs when infected within one family or group of people gathered together for any reason or found together on any transportation, for example on a cruise line.
Patients frequently traveled to Uhan or other affected regions, lived there or contacted the infected or affected during the last two weeks before the disease began.
However, according to the data presented in the reports, people may be the carrier of the virus without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and healed patients, after being removed from the hospital, may again become the carrier of the virus, and this is an alarming signal to extend the duration of the quarantine.
In the early stages, patients have a normal or reduced number of leukocytes (especially lymphocytes) in the peripheral blood.
For example, 1,099 patients with COVID-19 were diagnosed with lymphopenia with leukocytes < 4×109/L, including leukocytes < 1×109/L, as well as increased asparagine-aminotransferase and virsemia.
In the blood of some patients, increased levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin were detected, and in most patients, increased levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocytes in the blood were detected.
In patients with severe course of the disease, the level of D-dimer, the product of the breakdown of the fiber present in the blood, was increased, and the number of lymphocytes was constantly reduced.
Most patients with COVID-19 in the X-ray examination of the chest cells were diagnosed with pathologies characterized by uneven shadows on both sides or shadows of the type of "moth glass" in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lungs damage and acute respiratory disease (ORS).
With the development of ARS, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis lead to a substantial disruption of gas exchange.
The dysfunction of pneumocytes of types I and II reduces the level of surface-active compounds and increases surface voltage, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and increasing the risk of lung fall.
Thus, the worst results of X-ray examination often coincide with the most severe cases of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated pneumocytes, the formation of hyalin membranes and intercanal lymphocytal infiltration, and multi-core syncital cells in lung patients dying from the disease correspond to the pathologies of viral infection and SARS and similar to those found in patients with SARS and MERS.
As the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19, the SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection method was used through a polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcriptase (PCR with reverse transcriptase).
However, given the high level of false-negative results that could accelerate the pace of epidemic development, from February 13, 2020 in China began diagnosing on the basis of clinical manifestations (no longer relying exclusively on PCR with reverse transcriptase).
The situation was similar with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, for effective diagnosis, it is critical and necessary to combine the data of the history of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and the results of the X-ray examination.
On February 14, 2020, a group of experts under the leadership of Mr. Feng Zhang described the application protocol of the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK method for detection of SARS-CoV-2; this method allows to detect synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at a density of 20 × 10–18 mol/l to 200 × 10–18 mol/l (10–100 copies per microlite of the source sample) using indicators in less than an hour without the use of complex equipment.
This new method, if it is successfully tested on clinical drugs, can significantly increase the sensitivity of tests and the convenience of their conduct.
Due to the lack of experience of counteracting the previously unknown coronavirus, doctors can mainly provide patients with COVID-19 only supporting therapy, while trying to apply any therapeutic methods that were used or proposed in the treatment of other coronavirus such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapeutic methods include current or potential use of antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma recovered patients, traditional Chinese medicine and providing psychological support.
It was recommended to use even the plasma of healed patients for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are rushing to develop antibodies and vaccines to fight the virus.
In the early stages, SARS-CoV-2 attacks mainly the lungs, and may also be less affected by other organs expressing ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidney.
However, the failure to work and the refusal of the respiratory organs are the main threat and the cause of death of patients.
Thus, to relieve the symptoms and save lives, it is critical to support the respiratory function, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen supply, non-invasive artificial ventilation and invasive mechanical lung ventilation, which are prescribed depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extra-corporal membrane oxidation (ECMO), a modified method of extra-pulmonal circulation used for the treatment of life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, it is important for patients with SARS-CoV-2 to maintain water and salt balance, to prevent and treat secondary infections and septic shock, as well as to protect vital organs’ functions.
It is known that the cytokin storm is a consequence of hyperreaction of the immune system of patients infected with SARS and MERS viruses.
The cytokine storm is a form of a systemic inflammatory process that develops in response to the secretion of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines provoke the immunocytes to release a huge amount of free radicals, which are the main cause of ARS and polyorganic insufficiency.
In the treatment of a cytokine storm, especially in patients in a severe condition, the suppression of immunity is important.
For the treatment of the cytokine storm, corticosteroids and tocylisumab were used, monoclonal antibodies serving as an inhibitor of interleukin-6.
Other methods of treatment of the cytokine storm, based on immunity suppression, include the modulation of the immune reaction aimed at controlling T cells; the blockade of the production of cytokines IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; the suppression of yuns-kinase; the use of blnatumomaba, cytokine signals 4 suppressors and histodecethalase inhibitors.
To reduce the severity of the consequences of inflammatory processes in the treatment of SARS viruses, steroids are widely used as immunity suppressors.
However, large doses of steroids do not benefit in the treatment of severe lungs in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, which significantly deteriorate the prognosis.
However, short corticosteroid courses in small and medium doses are recommended to be used with caution when treating patients with COVID-19 in critical condition.
At the time of preparation of this document there is no confirmed effective antiviral therapy.
However, the intravenous administration of remdecivir, a nucleotide analogue, proved to be an effective treatment for an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a newly developed antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg virus.
Later, the remdecivir also demonstrated the possibility of suppression of other viruses with a monocellular RNA, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these data, Gilead has delivered this medication to China for a pair of studies on patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results of these studies are awaiting.
Additionally, as possible treatment options for patients with acute respiratory symptoms, baricitinib, α-interferon, lobinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin were proposed.
Combined treatment with the use of Lopinavir/Ritonavir may be accompanied by diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other side effects.
The interaction of these medications with other medications prescribed to patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of healed patients and the production of antibodies
The blood test in patients healed from a infectious disease has been used for the treatment of other patients suffering from the same disease, or to protect a healthy population for a long time.
And in fact, the blood of recovered patients often contains a relatively high amount of antibodies to fight the pathogen.
The antibodies are in immunoglobulin produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other alien objects; they recognize individual molecules of pathogens and addressally neutralize them.
Based on this assumption, plasma was separated from blood samples of the group of patients healed from COVID-19, which was then administered to 10 seriously ill patients.
Within 24 hours, their symptoms improved, the severity of inflammation and viral load decreased, as well as increased blood saturation with oxygen.
However, to propose massive use of this method before specific therapy is required not yet conducted examination and not prepared explanations.
In addition, taking into account the therapeutic effect, some disadvantages associated with the use of plasma should be carefully studied.
For example, antibodies can excessively stimulate the immune system and cause cytokine emission syndrome, which, given its toxicity, is a potential life threat.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and plasma for the treatment of patients in critical condition requires a lot.
It’s easy to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to overcome a global epidemic.
Thus, it is more important and practical to distinguish the B-cells of healed patients and to identify the genetic code of effective antibodies or to perform screening to find effective antibodies against critical viral proteins.
So we can immediately move to mass production of antibodies.
For thousands of years, Chinese people have used traditional medicine to treat various diseases.
However, its effectiveness depends largely on the combination of a variety of components of the formula, the composition of which differs depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on the theories of Chinese traditional medicine.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or have an uncertain effect, as identifying and verifying these components or their optimal combination seems difficult.
Currently, due to the absence of effective specific therapy COVID-19 Chinese traditional medicine has become one of the main alternative methods of treatment for patients with light and medium severity of symptoms or for patients recovering after a severe stage of the disease.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been recognised as effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest percentage of recovered patients with COVID-19 was in a number of provinces in China where traditional Chinese medicine was used to treat 87 percent of patients, including in Gansu (63.7 percent), Ninja (50 percent) and Hunan (50 percent), while in the province of Hubei, where traditional Chinese medicine was used to treat only approximately 30 percent of COVID-19 patients, the lowest percentage of recovered patients was (13 percent).
However, this is a fairly brutal comparison, as the assessment should be carried out taking into account a number of other influence factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of their disease.
On February 18, 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang and his colleagues published the research material in which a comparison of treatment was carried out exclusively on the methods of Western medicine and combined treatment on the methods of Western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine.
They found that the periods for the normalization of body temperature, the elimination of symptoms and the provision of medical care in the condition of the hospital were significantly lower in patients for whose treatment was used a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine methods than in patients who were treated only by Western methods.
The most surprising is that the percentage of patients who began to deteriorate symptoms (from light to severe) was significantly lower in the group treated by a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine methods than in the group treated only by Western methods (7.4% compared to 46.2%), and the mortality rate in the first group was lower than in the second (8.8% compared to 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of traditional Chinese medicine still requires more thoroughly controlled studies conducted in greater scale and in greater numbers of regions.
A certain interest is also to obtain, if possible, a description of the mechanism of action and an explanation of the aspects of the effectiveness of the components used in the methods of Chinese traditional medicine, or their combination.
Patients who suspect or have confirmed the presence of COVID-19, mostly experience a strong fear of acute and even fatal disease, and people closed for quarantine also experience fatigue, loneliness and extreme irritation.
In addition, such infectious symptoms such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as side effects of treatment, such as insomnia from corticosteroids, can cause even greater anxiety and psychological stress.
In the early stages of the outbreak of the disease caused by the SARS virus, manifestations of a number of psychiatric diseases, including chronic depression, increased anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, delirium and even suicidal behavior were.
Compulsory contact and quarantine tracking, which is one of the measures taken by health care authorities to prevent the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase people’s anxiety and guilt feeling related to the spread of the infection, quarantine and social clay in their families and friends.
In this context, psychological and psychiatric assistance should be provided to patients with COVID-19, to suspects and contacts with them, as well as to all other people to whom it is needed.
In the framework of psychological support, multiple psychiatric brigades should be formed, clear information should be provided with regular and accurate updates of information about the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and professional electronic devices and applications should be used to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role in breaking the transmission chain from infected animals and infected people to sensitive owners and are often used in addition to antiviral therapy used to suppress epidemics caused by new viruses.
The work was carried out on the creation of S-protein-based vaccines, the purpose of which is to produce long-lived and highly active neutralizing antibodies and (or) protective immunity to SARS-CoV.
During the studies on animals, lively weakened SARS vaccines were developed.
However, before the start of clinical trials, it is still necessary to determine the effectiveness of these possible vaccines in natural conditions when they are used in older patients, the mortal dose infection model and the degree of protection against zoonic viruses infection.
Per the reason is that the SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago, and since then no new case has been.
At the same time, sporadic cases and clusters of MERS disease continue to appear, originating in the Middle East and spreading to other regions thanks to the preservation of zoonic sources in endemic habitat areas.
For the fight against MERS, vaccination strategies were developed using an inactivated virus, DNA plasmide, viral vectors, nanoparticles, viral-like particles and components of recombinant proteins, and some of these strategies were evaluated on animals.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immunity persons is an urgent and critical task that requires a solution to preventing the burning epidemic.
However, there are serious difficulties due to the long-term (an average of 18 months) necessary for the development of the vaccine, and the dynamic variation of coronavirus.
As a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 just begins to show a full picture of the clinical course of the disease by thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can gradually recover without complications.
However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also associated with high frequency of complications and high mortality among patients with severe course of the disease.
In this context, it is critical for healthcare bodies to make a prognostic pattern of the disease to determine the priority of the measures they take, especially in areas where resources are lacking.
Based on the data of current clinical trials, the following factors may affect or be related to the prognosis of the course of the disease in patients with COVID-19 (Table (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in predicting the course of the disease caused by the SARS virus, which is also true in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects patients aged 30 to 65, 47.7% of whom are over 50 years old, according to the above study, 8 866 cases.
Patients who needed intensive therapy were more likely to have initial diseases and complications, and they were significantly older than those patients who did not require such therapy (an average of 66 years against 51 years), which indicates that age is a prognostic factor for patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infection among men is higher than among women (0,31/100 000 against 0,27/100 000), as mentioned above.
Disease and complications: Patients with COVID-19, who require intensive therapy, are more likely to develop acute myocardial damage and arithmia.
Cardiological phenomena were also the main cause of death of patients with SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 has also been to be linked to ACE2 positive cholangiocytes, which may cause a liver failure in patients with COVID-19.
It is worth noting that age and initial diseases are closely connected and can distort the results.
Abnormalities identified in laboratory studies: the level of C-reactive protein in the blood reflects the severity of the inflammatory process or tissue damage, and it is suggested to be considered as a potential prognostic factor of the course of the disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
It was also proposed to take into account the relationship between the level of C-reactive protein, the severity of the disease and the forecast for COVID-19.
In addition, the result can also be predicted by an increased level of lactatehydrogenase, asparagine-aminotransferase, alanine-aminotransferase and creatinkinase.
These enzymes in large amounts are secreted by various organs, especially by the heart and liver, and their release occurs when the tissue is damaged.
Therefore, they are traditionally markers of heart or liver dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: to predict the results and complications of COVID-19 treatment along with other factors should be taken into account the data of the X-ray examination of the chest and the development of clinical symptoms over time.
Using steroids: as described above, steroids are immunity inhibitors, widely used in infectious diseases as an additional therapy to reduce the severity of the inflammatory process.
Since corticosteroids were widely used for the treatment of patients with severe forms of SARS, many of the survivors of the disease developed avascular osteonecrosis, which was the cause of lifelong disability and low quality of life.
Thus, if it is necessary to use steroids for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 these drugs should be prescribed in small doses and short courses.
Psychological stress: As described above, in the background of the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from unexpected strong stress, as they often have to bear long periods of quarantine, cope with a high degree of uncertainty and observe the deaths of their relatives and other patients.
To alleviate stress in such patients and help them return to normal life, they must necessarily be psychologically consulted and have long-term support.
According to the demographic studies conducted at the moment, the COVID-19 epidemic is apparently different from the SARS epidemic.
In addition to replications in the lower respiratory tract, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, like other coronavirus that cause common colds, can successfully multiply in the upper respiratory tract and cause weak symptoms or do not cause symptoms at all in the early stages of infection.
For this reason, those patients who have the early stage of the disease or have not yet completed the incubation period can, by living their usual life, spread the virus in a significant scale, which makes it significantly difficult for epidemiological control.
However, it was believed that the transmission of the SARS-CoV virus occurs when patients are seriously ill, with the fact that in most cases in the early stages of infection it did not occur.
Thus, today’s COVID-19 epidemic is much more serious than the SARS epidemic, and it is harder to control.
Currently, a large work is being carried out in China, in the framework of which the general quarantine has been announced in Uhan and neighboring cities, as well as the quarantine has been extended for almost all the population, introduced to break the SARS-CoV-2 spread chain.
Though these measures cause tremendous damage to the economy and other areas of life of the country, the number of new patients detected is decreasing, which indicates a slowing rate of spread of the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic estimates, the outbreak of the disease will end in March, and the stagnation phase will last 3-4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hunter and his colleagues estimated that the COVID-19, which seems much more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Researchers from the group led by Ira Longini (Ira Longini) developed a model to predict the end of the epidemic and assumed that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could affect two-thirds of the world’s population.
A group of Canadian experts that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was detected in nose and throat masks taken in patients healed and removed from hospitals two weeks earlier, indicating that the new virus could become a cyclic disease similar to the flu.
However, the decrease in the number of new cases in China is encouraging, indicating that the current strategies may have taken effect.
According to initial forecasts, Ebola fever was expected to affect up to a million people and cause the deaths of half a million patients.
But due to strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was eventually able to get under control.
It is likely that, like the SARS-CoV virus, the infectious capacity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus may decrease, and over time it will disappear or become a less pathogenic virus that exists with a person.
Below is a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemic (cf.
SARS-CoV-2 virus is characterized by a high rate of transmission through cough or chewing, as well as possibly through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also detected in the pot, which means that the oral and fecal method of transmission is also possible.
According to one of the latest studies, 41% of the 138 cases were likely to have been a result of infection at the hospital, including 17 patients with other previously identified diseases and 40 medical staff.
Therefore, serious precautions should be taken to protect the population, especially health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues and even strangers, contacting with patients or infected.
The first line of defense in the fight for reducing the risk of infection is the wear of facial masks; both surgical masks, and respiratory classes N95 (Series No. 1860s) help to control the spread of viruses.
Surgery masks do not allow micro drops of fluid from potentially infected to fly in the air and sit on the surfaces from which they can be transmitted to the surrounding.
However, only N95 (Series No. 1860s) masks can protect against the inhalation of virions of 10 to 80 nm, they pass only 5% of virions; SARS-CoV-2 is the same size as SARS-CoV, and they both are approximately 85 nm.
Since the particles can penetrate even through five combined surgical masks, medical workers directly contacting patients must necessarily wear N95 class (series No. 1860s) masks rather than surgical masks.
In addition to the masks, medical workers should wear a shaped shirt to further reduce the possibility of contact with viruses.
Viruses can also enter the body through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, the doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite the fact that he was wearing a N95 class mask; the virus came into his body through the inflammated eyes.
Therefore, medical workers should also wear transparent face bricks or closed-type protective glasses.
All inhabitants in the affected or potentially threatened regions are strongly advised to wash their hands more often than usual with disinfecting washers, try not to leave the house, observing self-isolation, and limit contact with potentially infected people.
The acceptable distance to the patient is a distance of about a meter.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Despite the fact that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was not previously known to mankind, the high degree of its similarity to the SARS-CoV, which was on 7 January 2020, was supposed to be a alarming signal for China, taking into account the experience it acquired during the SARS explosion in 2003.
However, only after January 19, 2020, the director of the Center for Disease Control in Uhan calmed citizens, that the new virus has low contamination and limited reproductive capacity when transmitted from person to person and that preventing the spread and control of the disease will not be a problem.
This statement significantly reduced social tensions, especially in the period when the whole country was preparing for the celebration of the Chinese New Year, and a critically important time was missed when the disease could be stopped within the limits of the city of Wuhan with minimal losses.
Chinese health authorities can learn this hard lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, health authorities should: (1) make more cautious public statements, since each word is taken into account by citizens and can affect their attitude and decisions; (2) more carefully monitor and respond to unusual information coming from the clinic, rather than waiting for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take more determined measures to prevent a potential epidemic in the early stages of its development, rather than calm the public; and (4) more often conduct targeted and effective exercises to increase the level of awareness of the population about epidemic diseases and to regularly check and improve the response system of society.
The COVID-19 explosion, caused by a previously unstudied coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome of type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease covered the whole of China and at the time of the document was drawn up to 50 countries around the world.
Since the virus is very similar to the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to the symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), with the COVID-19 explosion there was a feeling of SARS recurrence.
However, between COVID-19 and SARS there are some significant differences, significant in terms of epidemic repression and patient treatment.
COVID-19 affects elderly people more than youth, and men more than women; the proportion of severe cases and mortality among elderly people is also higher than among youth.
The death rate due to SARS is higher than in COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 spread the virus even with the unsymptomatic course of the disease, while patients with SARS usually infect others only in severe cases of the disease, so it is more difficult to stop the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and larger than SARS-CoV.
Some patients with COVID-19 may have negative normal samples of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
On the other hand, healed patients can again show positive samples of the virus.
All this significantly increases the risk of the spread of the virus.
On the background of this rapid advancement of COVID-19 research, some important issues remain unresolved, namely:
What is the origin of SARS-CoV-2 virus?
Despite the 96-percent homologist’s discovery between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like coronavirus of flying mice, we still cannot claim that the SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred from flying mice.
What animal became the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original owner, for example from flying mice, to man?
Without knowing the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot reliably interrupt the path of transmission, and the epidemiological situation can worsen at any time.
Molecular modeling and biochemical samples have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is connected to ACE2, but how is the virus introduced into the respiratory cells and causes subsequent pathological changes?
Is the virus also linked to the ACE2 cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot provide a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How is the virus genetically evolving in the process of transmission from person to person?
Will it be the cause of a world pandemic, will it disappear as SARS or will it periodically repeat like a flu?
These aspects are of primary importance, but it will take time to find answers to these and many other questions.
However, we have no other choice than, whatever it costs, to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normal life.
Zoo origin of human coronavirus
Mutation and adaptation have stimulated the co-evolution of coronavirus (CoVs) and their carriers, including humans, for thousands of years.
Until 2003, it was known that two human coronavirus (HCoV) cause a mild disease, such as a normal cold.
The eruptions of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed our idea of how catastrophic and life-threatening human coronavirus infection can be.
The appearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome of type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus in central China at the end of 2019 again attracted attention to coronavirus and surprised us by the high transmission, but less expressed pathogenicity of this virus compared to the related SARS-CoV virus.
Human coronavirus infection is a zoonosis, and understanding its zoonosis origin will be very useful.
Most human coronavirus originate from flying mice, for which they are not pathogenic.
Intermediate tanks are also known for the carriers of some human coronavirus.
The definition of carrier animals directly affects the prevention of the spread of human diseases.
Studying the interaction of animals that are the carriers of coronavirus can also light the pathogenesis of coronavirus in humans.
In this review we list the available data on seven human coronavirus, focusing on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonological origin and methods of intersectal transmission.
It is important to note that we make a comparison and comparison of different human coronavirus in terms of viral evolution and genetic recombination.
In this context, the current epidemic of the coronavirus caused in 2019 (COVID-19) is also considered.
In addition, the conditions required for a successful change of carriers are noted, and the influence of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the course of the disease.
Coronaviruses belong to the family of Coronaviridae, which is a group of membrane viruses with one positive-polar RNA thread.
These viruses with the largest genome among the RNA-containing viruses, containing 26 to 32 thousand nucleotides, were named because of their shape, which, when considered under an electronic microscope, resembles a crown.
From the point of view of structure, coronavirus contains unsegmented genoms with the same organism.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contain two large open part-covered reading frameworks (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are transmitted into polyprotein replica pp1a and pp1ab.
These polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 unstructured proteins named nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains open reading frameworks for structured proteins, including schipoprotein (S), membrane protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
In other lines of coronavirus, a number of line-specific accessory proteins are also encoded.
Based on differences in protein sequences, coronavirus is divided into four types (alpha, beta, gamma and delta coronavirus), while the type of beta coronavirus includes most human coronavirus and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
There are philogenetic evidence that the genetic source of most alpha and beta-coronavirus are flying mice and worms, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma and delta-coronavirus.
For thousands of years, coronavirus has constantly overcome intertype barriers, and some of them have evolved to dangerous pathogens for humans.
There are seven human coronavirus.
These include human alpha coronavirus HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63.
The remaining five beta-coronavirus include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), coronavirus of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 SARS-CoV-2.
Human coronavirus HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause light form symptoms such as cold and (or) diarrhea.
Unlike them, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the recently detected SARS-CoV-2 viruses are extremely pathogenic, causing severe infectious diseases of the lower respiratory tract in a relatively larger number of patients with a higher likelihood of developing acute respiratory disease (ORS) and outpatient symptoms.
The first thread of human coronavirus HCoV-229E, B814, was obtained from a sample separated from the nasal gland of patients suffering from a cold in the 1960s.
Since then, extensive research has gained more detailed knowledge about the HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 viruses that cause symptoms of local infection.
Indeed, before the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was a commonly accepted concept that human coronavirus infection was generally considered harmless.
SARS eruption in 2003 was one of the most disastrous epidemics in current history; more than 8,000 people suffered, and the total mortality rate was approximately 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) led to a prolonged epidemic on the Arab Peninsula, while the disease spread sporadically to the rest of the world.
Discovered in 2019, the new human coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which was subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the pathogen of the current coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, which on March 3, 2020 caused more than 3,120 deaths and the number of infected exceeded 91,000.
The alarm is received, and the world has to prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronavirus have zoonose origin, their sources are flying mice, mice or domestic animals.
Numerous sets of data indicate the evolutionary nature of the origin of all human coronavirus from flying mice, to whose organisms the viruses have been well adapted and in which they do not show pathogenic properties, but show broad genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has made China and the world a serious challenge from a medical, scientific, social and moral point of view.
The study of the zoonological mechanism of the origin of human coronavirus will enable you to understand their natural history, the drivers of their evolution and the factors that limit the intertype transmission.
It may also indicate or accelerate the search for the reservoir, the intermediate and amplifying SARS-CoV-2 carrier, which is very important to prevent the re- spread of the disease in the future.
This review contains general information about the zoonose origin, intertype transmission and pathogenesis of human coronavirus.
In particular, we point out and consider the following general feature: the original viruses from which human coronavirus occurred are usually not pathogenic for their tank carriers, but acquire a pathogenic character after intertype transmission to the new carriers.
We also analyze the trend of evolution of human coronavirus, according to which increased transmission is often accompanied by a weakening of pathogenic properties.
In the same context, the result of the current SARS-CoV-2 explosion is considered.
Animal coronavirus has been known since the late 1930s.
Before the HCoV-229E virus's B814 strain was first obtained from a sample separated from the nasal gland of cold patients, various coronavirus were found in different infected animals, including indes, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
In recent decades, seven human coronavirus have been detected.
Table 1 informatively and clearly presents a short history of the detection of human coronavirus in chronological order.
The first strain of the HCoV-229E virus was obtained from samples taken from the respiratory tract of patients with infection in the upper respiratory tract in 1966; later this virus adapted to reproduction in the lines of lung cells WI-38.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E showed cold symptoms, including headache, swelling, general discomfort and throat pain, with high temperature and cough observed in 10-20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCoV-OC43 virus was separated from the organic culture and subsequent serial passage into the mouse mouse.
The clinical signs of HCoV-OC43 infection appear similar to the manifestations of HCoV-229E infection, the symptoms of which are inseparable from the infection by other pathogens of the respiratory tract, such as type A influenza viruses and rhinovirus.
Both the HCoV-229E virus and the HCoV-OC43 virus are widespread throughout the world and are usually transmitted in the winter time in moderate widths.
Mostly, the incubation period of these two viruses lasts less than a week, and it follows approximately a two-week disease.
According to the results of the study on volunteers, healthy people infected with the HCoV-229E virus developed a normal light-shaped cold.
Only a few patients with weakened immunity showed a severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
The SARS explosion, also known as an atypical pneumonia epidemic, became the first well-documented pandemic in human history caused by human coronavirus, and the cause of the disease was SARS-CoV, the third of the identified human coronavirus.
The first case of SARS was detected in late 2002 in the Chinese province of Guangdong.
During the SARS epidemic, 8,096 cases of disease and 774 deaths were documented, and the disease spread to many countries and different continents.
Without taking into account the superactive distributors, it was estimated that each patient could infect another approximately two people; the incubation period was from 4 to 7 days, and the peak of viral load was on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially showed muscle pain, headaches, high temperature, general discomfort and swelling, and among the later symptoms were swelling, cough and respiratory failure.
The common deviations of laboratory indicators from the norm in SARS are lymphopenia, liver samples disorders and increased levels of creatininase.
Patients with SARS also have diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and an increase in macrophages.
Approximately 20–30% of patients then need intensive therapy and mechanical lung ventilation.
In such severe cases, in addition to the lower respiratory tract, other organs, including gastrointestinal, liver and kidney organs, can also be infected, which is usually accompanied by a cytokine storm that can be fatal, especially in patients with weakened immunity.
For the first time, the virus was extracted from an open lung biopsy of a relative of a patient who arrived in Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, huge efforts have been focused on the study of human coronavirus.
At the end of 2004, HCoV-NL63 was issued to a 7-month child from the Netherlands.
It was first found that it mainly affects younger children, elderly people and patients with weakened immunity and respiratory diseases.
For the disease caused by HCoV-NL63, symptoms such as colds, conjunctivitis, high temperature and bronchiolitis are characteristic.
Another independent study described the secretion of the same virus from the nose material taken from a 8-month-old boy from the Netherlands suffering from pneumonia.
The virus has been discovered in the Netherlands, but in fact it is spread everywhere.
According to estimates, HCoV-NL63 is the cause of approximately 4.7% of widespread respiratory diseases, and the peak of diseases it causes is at the beginning of summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, which is also called cereal.
HCoV-HKU1 was issued in Hong Kong in the same year from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis.
In addition to non-hospital pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 is associated with exacerbation of asthmatic diseases.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, the HCoV-HKU1 virus that causes light form respiratory diseases has been detected worldwide.
All these four human coronavirus that cause out-of-hospital infections were well adapted to humans, and their mutation, which leads to highly pathogenic diseases, is usually unlikely, although the incidents were and their causes are unknown, as in a rare case with a more virulent subtype HCoV-NL63, which, according to recent reports, caused a serious infection of the lower respiratory tract in China.
Usually, by acquiring the ability to effectively be transmitted and preserved in the human body, these human coronavirus become less virulent or pathogenic.
The coronavirus of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) was first issued in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and renal insufficiency.
The majority of the laboratory-confirmed cases occurred in the Middle East, but in different European countries and in Tunisia, transit and spread were recorded through episodial secondary cases of infection with close contacts.
Another secondary explosion with 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.
Clinical manifestations of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) resemble symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) - both infections are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal insufficiency, which still distinguishes MERS from other diseases caused by coronavirus that are transmitted to humans.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome with high mortality (34,4%), so MERS-CoV is considered one of the most fatal viruses known to humans.
During the period from the middle to the end of December 2019, clusters of patients with pneumonia were detected in Uhan, the Chinese province of Hubei, which is now linked to the infection caused by the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The World Health Organization has announced that the ongoing outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 infection is a global public health emergency, and the disease itself has been called the “coronavirus infection 19” (COVID-19).
As of March 3, 2020, 90.053 confirmed cases have been recorded in the world, with a mortality rate of approximately 3.4%.
It should be noted that the mortality rate in the Chinese province of Hubei is 4.2%, and beyond it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2, like the coronavirus of SARS and MERS, causes a severe respiratory infection characterized by an increase in temperature, cough and breathing.
Some patients also have diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly go into the syndrome of acute respiratory failure.
Despite the similarities of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, given the high homology of nucleotide sequences (82%), these viruses, however, form different branches of the philogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is obviously less pathogenic, but has greater transmission capacity compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of non-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection have been recorded, which indicates the ability of this virus to rapidly spread around the world.
As a result of the comparison and comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronavirus, important similarities and differences are identified.
First, the coronavirus that is transmitted to a person has a similar incubation period and the duration of the course of the diseases they cause.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates the same trend as the remaining six human coronavirus.
Secondly, according to the severity of the symptoms, COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and four human coronavirus that cause non-hospital infections (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, the manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection are similar to what is most commonly observed when infected with human coronavirus, causing non-hospital infections, including non-specific manifestations, mild symptoms or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, as with SARS-CoV infection, you can distinguish a small subgroup of severe cases of COVID-19, although the ratio here is slightly lower.
Third, in terms of the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 there are also interesting patterns that are characteristic of both human coronavirus that cause outpatient infections and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as in human coronavirus that causes non-hospital infections.
On the other hand, it remains to be checked whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is reduced with each subsequent transition of the virus (i.e. infection of each subsequent person), as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other human coronavirus that cause out-of-hospital infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in mole samples.
We still have to answer the question of whether the fecal oral transmission path of SARS-CoV-2 is as significant (at least under certain circumstances) as in the case of SARS-CoV.
Special interest is also the question of the possible seasonality of SARS-CoV-2, characteristic of human coronavirus, causing non-hospital infections.
However, the future development of the continuing COVID-19 explosion will depend on the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including transmission, pathogenicity and sustainable spread after transition through humans.
All four human coronavirus caused out-of-hospital infections with symptoms of light shape were well adapted to humans.
On the other hand, it may be that people have adapted well to these four human coronavirus.
In other words, both those and others could be called the only survivors after human coronavirus pandemies in the past.
Human coronavirus that cause severe diseases in humans, and people whose human coronavirus causes severe diseases, simply do not survive.
For this to happen, human coronavirus must be replicated in the human body in sufficient extent to accumulate adaptive mutations that counteract the carrier restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 explosion lasts and the more people are infected, the greater the chance that the virus will fully adapt to the person.
If it is well adapted, it will be difficult to stop its transmission among people with the help of quarantine or other measures to control infectious diseases.
For many years, four non-hospital coronavirus have circulated among the population, causing a common cold in people with healthy immunity.
These viruses do not require animal reservoir.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV coronavirus have not adapted well enough to humans, and their transmission among humans cannot beined.
They need to be preserved and multiplied in their zoonic tanks and to look for the case of getting into sensitive human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate or enhancing carriers.
SARS-CoV-2 has traits similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV, and four outpatient HCoV viruses.
It is very easily transmitted as an outpatient HCoV, at least right now.
But it is more pathogenic than non-hospital HCoV, and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it is fully adapted to man and whether it will circulate in the human environment without a tank or with an intermediate animal carrier.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoV viruses, it will be useful for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, intermediate, enhancing and tank HCoV viruses.
An animal serves as an evolutionary carrier of HCoV if it carries a near-born ancestor with the same high homology at the level of nucleotide sequence.
The predecessor virus is usually well adapted and non-patogenic in this carrier.
Similarly, the reservoir carrier constantly carries HCoV for a long time.
In both cases, the carriers are naturally infected and are natural carriers of HCoV or its parent virus.
In contrast, if HCoV was only entered into the intermediate carrier right before or near the time when it was entered into a person, it was not well adapted to the new carrier and was often pathogenic.
This intermediate carrier can serve as a zoonic source of human infection and play the role of an enhancing carrier, allowing the virus to replicate flashfully, and then transmitted it to people, increasing the scale of infection of people.
HCoV can be infected if it can’t tolerate the transmission within the intermediate carrier.
On the contrary, HCoV viruses can also adapt to the intermediate carrier and even establish prolonged endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate carrier becomes a natural tank carrier.
Epidemiological data retrospectively showed that a zero SARS patient had in history contact with hunting-industrial animals (dichy).
Further seroprevalence studies have shown that animal traders have a higher prevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV than the general population.
The Himalayan cows (Paguma larvata) and the enotype dog on the markets of living animals have become the first established carriers of viruses, similar and almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly confirmed by the fact that after the destruction of all cyvets on the markets, SARS cases were no longer.
At the same time, it was that Himalayan cows living in nature or on farms and not marketed in most cases, SARS-CoV was not determined, which allows to conclude that Himalayan cows could only serve as an intermediate booster and not a natural SARS-CoV tank.
It is noted that since 80% of the different animals on the Guangzhou markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, it is not possible to exclude the possibility that numerous species of small mammals can also serve as intermediate enhancing carriers.
All of them seem to be the foolish carriers of the SARS-CoV virus.
The subsequent search for the natural carrier of the SARS-CoV identified the near-covered CoV of flying mice, which was called associated with atypical pneumonia coronavirus of subcovered flying mice HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) and which is present in Chinese subcovered flying mice.
These mice are positive on antibodies to SARS-CoV and the genetic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other coronavirus of flying mice have 88–92% the same homology of nucleotide sequence as SARS-CoV.
These studies put the foundation of a new concept that flying mice became the carriers of new human pathogens.
Flying mice also identified several SARS-like coronavirus (SL-CoV), but none of them, except one that indicates WIV1, cannot be isolated as a living virus.
It is known that the SARS-CoV receptor is the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
It has been shown that WIV1, obtained from a flying mouse fecal sample, uses ACE2 flying mouse, cave and humans as a receptor for entering the cell.
Interestingly, serum healing patients with SARS could neutralize WIV1.
Today, WIV1 represents the closest relative ancestor of SARS-CoV in flying mice, dividing 95% of the homology of nucleotide sequences.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct parental SARS-CoV virus, and flying mice are not the direct reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV.
The philogenetic analysis relates MERS-CoV to the same group as both CoV-HKU4 flying mice and CoV-HKU5 flying mice.
CoV-HKU4 flying mice and MERS-CoV use the same carrier receptor, Dipetyldipeptidase-4 (DPP4), to penetrate viruses.
The RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase sequence of MERS-CoV is philogenetically closer to the sequences of flying mice beta-coronavirus identified in Europe and Africa.
Until now, wild flying mice did not find a living MERS-CoV virus.
The homology of nucleotide sequences of MERS-CoV and its closest relative CoV-HKU25 flying mice coincides only by 87%.
That is, flying mice could not be the direct tank carrier of the MERS-CoV virus.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that single-purpose worms are seropositive to MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, as well as the Middle East worms in many African countries.
The living MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in humans, has been separated from the nasal mucus of single-purpose worms, which further confirms the role of worms as real MERS-CoV tank carriers.
It is also worth noting that worms experimentally infected with MERS-CoV had minor symptoms, but massive viral emission.
It is noted that infected worms have secreted the virus not only by respiratory, but also by fecal oral, which is also the main way of secreting the virus in flying mice.
However, there are still questions as many confirmed cases of the Middle East respiratory syndrome have not had any history of contact with the worms before the symptoms occurred and are credibly related to the cost of transmission from man to man or transmission by unknown channels, including uncovered species of animals that are the MERS-CoV carriers.
The homology of SARS-CoV-2 nucleotides at 96.2% coincides with the RaTG13 coV of flying mice issued in Asian submarines Rhinolophus affinis.
Like in the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to attribute them parental relationships.
That is, flying mice could not be the direct reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV-2, unless in the future almost identical coronavirus of flying mice will be found.
It is supposed that direct carrier animals of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wild species that are sold and killed on the Uhan’s wholesale market of seafood, which has been linked to many initial cases of COVID-19, which indicates a likely case of transmission from animal to human.
Several recent studies based on methogenic sequencing have concluded that a group of threatened to destroy small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) could also be tolerated by parental beta-coronavirus, related to the SARS-CoV-2 strain.
The homology of the sequence of nucleotides of these new genoms of the coronavirus of the pinguins at 85–92% coincides with SARS-CoV-2.
But they are also closely linked to RaTG13, with the identity at the level of nucleotide sequence is about 90%.
They are classified in two differentiation zones of viruses, similar to SARS-CoV-2, in a philogenetic tree, one of which has a receptor-binding domain (RSD) closer to SARS-CoV-2 with an amino acid sequence identity of 97.4%.
On the contrary, the RSD of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 strains are more diversified, despite a higher degree of homology of sequence throughout the genome.
In a earlier study of patients with pangolins, it was also to identify viral contagions in lung samples that were similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
In this study, other methods of assembly and manual treatment were used to obtain a genome sequence, which comprises approximately 86.3% of the full-dimensional virus genome.
The possibility is not excluded that the pinguin has become one of the intermediate animal carriers of SARS-CoV-2.
However, due to the divergence of sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and the baccoronavirus of the pinguins related to SARS-CoV-2, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 from the pinguins.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and the beta-coronavirus of the pinguins associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in flying mice, pinguins and other mammals is not yet established.
While the highest homology of sequence was found in the RSD between SARS-CoV-2 and the beta-coronavirus of the pinguins related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest homology of sequence within the entire genome.
Very theoretically, a high degree of similarity between the beta-coronavirus of the pinguins related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is associated with parallel evolution through selectivity.
The opposite proposal is for the re-combination of the beta-coronavirus of the pinguins, related to SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 in the third form of wild animals.
As the driving force of evolution, recombination is widely prevalent among beta-coronavirus.
There is still no final decision on the direct zoonic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to the highly pathogenic HCoV viruses, the zoonic origin of the HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses is also studied.
Philogenetic evidence shows that both HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E may arise from flying mice coronavirus, while parental HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses are detected in worms.
The coronavirus of flying mice, named ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) and detected in a North American three-colored prescoscope, was to be close to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically linked to another flying mouse coronavirus called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, although there was a suspicion that its intermediate carrier could also be verbula.
For clarity, modern knowledge of the animal origin of known coronavirus is summarized in Figure 1 and in Table 2.
The philogenetic analysis gave evidence of the events of intertype transmission of HCoV in the history.
When around 1890 the HCoV-OC43 virus was transmitted and humans were infected by domestic animals, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The history of inter-type transmission HCoV-229E is not so clear.
The alpha coronavirus of flying mice, HCoV-229E, was discovered.
Among them is the alpha coronavirus of alpha.
Some data support the direct transmission of the virus from flying mice to humans.
First, it was people, not alpacks, who could contact flying mice in a general environmental niche.
At the same time, people are in close contact with the alpacks.
Second, the alpha coronavirus of flying mice, similar to HCoV-229E, in flying mice is diverse and non-pathogenic, while the alpha coronavirus of alpha caused an attack of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Ultimately, alpha coronavirus was not found in wild animals.
Thus, it is not possible to exclude the possibility that the alpacks received the alpha coronavirus, related to HCoV-229E, from humans.
In fact, flying mice are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including anger virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that flying mice could transmit directly to humans HCoV-229E.
On the other hand, while the alpha coronavirus of flying mice could serve as the genetic pillar of the HCoV-229E virus, the alpha and single-mile verbs could become intermediate carriers that transmit the viruses to humans, just as in the case of the MERS-CoV virus.
MERS-CoV serves as a great example of inter-type transmission from flying mice to single-wheels and from single-wheels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV virus from flying mice is known by its original identification and was then confirmed by subsequent studies.
It is obvious that flying mice gives a rich pool of varieties of viruses for inter-type exchange of genetic fragments and inter-type transmission.
Long-life, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and the ability to fly make flying mice “ideal distributors.”
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus was introduced to single-borne worms decades ago.
It was well adapted to these verbules, which from the intermediate carrier turned into a stable and natural tank carrier.
In these animals, the MERS-CoV virus causes a very light disease and is characterized by a relatively low frequency of mutations.
Its episodic transmission to a person is a coincidence, and the person remains a foolish MERS-CoV carrier, as its transmission is not supported.
Unlike the role of worms in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pinguins, if there is, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, the beta-coronavirus of pangolins are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be foolish carriers of beta-coronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2, as well as coves in the case of SARS-CoV.
In future studies it is necessary to confirm or exclude several possibilities of intertype transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans.
First, flying mice can be a tank carrier for a SARS-CoV-2-related virus, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
People can share the environmental niche with flying mice thanks to the carbon production or the separation of the shells of these animals.
Secondly, pinguins can be one of the intermediate boosting carriers that the related SARS-CoV-2 virus has recently hit.
People are infected with the virus through the division of the shoes and the eating of the meat of wild animals.
It is possible that many animals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
The study of domestic and wild animals on antibodies is justified.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could occur in a third form that contacted both flying mice and pinguins.
The search for animal origin SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
In addition to different types of carrier animals, three main factors from the side of viruses also contributed to the crossing of intertype barriers.
First of all, their relatively high rate of mutations in the RNA replication.
Compared to other viruses with one-stop RNA, the calculated rate of coronavirus mutations can be considered "moderate-high" with an average rate of replacement of approximately 10–4 replacement per year in one area 2 depending on the phase of coronavirus adaptation to new hosts.
Coronavirus has correctional exoribonuclease, the removal of which leads to extremely high frequency of mutation and weakening or even inability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir suppresses the replication of coronavirus thanks to the inhibition of this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising drugs against SARS-CoV-2, which should be tested during clinical trials.
However, the frequency of coronavirus mutations is a million times higher than their carriers.
In addition, the mutation frequency can often be even higher if the coronavirus is not adequately adapted to the carrier.
Compared to SARS-CoV with high mutation frequency, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation frequency is apparently lower, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.
It is believed that this virus has already been adapted to another carrier close to the person.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to the MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to single-range verbles.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that the vaccines and antiviral drugs from SARS-CoV-2 quickly lose their effectiveness as a result of a genetic drop.
Second, a large RNA genome in coronavirus leads to greater plasticity in genetic modification in relation to mutations and recombinations, thus increasing the probability of intertype coevolution, favourable for the emergence of new coronavirus in the presence of appropriate conditions.
This is contributed by numerous unique open reading frameworks and protein functions encoded in the direction of the 3′ end of the genome.
Third, thanks to the unique matrix selection mechanism, coronavirus accidentally and often switch the matrix during the RNA replication.
During the transcription of the DNA of the coronavirus in the carrier, which serves as a mixed vessel, the nits are often switched.
High-mological full-dimensional and subgenomic RNAs can recombine and create new coronavirus.
Philogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, and in animal coronavirus such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9 flying mice.
Interaction between the virus and the carrier in relation to transmission
In addition to the three above-mentioned viral factors, another key factor that is important for interviral transmission is the interaction of the virus with the carrier receptor.
In this article, as a typical example, which also demonstrates evidence of positive selection in inter-type transmission events, the SARS-CoV recombination is presented.
Based on a comparative analysis between SARS-CoV human and coves seeds, it is believed that SARS-CoV is rapidly adapted in different carriers, especially when it comes to mutations on S-protein RSD.
In general, the coronavirus S protein RSD interacts with the cell receptor, and the carrier’s antibody response intensely takes it out.
RSDs in SARS-CoV are amino acids, from 318 to 510, on the fragment S1, which for the introduction of the virus into the cell is linked to the angiotensin-reforming enzyme 2 (APF2) of the human, as well as its coreceptors.
SARS-CoV virus RSD is capable of recognizing the APF2 receptors of different animals, including flying mice, cows, mice and enotype dogs, making possible intertype transmission of the virus.
In fact, there were only 6 amino acids remains found in the RSD, which differ from human viral stams and coves, and 4 of them are in the receptor-binding motives for interaction with the APF2 receptor.
SARS-CoV tubes have mutations of K479N and S487T in RSD, which can increase the affinity of the schipoprotein interaction with the human APF2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acids substitutes can be important for the adaptation of the virus to a person.
SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 protein segment leads to the fact that the connectivity of S protein to human APF2 could change.
Indeed, a study using a cryoelectronic microscope shows that the affinity of this connection is 10-20 times higher than between the human APF2 and the SARS-CoV S protein.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any other coreceptors are required for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 is also linked to APF2, but with another segment of protein S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They can also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronavirus in humans after intertype transmission from carrier animals.
In addition to cell receptors, the result of the intertype transmission of HCoV is also controlled by other factors of dependence and limitation of the carrier.
The divergence of these carrier proteins between humans and natural HCoVs tank carrier, such as flying mice, single-range verblows and worms, can be a barrier for intertype transmission.
For the successful inter-type transmission of HCoV viruses, it is necessary to usurp the dependence factors and submit to the carrier restriction factors.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of interaction between the virus and the carrier still need to be defined and categorized.
Good results can provide an unfair full-genomal screening of addiction factors and carrier restrictions for SARS-CoV-2 using the latest CRISPR technology.
The emergence of new HCoVs: Back to zero mark
The variety of coronavirus of flying mice creates wide opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, the coronavirus of flying mice serves as a genetic ball for HCoV.
Furthermore, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also the driving force of HCoV evolution and serve as two important stages in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new proteins coding genes has the potential for radical modification of phenotypes of viruses.
Among the accessory proteins SARS-CoV important for adaptation to humans is considered ORF8, as flying mice viruses, related to SARS-CoV, have been isolated, but it has been found that they codify diversive proteins ORF8.
In the strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic, a 29-nucleotide division, characteristic of the SARS-CoV coronavirus, was found.
This division divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and it is considered an adaptive mutation that accelerates the change of carriers.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombinations with alpha and gamma coronavirus lines, where a large number of smaller recombinant areas were determined in RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase.
Recombination localizations were also determined in non-structured proteins nsp9, most nsp10 and parts nsp14.
Similarly, it was shown that the epidemic MERS-CoV was exposed to re-combinant events between different lines, which occurred in single-border verbules in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events were also observed in other HCoVs where HCoVs were recombined with other animal coronavirus in their non-structured genes.
It is also necessary to be warned that artificial selection may contribute to unintentional changes in viral genoms, which is likely to occur as a result of the virus's release from the exposed selective pressures, for example, by the carrier's immune system.
An example of such effects is the loss of full-dimensional ORF4 in the prototype stam HCoV-229E due to the two-nucleotide division.
While the INTACT open reading frame of ORF4 can be observed in flying mouse and verbula viruses related to HCoV-229E, the alpha-coronavirus of alpaca demonstrates a mononucleotide insert, which leads to a frame shift.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoVs is also due to the pressure of selection on their tank carriers.
When flying mice infected with coronavirus, weak symptoms or their absence were recorded, which indicates mutual adaptation between coronavirus and flying mice.
It turned out that flying mice were anatomically and physiologically well adapted to coronavirus.
For example, defects in the activation of the provocative response in flying mice effectively reduce the pathology caused by coronavirus.
In addition, the natural killer cell activity in flying mice is undermined due to the aprigulation of the inhibitor receptor of natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of the molecules of the main histosompatibility complex of class I.
Furthermore, the high level of active forms of oxygen, which is provided by high metabolic activity of flying mice, can suppress the replication of the coronavirus, at the same time affecting the reading by exoribonuclease, thus creating the selection pressure for the generation of viral stams, which when penetrating into the new carrier are highly pathogenic.
More pathogenic stams of coronavirus can also evolve due to recombination, which leads to the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties to adapt the carrier.
Therefore, it is not an accident that in the last twenty years three new human coronavirus have appeared.
Coronavirus is non-patogenic or causes mild symptoms in their tank carriers, such as flying mice or worms.
They are confidently replicated without causing a strong immune response in the carrier.
This is the secret of why we see unsymptomatic carriers, and what causes severe cases of human infection.
The severe symptoms are mainly associated with the hyperactivation of the immune response and the cytokine storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more serious the lung damage.
On the contrary, in unsymptomatic carriers, the immune response is not associated with the replication of the coronavirus.
The same immune response non-binding strategy may have beneficial effects in the treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
In flying mice, the interferon response is strong.
Thus, taking type I interferon at least at the initial stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should have a beneficial effect.
Furthermore, flying mice disrupts the activation of NLRP3 inflammasoma.
Based on this, the inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasoma with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general scheme under which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV occurred.
While the beta-coronavirus of flying mice, whose nucleotide homology 95% coincides with SARS-CoV, has been found, there is also the coronavirus of flying mice, whose nucleotide homology 96% coincides with SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been found that cows and other animals on the markets carry viruses, the identical SARS-CoV, the direct intermediates for SARS-CoV-2 have not been established.
Pongolin beta-coronavirus, surprisingly homological SARS-CoV-2, was discovered, which indicates that the pongolins could serve as one of the intermediate carriers or that fragments of the pongolin beta-coronavirus genes could enter the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the remaining questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or accidentally created by humans.
Coronavirus has attracted public attention due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 explosion.
The study of coronavirus in flying mice and other animals has radically changed our perception of the importance of Zoo origin and animal reservoirs HCoV in human transmission.
Confidential evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate from flying mice and have been transmitted to humans through intermediate carriers.
If SARS-CoV infection arises from the contact between people and cows on the markets, the closure of wild markets and the destruction of cows on them could effectively put an end to the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in the light of the discovery of a variety of lines of beta-coronavirus pongolins, near-connected SARS-CoV-2, to prevent the zoonous transmission of infection from the food markets, pongolins should be removed.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to a person through pinguins and other mammals and how it can happen remains the task of future research.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has existed for a long time in single-purpose worms.
These worms serve as an important means of transport, as well as the main source of meat, milk, leather and hair products for the local population.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to donate all the worms for the control of MERS, as it was done in China's wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop periodic MERS outbreaks, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop an effective MERS-CoV vaccine for worms in combination with other infectious control measures.
Since we can’t eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may appear that cause the disease’s outbreaks.
There are a variety of Zoo coronavirus circulating around the world.
In particular, the coronavirus of flying mice with zoonic potential is extremely diverse.
There is a huge number of possibilities for the evolution and re-combination of these zodiac coronavirus, which in the future will lead to the emergence of new coronavirus that are easier to transmit and (or) more fatal to humans.
In order to reduce the number of excessive contacts between humans and animals, it is necessary to give up the culture of food for wild animals in some areas of China.
After rigorous tests such as SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparation and plan of response to such situations are needed.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural tanks until there is the possibility of capturing new territories.
Although many properties of flying mice are favorable to the spread of viruses, if you teach people to keep away from them, you can minimize the likelihood of a person’s contact with flying mice and other species of wild animals.
For a better understanding of the ecology of coronavirus and their natural carriers, a constant epidemiological supervision of mammals is required, which will be useful to prevent the transmission of coronavirus from animals to humans and future outbreaks of diseases.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to keep people away from the environmental niches of natural zoonose viruses.
SARS-CoV-2 is still missing some fragments.
First, if flying mice transmitted the predecessor SARS-CoV-2 virus to the pinguins, it is interesting to see under what circumstances flying mice and pinguins divide the same environmental niche.
Second, if the flying mice plays a more direct role in the transmission to a person, then it is necessary to determine how people have entered contact with the flying mice.
Third, if the role of the true intermediate carrier is played by the third mammal, then it is necessary to find out how it interacts with different species, including humans, flying mice and pinguins.
Finally, since many mammals, including pets, can be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, epidemiological supervision and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether it’s a flying mouse, pinguin or other mammal, it’s expected that in the future SARS-CoV-2 or its predecessors will be identified in their natural carriers.
Further research in this field will light the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have important consequences for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for “such cases of illness” and “confirmed cases” COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our group published a short reference guide on the diagnosis and treatment of the new coronavirus infection 2019 (2019-nCoV), which provides information about the experience we have acquired and gives confirmed recommendations on combating this pandemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge has been increased gradually on the basis of current research and clinical experience; thus the diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice are also constantly updated.
In this letter we answered one comment on our recommendations and present the latest diagnostic criteria for “such cases of illness” and “confirmed cases” in accordance with the document “Recommendations for diagnosis and therapy for COVID-19” (seventh version), issued by the National Health Committee of China.
In December 2019, a new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) exploded, which was now officially named coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), and the viral disease itself was named "heavy acute respiratory syndrome 2" (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our group developed a short reference guide and published it online on the website of the Military Medical Research magazine on February 6, 2020.
This publication attracted great attention.
COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge has been increased gradually on the basis of current research and clinical experience; thus the diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice are also constantly updated.
For example, between January 16 and March 3, 2020, seven publications of the document “Recommendations on Diagnosis and Therapy for COVID-19” published by the National Health Committee of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), with the content of some of its provisions significantly changed.
Recently, in the work prepared by Zhou (Zhou) with co-authors, comments were made about our recommendations. They contained simple diagnostic suggestions based on the already existing clinical experience.
This work added new practical evidence to our recommendations and also presented valuable reference information on this worldwide pandemic.
We confirm the great importance of their work and express our gratitude.
However, according to the latest edition “Diagnostic and Therapy Recommendations for COVID-19” (Test Seventh Version) and the results of current studies, and their work needs to be updated.
In accordance with the seventh edition of this document (from March 3, 2020) for a comprehensive analysis to confirm the case of suspicion of the disease it is necessary to combine any one element of the characteristics of the epidemiological history with two clinical manifestations of the disease:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of movement or residence in Uhan and its surroundings or in other settlements where cases of COVID-19 were registered within 14 days before the symptoms occurred; (2) history of contacts with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test based on nucleic acids); (3) history of contacts with patients with high temperature or respiratory symptoms from Uhan and its surroundings or from other settlements where cases of COVID-19 were registered within the last 14 days before the symptoms occurred; (4) history of contacts with groups of persons with confirmed diseases (≥ 2 cases characterized by high temperature or respiratory symptoms, not registered in 2 squares or squares in such schools, squares or squares).
Clinical manifestations: (1) high temperature and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) the presence of external manifestations of COVID-19 infection; (3) the total number of leukocytes is normal or decreased with reduced number of lymphocytes in the early stages of symptoms manifestation.
The diagnosis for the confirmed case of the disease should be based on the case of suspicion of the disease with the presence of one of the following points of pathogenetic or serological evidence, namely: (1) the real-time PCR test is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the full-genomic sequencing of the virus shows high homogeneity relative to new coronavirus; (3) the positive serotest results for specific to SARS-CoV-2 antibodies IgM and IgG; or the change of the test result from negative to positive for specific to SARS-CoV-2 antibodies IgG, or the increase of the titres at least 4 times on the phase of recovery relative to the corresponding indicator on the phase.
It can also be noted that in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) releases of the document, a real-time PCR test for nucleic acids in the respiratory tract or blood samples was added.
The pathogenetic diagnosis of the blood sample was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and the fifth (8 February 2020) releases; and then in the seventh releases the need for serological evidence was added.
These changes are based on the results of the continuous work of researchers engaged in finding the optimal set for detection of nucleic acids in a quick diagnosis, as well as for the analysis of samples taken from the respiratory tract, including the selection of blood samples, which increases the availability of different samples and contributes to the inclusion of positive test results for specific antibodies in the disease confirmation criteria.
At the same time, there is more and more evidence of the need to be cautious when treating patients with atypical symptoms and patients without severe symptoms.
Thus, the route map presented in the work of Zhou (Zhou) etc. should be updated, as in it persons without clinical symptoms are classified as a “low-risk” group.
The assessment system also requires clarification during further clinical practice and studies.
In conclusion, we hope to get more direct evidence and urge readers to leave their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of "such cases of disease" and "confirmed cases", we suggest readers to monitor and strictly follow the latest recommendations given in the countries where they live.
Our team will also update its recommendations in time in order to provide effective assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths as a result of COVID-19 – daily maximum
Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 per day.
This is the highest number of deaths from the virus per day.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Control and Disease Studies (IEDCR) that among the registered cases of infection included 114 current cases, as well as 33 healed patients who were at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online briefing, IEDCR director Dr. Mirjabi Sabrina Flora said that four men and one woman were killed.
According to Dr. Mirjabi, two of the deceased were aged 60 years old, two aged 51 to 60 years old, and one aged 41 to 50.
She also that two of the dead were from Dhaka.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a COVID-19 pandemic.
A clinic employee told the local news agency Anadolu that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, the director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated in the Kuwait's Meatri Clinic.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh’s road transport and bridges minister Obadul Quader said that public transport will be stopped for a longer period than was initially planned, until next Saturday.
Public transport work was stopped on March 26 and was to be renewed on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of first-need goods – drugs, fuel and food – was still permitted.
The first cases of COVID-19 infection were recorded in Bangladesh on March 8 in two people who returned from Italy, as well as the wife of one of them.
As of March 19, these three people have already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has exceeded the world’s million infection limit
According to the Johns Hopkins University, on Thursday, the total number of cases of coronavirus infection SARS-CoV-2 worldwide exceeded one million.
At least 52,000 people have died of the COVID-19 coronavirus.
The rubage occurred on the same day that the first case of infection was confirmed in Malawi, and the first case of death from the coronavirus was recorded in Zambia.
North Korea said on Thursday it was one of the few countries in which no cases of coronavirus infection were recorded.
According to yesterday, the World Health Organization 1 051 635 confirmed cases of infection, including 79 332 cases in twenty-four hours before 10:00 in Central European time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus infection were registered, of which at least 5,900 were fatal.
CBS News, referring to data from the Johns Hopkins University, that more than 1,000 deaths caused by coronavirus infection were recorded in the U.S. on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have announced to strengthen measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow mayor Sergey Sobyanin extended the regime of self-isolation of citizens of the city until May 1.
Previously, President Vladimir Putin said that Russians throughout the country, despite self-isolation, will receive wages until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted for the extension of the state of emergency for 15 days; the results of the vote: 215 votes for, ten abstained and one against.
Saudi Arabia has extended the command time in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for a full day, while earlier the command time lasted only from 3 a.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand planned to introduce a command time from 10 p.m. to 4 p.m.
The governor of Ohio, Mike Deweyn, announced that the regime of domestic self-isolation in the state was extended by the order until May 1.
Australian stores limit the number of packages of toilet paper that can be purchased once
On Sunday and Saturday evening, the Australian Woolworths and Coles shops networks reduced the number of packages of toilet paper, which can be purchased once in all shops of the country, to two and one packages respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a limit on one package.
These restrictions were in the ads on the casks, as well as on the Facebook page.
Citizens began to make emergency reserves because of the fears that COVID-19 could trigger the introduction of a system of general self-isolation.
On Wednesday, the Woolworths network also limited the amount of toilet paper purchased to one package.
Earlier, on 4 and 5 March respectively, Woolworths and Coles have already limited this number to 4 packages.
The Coles trading network in its March 8 press release that with the introduction of a restriction on four packages “in many stores toilet paper is still purchased too quickly – one delivery within an hour,” and called such demand “unprecedented,” while ALDI in a Facebook post published Tuesday called this trend “unprecedented.”
According to Woolworths, there was a sharp increase in sales last week.
The Costco store in Canberra last week also limited this number to two packages.
To fill out the deficit, Coles began to order from suppliers bigger parties and increased the frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered additional parties, while ALDI made stocks for a special early sale action on Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retail Association, said retailers are trying to fill up stocks, but this is complicated due to local authorities’ restrictions on truck schedules.
It is expected to increase the cost of products, as suppliers are trying to satisfy demand, but there are less and less profitable offers available.
ALDI announced on Tuesday that some stores could not hold shares on Wednesday due to the exhaust of stocks.
In the News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert from the Queensland University of Technology, said that stores fill up stocks every night.
He noted that the toilet paper is a thin good, so the number of warehouses is small, and after the total volume of the goods is sold, the long rows of the rows remain empty, increasing the feeling of lack of warehouses.
“Coles and Woolworths believe that if the plots could be filled, and goods such as toilet paper rolls and hand disinfectants could be placed on these plots in large amounts, buyers probably’t get so panic,” says Russell Zimmerman.
Last Wednesday, the manufacturer of processed toilet paper Who Gives a Crap announced the end of the stock.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, the company-producer of toilet paper Kleenex and Solaris Paper, also producing products of the brand Sorbent, that they work 24 hours a day to provide a sufficient amount of goods.
Domain.com, the real estate sales site, that when the number of auctions in Melbourne dropped due to the lack of buyers on the week of Labour Day, some real estate sellers began offering the first participants of the auctions a free toilet paper.
The fourth edition of the daily edition NT News, printed in Darwin, included an eight-page folder designed to be cut and used as a toilet paper.
According to ABC Australia’s March 3 report, the shops initially unwantedly introduced restrictions on the number of purchased goods, stating that they do not plan to do so.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in increased demand, including medical masks, hand disinfectants, gallanters, handwashers and flour.
Similarly, in addition to the events in Australia, on Sunday evening it was noticed that the UK supermarket’s online store Ocado also restricted the sale of Andres’ toilet paper with two packages per 12 rounds.
World Health Organization declares COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a pandemic of the infectious disease COVID-19, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the fact that the term “pandemia” characterizes only the scale of the disease and not the danger of specific cases, WHO notes that governments of countries need to take measures:
“All countries are still able to influence the development of the pandemic.”
This is possible if the countries will engage in the detection, testing, treatment, isolation of the sick, tracking the occurrence of the disease, as well as mobilizing their citizens,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Adan Hebrelius.
“We are deeply concerned about both the anxious level of spread and severity of the disease and the anxious level of inaction.”
According to Dr. Tom Friedman, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this pandemic is “unprecedented.”
He said in an interview broadcast on CNN in February that “no other respiratory virus except the flu has been traced since its emergence until its continuous global spread.”
Mr. Hebrews expressed a similar point of view, saying, “We have never seen a pandemic caused by the coronavirus.
We have also never seen a pandemic that can be controlled before.”
First, in January, the WHO declared the outbreak of this disease as an emergency in the field of public health of international importance, and then attributed it a new status - a pandemic.
Director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Faucci, said: “This is just the beginning, it will be worse.”
According to the Associated Press, at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 were registered worldwide on Thursday, more than 4,600 people died.
The coronavirus pandemic 2019-2020 is the current coronavirus pandemic 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The explosion was detected in Uhan, China, in December 2019, and on January 30, 2020, an emergency of international importance in the field of public health was declared, which was later recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were registered in 210 countries and regions, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Approximately 364,000 people have recovered.
The mortality rate in China is 4%, while in the world it ranges from 13,04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
Possible complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from the first manifestation of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but it can also vary from two to fourteen days.
Currently, no vaccine or specific treatment is found.
The main treatment has a symptomatic and supporting nature. Recommended preventive measures include washing the hands, covering the mouth for cough, keeping the distance between people, identifying and ensuring self-isolation of people suspected of their infection.
Authorities around the world have reacted to the situation by introducing travel restrictions, quarantine measures, command time, risk control at work and closing various facilities.
The pandemic has led to serious global socio-economic consequences, the transfer or cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural events, as well as the widespread lack of goods, aggravated by panic purchases.
Schools and universities were closed at national or regional levels in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4% of students around the world.
The Internet began to spread misinformation about the virus, there were cases of xenophobia and discrimination against citizens of China, other citizens of Eastern and Southeast Asia, or people reminding them from the outside, as well as against other groups of people living in areas where significant cases of the virus spread were.
As a result of the reduction in the number of trips and the closure of heavy industries, air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased.
On 31 December 2019, the health authorities of the city of Uhan (the capital of the province of Hubei), China, cases of unknown cause pneumonia, and in early January 2020 the investigation of the situation was started.
Infection cases were mainly associated with the Huanang seafood wholesale market, so the virus is believed to have zoonic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak of the disease is known as SARS-CoV-2. This is a recently discovered virus that has a great similarity with flying mouse coronavirus, pinguin coronavirus and SARS-CoV. Later it was found that the first case of the disease occurred on December 1, 2019 and the infected person did not visit the market after that date.
Two-thirds of the infection cases registered in December 2019 were related to this market.
On March 13, 2020 in the South-Chinese department of Morning Post, the information not verified, the assumption that the first case of infection occurred with a 55-year-old inhabitant of the Hubei province on November 17, 2019 was stated. on February 26, 2020 WHO that the number of new cases of infection occurred in China decreased, but was suddenly growing in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and the number of new cases of infection outside of China for the first time exceeded the number of new cases of infection in China itself.
The number of cases of the disease can be significantly reduced, in particular due to a number of cases with poor symptoms.
By February 26, relatively few cases of infection were recorded among young people, with patients aged 19 and younger accounting for less than 2.4% of cases worldwide. United Kingdom's chief scientific adviser Patrick Wallace estimated that 60% of the British population will be infected until effective group immunity is formed in the country's population.
Statistics include cases of infection of people who were tested on COVID-19, and whose test was positive according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country was able to check more than 3% of its population, and in many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, a formal policy was adopted that prescribes not to perform tests if only small symptoms occur.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, until January 23, 86% of COVID-19 infections were not detected, and that such unregistered patients became the source of infection for 79% of registered cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 showed that the number of cases of actual infection in Italy significantly exceeded the number of registered cases.
The initial estimates of the basic reproductive number of infection (R0) by COVID-19 were from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that this figure may be 5.7.
Most patients with COVID-19 are healed well.
In other, more complicated cases, the time from the beginning of symptoms to the moment of death was from 6 to 41 days, the most common period is 14 days.
By 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were related to COVID-19.
As of February 5, about 80% of deaths occurred in people over the age of 60 and 75% of the deaths had accompanying diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official data of deaths from COVID-19 pandemic usually include information about deaths of patients with positive COVID test results, carried out according to official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as official figures may not take into account the dead people who have not passed the test — for example, in case of death at home, in the homes of elderly, etc.
Incomplete data on Italy indicate that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID indicators by 4-5 times.
A spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledges: “We know that [the number of deaths] is below the actual.” His words are confirmed by reports of some individual cases in the U.S. A similar record with incomplete data is often found in pandemies such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic. The first confirmed death was recorded in Uhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside of China was recorded on February 1 in the Philippines, and outside of Asia on February 14 in France.
By February 28, more than a dozen deaths were registered outside China: in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By March 13, more than 40 countries and regions on all continents, except the Antarctic, deaths.
All indicators vary depending on the region and time of disease spread; they are also influenced by the test volumes, the quality of health systems, the treatment schemes used, the time from the beginning of the disease outbreak and the population parameters such as age, gender and general health. The "death/sickness" factor represents the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed infection cases over a given time interval.
According to statistics from the Johns Hopkins University, by 10 April 2020 the global number of deaths and infections is 6.0% (97 039/1 617 204).
The data is different in different regions.
In China, the mortality ratio to infection rate decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms occurred from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms occurred after 1 February 2020). Other methods include determining the rate of disease-related mortality (CFR) - the rate of diagnosed patients dying from the disease, and the rate of infection-related mortality (IFR), which reflects the rate of infected (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) patients dying from the disease.
These statistics are not linked to a specific time and reflect the indicators of certain groups of population from the moment of infection to the end of the course of the disease.
Some scientists tried to calculate these indicators by specific groups of people.
According to the Center for Proof Medicine at Oxford University, the mortality rate from this pandemic is generally from 0.1 to 0.39%.
The top figure of this range coincides with the results of the first random test on COVID-19 in Germany, as well as with a statistical study that analyzes the impact of the test on CFR assessments.
The WHO says the current pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and the exact duration of the explosion cannot be determined and may vary depending on the location.
Matthew Bonnie, an employee at the Pennsylvania State University, says that “uncontrolled infectious outbreaks usually come out on the plateau, and then when the number of available carriers of the disease is over, they begin to disappear.
However, in the current situation, it is practically impossible to make any reasonable prediction about when this will happen.”
China’s senior medical adviser, Zhong Nanjing, said that “all could end by June” if all countries could mobilize and follow WHO’s recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 “will circulate,, within a year or two.”
According to a study conducted by the Imperial College under the leadership of Neil Ferguson, “until the vaccine is created (possibly 18 months or more)”, physical distancing measures and other measures will be required.
William Shaffner, an employee at the University of Vanderbilt, says: “I don’t think this coronavirus will ever disappear completely, because it is so easily transmitted,” and that it “can turn into a seasonal disease, exploding every year.”
The virility of new eruptions will depend on collective immunity and the degree of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific, and some infected people may bear the disease without any symptoms.
Two of the most common symptoms are high temperature (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, formation of swelling in the respiratory tract (slip), loss of odor, breathing, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headache, swelling, vomiting, blood clots, diarrhea or cyanosis. WHO claims that he is sick in a serious form with the development of respiratory problems about every six people.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists such urgent symptoms as breathing difficulties, constant pain or sensation of swelling in the chest, sudden sensation of consciousness, difficulty with awakening and bleeding of the face or lips. In the presence of these symptoms, you should immediately seek medical help. The further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory stress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
In some infected people, the disease may be symptomatic, without any clinical manifestations, but the results of the tests confirm the fact of infection, so doctors recommend placing persons in close contact with patients whose diagnosis is confirmed, under strict monitoring and examination of the subject of infection.
According to Chinese scientists, the number of cases of unsymptomatic course of the disease ranges from several units to 44% of all cases.
The usual incubation period (time between infection and the appearance of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; it is usually five days. Until now there is no complete clarity about the symptom of odor loss: according to initial estimates, the percentage of patients with COVID-19, who developed this symptom, was initially 30%, and then fell to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still unknown.
It is believed that the disease is mainly transmitted during close contact, as well as through small drops emitting into the air along with cough, chewing or during conversation; close contact involves contact in a radius of 1 to 2 meters (from 3 to 6 feet).
According to some studies with open cough, drops can spread at a distance from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
There are assumptions that the virus can also be transmitted through small drops thrown into the air during the conversation, which can remain in the air for a longer time. Respiratory drops can also be formed during the breath, including during the conversation, although the virus is not usually transmitted through the air.
Drops can fall into the mouth or nose of some people, as well as into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as infusion and cardiovascular resuscitation, may lead to dispersion of respiratory products and consequently to the spread of the virus in the air.
It can also penetrate the body if a person touches the contaminated surface, including the skin, with a subsequent touch to his eyes, nose or mouth.
There are also concerns that the virus can be transmitted through the feces, but the risk of this method of transmission is considered low.
The Chinese government denies the possibility of fecal oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most infectious within the first three days after the symptoms appear, although its spread can occur both before the symptoms appear and in the later stages of the disease.
There were cases when the tests were positive in the trial three days before the symptoms appear, and this indicates the possibility of the virus to a strong manifestation of the symptoms.
There are only a few reports of lab-confirmed cases of unsymptomatic disease, but contact tracking studies in some countries have also identified cases of disease transmission from unsymptomatic carriers.
The staff of the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) claim that it is not yet quite clear how easily the virus spreads, yet it is known that one patient usually infects 2–3 other people.
In particular, it was found that on the plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (304) the virus can live up to three days, on the carton surface - for one day, and on the copper surfaces - up to 4 hours.
These data, however, vary depending on moisture and temperature. Homes and other animals received a positive result on COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities advise to wash hands after contact with animals, just as after contact with other surfaces that infected people could touch.
The severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus first detected in three people with pneumonia from the group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Uhan.
All the signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in nature in related coronavirus. Outside the human body the virus can be destroyed with the help of household soap that dissolves its protective membrane. SARS-CoV-2 has a great similarity with the original SARS-CoV virus.
It is believed to have Zoo origin.
The genetic analysis of the coronavirus showed that it is genetically clustered with the genus Betacoronavirus, the subgenus Sarbecovirus (cell line B) together with two other species of flying mice viruses.
At a fully genetic level, it is 96% identical to other coronavirus patterns of the flying mouse (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of the genome sequence of the pandoline and human viruses.
A comprehensive and genetic comparison to date has shown that the highest percentage of similarity (92%) is between the coronavirus of the pinguin and SARS-CoV-2, but this is not enough to prove that the pinguins are the intermediate hosts of the virus.
Viral infection can be pre-diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although ultimately this should be confirmed by analysing a polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcription (RT-PCR) of the infected secret or computer tomography.
The results of a study comparing the PCR and CT methods used in Uhan showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, as many of its visualization functions coincide with other pneumonia and disease processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has published a recommendation “not to use CT for screening or as a first-line test method in the diagnosis of COVID-19”.
WHO has published several DNA tests on SARS-CoV-2, and the first of them was published on January 17.
The polymerase chain reaction in real time (RT-PCR) is tested.
It can be performed on respiratory tests and blood samples.
The results are usually ready for a period from a few hours to a few days.
Usually for the test is used a moisture from the nasopharyngeal, although it can also be used a moisture from yea. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests to identify antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, no one of them was sufficiently accurate to obtain approval for universal application.
In the U.S. the serological test, developed by Cellex, was approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
The characteristic characteristics of the visualization of symptoms on X-ray and computer tomography (CT) include asymmetric peripheral mutations according to the type of matte glass and the absence of pleural outbreaks.
The Italian Radio Society is responsible for the creation of an international database of confirmed cases of infection.
Due to the similarity with other infections, such as adenovirus, when identified COVID-19 images, not confirmed by PCR tests, have a limited clinical specificity.
In China, a large study was carried out comparing breast CT results and PCR testing, and it was found that although images are less specific in case of infection, they can be decoded faster; in addition, they are more sensitive, and therefore, this method of diagnosis can be considered as a screening tool in infected areas.
For the diagnosis of the virus using X-ray and computer tomography, artificial intelligence-based neuron networks have been developed.
Prevention strategies includeining general personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands, use with cough or chewing, which should be removed immediately after use.
Those who are already likely to have been infected should wear a medical mask in people’s places.
For the purpose of preventing the transmission of the disease, it is also recommended to physically distance from people. Many governments recommend to avoid any short-term trips to the countries and areas affected by the explosion, and restrict the movement of citizens.
However, the virus was able to spread across most regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spread among the population, some of whose members don't know where and how they were infected. Medical workers care for patients who may be infected are advised to use standard precautions as well as precautions when contacting with other people and eye protection. Contact tracking is also an important method used by healthcare bodies to determine the source of the infection and prevent its further spread.
The use by governments of locality data through their mobile phones for this purpose has caused concerns about privacy, and organizations such as Amnesty International (International Amnesty), as well as more than 100 other organizations, have made statements calling for the limitation of this type of human observation.
A variety of mobile applications have been developed and proposed for voluntary use; as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups worked on the development of solutions that safeguard the confidentiality of personal data — for example, the registration of the user’s proximity to other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.
If a mobile phone user was in close contact with a person whose COVID-19 test was positive, he receives the corresponding notification. There are also unfounded versions of how to prevent infection — for example, spraying the nose and mouth, which is actually ineffective.
Currently, the vaccine against COVID-19 does not exist, although many organizations are working on its creation.
In order to prevent the spread of the disease, hand wash is recommended.
The CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) also recommends frequently washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after visiting the toilet or with severe hand contamination, as well as before eating, after swelling, coughing or chewing.
This is necessary because, being outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which opens its protective coat.
In addition, if soap and water are not available, the CDC recommends the use of hand-processing disinfectants with alcohol content of at least 60%.
The WHO recommends that people avoid touching the eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected by a number of solutions (on the surface of stainless steel the disinfectant begins to act a minute after application) with a content of 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochloride, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7,5% povidon-yod.
Other components, such as benzalconium chloride and gluconate chlorhexidine, are less effective.
CDC recommends that, in the event of suspicion of COVID or its confirmation in an establishment, such as an office or a living station, all spaces of such room, including offices, toilets, public rooms, electronic equipment, such as tablets, sensor screens, keyboards, remote control pults and ATMs, used by sick people, are subject to disinfection.
Medical organizations recommend that you cover the mouth and nose with the back side of a lock or a handy and immediately remove the used hygiene items.
Those who may have been infected are advised to use medical masks, as the use of the mask can limit the volume and scope of the spread of the exhaling products that are spread in the air during conversation, chewing and cough.
The WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist from the University of Leeds, “the use of a medical mask can reduce the tendency of people to touch their face, and touching the face with dirty hands is the main way of infection.”
WHO recommends healthy people to wear medical masks only if they are at high risk, for example, people who take care of a person with COVID-19, although it also acknowledges that the use of the mask actually allows to reduce the number of touches to the face.
Several countries have begun to call for the use of medical masks in public places.
China has separately emphasized the importance of using one-time medical masks for healthy people, especially if they are in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
In Hong Kong, it is recommended to wear medical mask in public transportation or in public places.
Thai health officials call on people to make face tissue masks at home and wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are forbidden to go out of the street without masks covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, the Vietnamese government called on all citizens to wear masks in public places in order to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has obliged all visitors to food stores to wear medical masks.
The Israeli government also called on citizens to wear masks in public places.
On April 1, Taiwan, where 10 million medical masks are produced per day since mid-March, was prescribed to use medical masks to all passengers in trains and cross-city buses.
In Panama, the inhabitants are obliged to wear medical masks when they go out; those inhabitants who cannot buy the masks were advised to shave them on their own at home.
Medical masks are also widely used by residents of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) is an anti-infection measure aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing close contacts between people.
The protection measures include quarantine, travel restrictions, closure of schools, jobs, stadiums, theatres and shopping centers.
People can use social distancing measures by staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding popular places, using uncontact greetings and physically distant from others.
Many governments in the regions, especially those heavily affected by the explosion, are currently prescribing or recommending social distancing.
The maximum number of people that can be gathered in one place, according to the recommendations of the U.S. government agencies and health organizations, was rapidly reduced, starting from 250 people (in regions where there were no COVID-19 spread data), to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned the gathering in groups of more than two people. Elderly people and persons suffering from diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and weakened immune system are faced with an increased risk of getting a virus in a serious form. CDC recommends them to stay at home as long as possible if the region has an outbreak of the disease. At the end of March 2020, the WHO and other health authorities began to replace the use of the term "social distancing" with "physical distancing", thus clarify the objective of this measure - to reduce physical contacts within social relationships, whether through virtual communication or with physical distancing.
The use of the term "social distancing" was understood in such a way that people should be subjected to complete social isolation instead of staying in contact with other people in alternative ways. Some agencies have published guidelines for sexual health that should be used during a pandemic.
Among other things, it was recommended to have sex only with your permanent partners with whom you live and who you are sure that he has no virus and its symptoms.
People with COVID-19 diagnosis and those who suspect they are infected, self-isolation is recommended at home.
Health institutions have published detailed instructions on proper self-isolation. Governments of many countries have also imposed a mandatory procedure or recommended to the entire population of the affected areas to put themselves on a quarantine.
Persons in high-risk groups were prescribed a strict quarantine.
Persons who may have been in contact with COVID-19, or who have recently visited a country or region significantly affected by the epidemic, were recommended to be in quarantine within 14 days from the moment of the last possible contact.
Combating explosion strategies include suppressing the spread of the disease, suppressing it or mitigating it.
The prevention of the spread of the disease is carried out in the early stages and aims to track and isolate the infected and also involves other measures of infection control and vaccination in order to stop the spread of the disease among the rest of the population.
At the stage where the spread of the disease is no longer possible, the efforts are aimed at mitigating the consequences: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate the effects of the epidemic on the health system and society.
Measures to prevent and mitigate the consequences of the spread of the disease can be taken simultaneously.
Depression of the infection requires more extreme measures to turn the pandemic back by reducing the basic number of infection cases to a level below 1. Part of the efforts to manage the outbreak of the infectious disease are aimed at reducing the peak of the epidemic, known as the equalization of the epidemic curve.
Such efforts reduce the risk of overload of health services and provide more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help cope with the explosion include personal preventive measures such as hand hygiene, use of medical masks and self-isolation; public measures aimed at physical distancing such as shut down schools and abolishing mass events; attracting the community to contribute to the implementation of such measures and participation in them; as well as environmental measures such as surface cleansing. After the severity of the explosion became evident in China, there were taken more decisive actions aimed at the deterrence of the explosion, such as the isolation of entire cities and the introduction of strict travel prohibitions.
Other countries have also taken a number of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
In South Korea, mass screening and localized quarantines were introduced, and the work of the alarm system on the movements of infected persons was organized.
In Singapore, they provided financial support to infected persons in self-isolation and imposed large penalties on those who did not do so.
In Taiwan, the production of medical masks has been increased and penalized for accumulating excessive medication stocks. Modeling across the UK and the U.S. has shown that there are serious problems with regard to mitigation (the delay, but not the stop of the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (the stop of the growth of the epidemic).
The optimum policy to mitigate the effects of the disease spread could reduce the peak burden on the health system by 2/3, and the mortality rate is twice, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and collapse of the health systems.
Suppression may be a preferred method, but it should be used as long as the virus circulates among the population (or as long as the vaccine is developed, if it happens earlier), because otherwise the spread of the disease will quickly reappear when the measures will be weakened.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic leads to social and economic costs.
Antiviral drugs approved for the treatment of COVID-19, are not present at the moment, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing existing drugs.
Taking unreceptive medications for the cold, drinking enough fluid and rest can help relieve the symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, the patient may need oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid administration and breathing support.
Using steroid drugs can only hurt.
Several compounds that have previously been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are also considered to be used for the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO also that some “traditional and home remedies” could relieve the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The WHO considers the enhancement of the potential and adaptation of health care to the needs of patients with COVID-19 as the main measure to respond to the outbreak of the disease.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Regional Office of the WHO have issued guidelines for clinics and primary health care services to promote the redistribution of resources at several levels, including the concentration of laboratory services on testing on COVID-19, the abolition of short-term procedures where possible, the detection of the virus and the isolation of patients with confirmed COVID-19, as well as the expansion of the possibilities of intensive therapy by training staff and increasing the number of available IVL devices and cookies.
There are various theories about where the first case of infection could occur - the so-called "zero patient".
The first known case of new coronavirus infection was probably occurred on 1 December 2019 in the Uhan city of Hubei province, China.
Over the course of a month, the number of cases of coronavirus infection in the province of Hubei has gradually increased.
They were mainly linked to the wholesale market of seafood Huanang, which also sold live animals, and one of the theories is that the virus penetrated into the human body from one of these animals; in other words, the virus has a zoonic origin. December 26 in the Hubei province clinic was registered a case of a mass disease pneumonia of unknown origin, with which the doctor Zhang Tianjin worked, December 27 this case to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Zhang Khan in the city of Uhan.
On December 30, a group of doctors at the central clinic of the city of Uhan warned their colleagues of a “SARS-like coronavirus.”
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenyan, were warned by the police of the responsibility for the spread of false rumors, and the doctor, Ay Feng, was sentenced from their bosses for raising panic.
Later, on December 31, the Municipal Health Commission of Uhanya published a public notice and informed the WHO of the situation.
Uhani’s health authorities the number of cases of unknown pneumonia, which was large enough to initiate the investigation in early January. In the early stages of the explosion, the number of cases doubled about every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread also to other Chinese provinces, which was promoted by Chinese New Year's Holidays and the fact that Uhan is a transport and main railway nod.
On January 20, China 140 new cases of infection in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
According to later official data, by 20 January 2020 the symptoms of the disease appeared already in 6,174 people. By 26 March the United States overturned China and Italy with the largest number of confirmed cases of infection in the world. By 9 April 2020 more than 1,61 million cases of infection were recorded worldwide, more than 97,000 people died, and more than 364,000 recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have recorded at least one registered case of infection.
Due to the pandemic, many European countries in the Schengen area have restricted freedom of movement and established border controls.
National response measures included measures to prevent the spread of the disease, such as quarantine (known as compulsory home stay, compulsory home hiding or isolation), as well as commendance hours. As of April 2, about 300 million people, or about 90% of the U.S. population, were in any form of quarantine, more than 50 million people are in isolation in the Philippines, about 59 million people are in isolation in South Africa and 1.3 billion people are in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some form of isolation, and two days later this figure increased to 2.6 billion people – about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was registered in Uhan on 1 December 2019; according to another report, the reliability of the information was not verified, this date is November 17.
On December 26, Dr. Zhang Zhishan worked with the case of a mass disease with unknown type of pneumonia, which her clinic informed on December 27, the Center for the Control and Prevention of Zhishan Disease in the city of Uhan.
The preliminary genetic test of patient samples, which took place on December 27, 2019, showed the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
On 31 December, the Municipal Health Commission of Uhanya published the relevant public notice.
The WHO was notified the same day.
In connection with such notifications, the police warned the doctors in Uhan of the responsibility for "sparing rumors" about the explosion.
Initially, the Chinese National Health Commission stated that there was no “open evidence” of the ability of the newly detected virus to transmit from person to person.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign to stop the spread of the virus, which was later referred to as a “people’s war” by the Chinese Communist Party Secretary Xi Jinping.
The events of the “most large-scale quarantine in the history of mankind” began to develop, the sanitary boundary was announced on January 23 and the ban on entrance to Uhan and backwards, later this measure spread in a total of 15 cities in the Hubei province and affected a total of about 57 million people.
The city has banned the use of private transportation.
In many places, celebrations on the occasion of Chinese New Year (January 25) have been cancelled.
The authorities also announced the construction of the Hooshenshan temporary hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Later, another hospital was built, Leishenshan, which received other coming patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China also reprofiled 14 other institutions in Uhan, such as conference centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. January 26 the government adopted additional measures to prevent the COVID-19, including the issue of health reports for travelers and the extension of the Chinese New Year celebration period.
Universities and schools were closed throughout the country.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macau have introduced a number of measures, in particular, with regard to schools and universities.
In several regions of China, the authorities have introduced a remote work regime.
In the province of Hubei and beyond it, travel restrictions have been imposed.
The public transportation schedule was changed and museums throughout China were temporarily closed.
In many cities, the movement control regime was introduced, and it was estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) faced some form of open-air movement restrictions. After the explosion entered the global phase in March, China authorities took strict measures to prevent the "import" of the virus from other countries.
For example, in Beijing was introduced a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travellers entering the city. As of March 23 on the mainland of China was recorded only one case of infection transmission within the country, which occurred five days before it, in this case from a person returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang announced that the spread of cases of the disease transmitted within the country was mainly stopped and the explosion in China was taken under control.
On the same day the travel restrictions to Hubei, except Uhani, were removed, this occurred two months after the province was closed for a quarantine. March 26, 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that from March 28, entrance for persons with a visa or a residence permit will be suspended.
Those who wish to come to China will have to apply for a visa at Chinese embassy or consulates.

April 4 at 10:00 a national three-minute “minute silence” took place, which opened the day of sadness for the victims of the coronavirus, declared by the State Council of the country and coincided with the Queen’s Day, but the central government asked citizens to give respect to the victims online, following physical distancing to avoid the repeated COVID-19 explosion.
It was confirmed that COVID-19 spread to the territory of South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
On February 20, the National Ministry of Health a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases of the disease, which occurred largely due to the fact that a large number of followers of the new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shinchongji gathered in Tegu.
Shinjongji followers arrived in Tegu from Uhani, which is supposed to be the source of the explosion.
As of February 22, out of 9,336 church followers, 1,261 (approximately 13%) their presence of symptoms. February 23, 2020 in South Korea was announced the highest level of anxiety.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases of infection were registered in Korea, and on 29 February this figure increased to 3,150.
All South Korean military bases were placed on quarantine after analyses confirmed that three soldiers had the virus.
The explosion affected the number of flights, therefore, airline flights schedules were changed. South Korea has developed a population screening program on the presence of the virus, contact tracking and organizing quarantine measures for contact persons. This program is considered the largest and best in terms of its organization worldwide.
Screening methods included compulsory information about their symptoms via the mobile app to all who came from abroad, criminal testing for the virus, the results of which were ready for the next day, as well as the expansion of testing capabilities, which allowed to test up to 20,000 people daily.
The South Korean program is believed to be successful in fighting the outbreak of the disease, despite the fact that the entire cities have not begun to be isolated there. Initially, South Korean society was divided due to President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the President’s actions, or called for Mr. Mnu to give impeachment for the government’s inadequate response to the disease.

On February 19th, the Red Cross of Singapore announced that it intends to send $2.26 million aid to China.
Japan also donated one million medical masks to Uhan, Turkey sent medical equipment there, Russia - more than 13 tons of medications, Malaysia announced the donation of 18 million medical gloves, Germany sent various medical equipment including 10,000 protective sets, the United States donated 17.8 tons of medications, and also promised to allocate $100 million as a financial support to the affected countries. After the situation in China stabilized, the country also sent assistance to other countries affected by the pandemic.
In March, China, Cuba and Russia sent medications and experts to Italy to help the population cope with the coronavirus.
The businessman Jack Ma has sent to the African Union, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 1.1 million sets for testing, 6 million medical masks and 60,000 protective costumes to the organization to spread them across its countries.
He also sent 5,000 sets for testing, 100,000 medical masks and 5 IFL devices to Panama.
The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia and the Czech Republic have expressed concern about medical masks and sets for testing Chinese production.
For example, Spain withdrew 58,000 Chinese coronavirus tests, providing only 30% accuracy, and the Netherlands withdrew 600,000 missing Chinese medical masks.
Belgium also recalled 100,000 unusable medical masks: it was supposed that they were made in China, but it was later revealed that they came from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese aid was well-accepted in some parts of Latin America and Africa. on April 2, the World Bank began implementing emergency aid operations to developing countries.
The WHO has highly appreciated the efforts of the Chinese authorities to combat the epidemic and suppress the spread of the infection.
The WHO noted clear differences between the situation with the outbreak of atypical pneumonia, which occurred in 2002-2004, during which the Chinese authorities were accused of secreting information that allegedly hindered the prevention of the disease and its spread, on the one hand, and the current crisis, when the central government “regularly provided up-to-date information about the situation to avoid panic in advance of the Chinese New Year.”
On January 23, in response to the decision of the central authorities to impose a ban on transportation in Uhan, WHO spokesman Goden Galea noted that, although "this measure was definitely recommended not by WHO", it is also "a very important confirmation of the fulfilment of the commitment to preventing the epidemic in the place of the most spread", and called it "unprecedented in the history of public health." on January 30, after confirming the ability of the infection to be transmitted from person to person outside China and the increase in the number of infected in other countries, WHO announced an emergency in the public health system of international importance (PICHE); this situation has become the sixth since 2009 when such measure was first applied in the time of swine flu.
WHO Director-General Mr. Tedros Adan said the PHEIC announcement is "caused by the risk of global spread, especially in low and middle-income countries that do not have reliable healthcare systems.
Commenting on travel restrictions, Mr. Tedros said that “there is no reason for measures that excessively hinder international movement and trade,” and that “the WTO does not recommend restricting trade and movement.”
On February 5, the WHO addressed the world community with a request to allocate $675 million to ensure strategic preparation for the epidemic in low-income countries, informing the need to provide emergency assistance to those countries that “no have systems to identify people infected with the virus, despite the fact that the epidemic has not yet reached these countries.”
Mr. Tedros also said that “the indicator of our preparation is the degree of preparation for the epidemic of our weakest line,” and called on the international community “to make a choice: invest today or pay in the future.”
The same day Tedros said that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres agreed to provide “the entire UN system’s potential to respond to the problem.”
As a result, the United Nations Crisis Management Group was created to coordinate all the response measures of the United Nations; these steps, according to the WHO, will allow "to focus on health response, while other departments can use their experience to combat the outbreak in a wider social and economic scope."
On February 14, the WHO and China initiated the creation of a joint special group that provided the work of international WHO experts and staff in places in China to provide assistance in settling the situation within the country and assessing the “seriousness of the disease and its infectiousness”, organized seminars and meetings with leading national institutions, as well as visits to places to assess “the effectiveness of response measures at the level of provinces and districts, including urban and rural areas.”
On February 28, WHO officials said the probability of global coronavirus spread will be increased from "high" to "very high" - the highest level of preparation and risk.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of WHO’s Health Emergency Program, warned in a statement: “This is a check of every government on the planet’s preparation for the real situation: it’s time to act.
This virus is probably already on the way to your country, and you need to be ready,” he also stressed that the right response measures can help the world avoid “the worse scenario of developments.”
Ryan also said the current data is not the basis for the announcement of a global pandemic by officials of the public health sector, and added that the announcement of the pandemic will mean that “we in essence recognize the fact that every person on the planet will be at risk of getting infected with this virus.”
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic.
WHO’s Director-General said that WHO “is deeply concerned both the alarmingly high level of spread and severity of the disease and the not less alarming level of inaction in connection with this problem.” WHO is seriously criticized for the considered inadequate approach to the concept of pandemic, including the late public health emergency announcement and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
As a response to the current situation, the WHO Director-General, Mr. Tedros Adanoma, was submitted a petition with a proposal to resign, which was signed by 733,000 people on April 6.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts emphasized the importance of respecting the rights of every person during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group said that everyone has the right to apply to him measures that save lives, and the responsibility for organizing such measures is the government.
The group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should in no way serve as a justification for discrimination against any particular group of people.
Experts emphasized that every person has the right to health care, including people with disabilities, representatives of minority groups, elderly citizens, internally displaced persons, homeless people, citizens living in extremely poor conditions, prisoners, as well as refugees and other unidentified groups in need of state support.
International government organizations are considering the economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has created a platform designed to provide timely and comprehensive information on responsive policy measures in countries around the world, as well as to learn opinions and give recommendations.
The digital nodes contain information about the policy measures of different countries (Country Policy Tracker) to strengthen health systems and the world economy, to eliminate the consequences of quarantine and travel restrictions in order to help countries learn from each other and to promote coordinated global response measures against coronavirus.
The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, the British Cabinet Minister Michael Gow and Eduardo Bolsonaro, the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, for the action to combat the pandemic that began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
A number of leaders of the Communist Party of China (CPC) province level were dismissed for the quarantine measures they took in the central part of China, and these dismissals showed dissatisfaction with the responsive actions of the political establishment to the explosion in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this step was aimed at protecting the Secretary-General of the Communist Party of China, Xi Jinping, from public anger over the coronavirus explosion.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Liqiang, disagree with the previous statement that the coronavirus explosion began in Uhan, but took the side of the conspiracy theory that COVID-19 arose in the U.S. or Italy.
The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump called the coronavirus a “Chinese virus” or “Uhani virus”, saying that “censorship in China only worsenes the situation with the virus that has now become a global pandemic,” and this statement in turn has been criticized by some commentators who claim that such a approach is racist and “draws from the inability of the U.S. President’s administration to stop the spread of the disease.”
The Daily Beast received access to the U.S. government telegram containing the communication strategic trick apparently invented by the National Security Council; while there are the following mentions of the strategy: “It’s all about China.
Organizations such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg said China’s efforts to help countries suffering from the virus are part of the “propagandist effort” to gain global influence.
The head of the EU Foreign Policy Office, Joseph Borrell, warned of the presence of “a geopolitical component that includes the fight for influence through the pirate and the so-called policy of generosity.”
Borrell also said that “China is persistently promoting the idea of its role as a responsible and reliable partner, unlike the United States.”
China also urged the U.S. to repeal the sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while, according to some information, sending assistance to the last two countries.
Jack Ma’s donation of 100,000 medical masks to Cuba has been banned due to the U.S. sanctions imposed on April 3.
The U.S. authorities are also accused of redirecting aid intended for other countries to their own country.
About medical masks there were also disputes between other countries such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has acquired hundreds of ISL devices intended for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the lack of support from the European Union against the coronavirus covered Italy.
Mauricio Masari, Italian ambassador to the EU, said that “only China has reacted in bilateral order.
This is clearly not a sign of European solidarity.”
On March 22, after a telephone conversation with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin organized the shipping to Italy of Russian military sanitaries, specialized disinfection transport and other medical equipment.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quotes an anonymous “political source of high level” claiming that 80% of Russian aid was “unsuitable or unsuitable for Italy.”
The source accused Russia of seeking to make a favourable impression on the world’s public at a “geopolitical and diplomatic” level.
Lombardy President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio rejected the media attacks and expressed gratitude for the assistance provided.
Russia also sent a cargo aircraft with medical assistance to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, “With offering assistance to U.S. colleagues, [Putin] suggests that as U.S. manufacturers of medical equipment and materials increase their production rates, they will also be able to provide responsive assistance if necessary.”
NATO’s “Defender 2020” military exercises, planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries – NATO’s largest military exercises after the end of the Cold War – will be conducted in a shortened format.
The Secretary-General of the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign, Kate Hudson, criticized the Defender 2020 (Defender 2020) exercise: “In the crisis situation that has grown today in the field of public health, carrying out these exercises threatens not only the lives of the U.S. military and many European participating countries, but also the inhabitants of the countries where such actions should be carried out.”The Iranian government has been severely affected by the virus.
On March 14, 2020, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani in an open letter addressed the world's leaders with a request for help, reporting that his country is experiencing difficulties in combating the epidemic due to the lack of access to the international markets in connection with the U.S. sanctions imposed against Iran. The epidemic raised calls to the U.S. to adopt a social policy spread in other wealthy countries, including the implementation of a single health and child care system, paid family holidays and increased public health funding.
Political scientists expected that this could have a negative impact on Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election.
South Korea has criticized Japan’s “unseen and passive quarantine measures” after Japan has announced that any citizen arriving from South Korea will be placed for a two-week quarantine in a specificly ruled place.
South Korean society was initially divided due to President Moon Jae-in’s reaction to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the President's actions or called for Mr. Mu'n's impeachment for the government's inadequate response to the disease's outbreak. The pandemic forced the countries to adopt emergency laws as a response.
Some commentators are concerned that this step will allow governments to strengthen their powers.
In Hungary, the parliament voted for granting Prime Minister Viktor Orban the unlimited right to govern by decrees, suspend the work of the parliament, as well as to conduct elections and punish those who will be accused of spreading fake information about the virus and government measures to combat the crisis.
The coronavirus explosion has been named the cause of several cases of supply deficiency due to the global increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, the procurement of goods in panic conditions and the breakdown of production and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about the lack of medications and medical equipment, which was caused by increased consumer demand and failures in suppliers.
In several settlements there were also panic purchases; this led to a situation when food, toilet paper and bottled water disappeared from the shops, which in turn led to a shortage of stocks.
In particular, the technology industry warns of delays in the delivery of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director-General Mr. Tedros Adanom, the demand for individual protection means increased 100 times.
This jump led to a twenty-fold increase in prices compared to the usual price, as well as a four-six-month delay in the supply of medical products.
It also caused a lack of means of individual protection worldwide, and the WHO warned that health workers will be hit for this reason.
In Australia, in connection with the pandemic, buyers from the Daigo system received a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.
This activity led to child food shortage in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Uhan region, as well as the high demand for food, both areas managed to avoid acute food shortage.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the accumulation of stocks and illegal trade in critical products, which has been successful, have helped to avoid the sharp food shortage that was expected in Europe and in North America.
Northern Italy, whose agricultural production is small, has not experienced significant declines, but, according to industry representatives, the prices of agricultural products may rise.
The food stores remained empty only temporarily, even in the city of Uhan, while Chinese government officials provided access to pig stocks to provide full-fledged food to the population.
Similar laws that require food producers to preserve food stocks in the event of emergencies exist in Italy.
The damage to the world economy has affected China: according to the media data of March 16, China's economy has been severely affected in the first two months of 2020 due to the anti-virus measures adopted by the government, which resulted in a 20,5 percent decline in retail sales.
Mother China is a major economic and production center; therefore, it is believed that the virus explosion constitutes a serious destabilizing threat to the world economy.
According to the forecast, Agate Demaraj, an employee of the Economist Intelligence Unit, volatility in the markets will remain until a clearer idea of the potential outcomes appears.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic consequences of the current epidemic in terms of global growth could exceed the consequences of the 2002-2004 epidemic of atypical pneumonia.
According to one of the estimates made by an expert from the Washington University in St. Louis, the damage to the global supply chain could exceed $300 billion, and the negative impact could last up to two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has begun to take “term measures” after the sharp drop in oil prices due to a decline in demand from China.
On February 24, the global stock markets collapsed due to a significant increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19, outside the continental China.
Due to the rising concerns about the coronavirus, various U.S. stock indices, including the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Index for Industrial Companies, showed the sharpest fall since 2008, with the Dow Index falling to 1191 points, the largest one-day fall after the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
At the end of the week, all three indices showed more than a 10-percent drop.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China’s sovereign credit rating, but retained a negative forecast.
The shares fell again due to fears about the spread of the coronavirus, and the greatest fall occurred on March 16.
Many believe there is a possibility of economic recession.
The economist Mohammed El-Erian appreciated the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and states.
Central banks react faster than during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors in connection with the ban on movement, the closure of public places, including tourist attractions, and the government’s recommendations not to take any trips.
As a result of all these measures, numerous airlines canceled flights due to a sharp decline in demand for air tickets, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, and British regional airline Flybe ceased its existence.
The negative impact on the cruise line industry has been stronger than ever.
Several railway stations and ports were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chun-June, the main tourist season of Chinese New Year celebrations.
National and regional governments have canceled a number of events involving a large number of people, including annual New Year's Festivals; private companies have also closed their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many New Year's Eve events were cancelled, and tourist attractions were closed in order to prevent mass gathering of people; so, for example, the Forbidden City was closed in Beijing and traditional temple festivals were cancelled.
In 24 of China’s 31 provinces, municipalities and districts, the authorities have extended New Year’s holidays to 10 February, giving an order to most enterprises not open until this date.
These regions accounted for 80% of the country’s GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong authorities raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest and announced an emergency, closing schools until March and annulling the New Year celebration. The retail sector has been affected globally: shops were shortened and some shops were temporarily closed.
The visit to retail stations in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
Retail companies in North America and the Middle East cut sales by 50-60%.
As a result, in March, the visibility of the shopping centers fell by 33–43% compared to February.
Operators of shopping centers around the world have introduced additional measures such as improving sanitary conditions, installing equipment to check the visitors’ temperature and canceling events. According to an estimate of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, a recession in Latin America caused by a pandemic could leave 14 to 22 million more people beyond the border of poverty than it would be in a similar situation but without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the start of the Uhan epidemic, about 5 million people lost their jobs in China.
Many of the 300 million Chinese rural migrants have been home in their provinces or locked in the Hubei province.In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and asked for help to the government.
According to the estimates of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, in the United States, the coronavirus explosion could lose jobs for 47 million people, and the unemployment level could reach 32%. The self-isolation measures introduced in India will leave unemployed tens of millions of Indian migrant workers receiving daily wages. A study conducted by the Angus Reid Institute showed that 44% of Canadian households in any way encountered unemployment. Nearly 900,000 Spanish workers also lost jobs since the introduction of strict isolation in Spain in the middle of March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers submitted applications for temporary unemployment benefits, and 1 million British workers requested a single social pay. Nearly half a million companies in Germany transferred their employees to a government-subsidized reduced working schedule - part-time.
The German scheme of wages for part-time work was also introduced in France and the UK.
The spheres of art and cultural heritage have also been severely affected by a pandemic that affected the activities of organizations and individuals, whether officially employed or independent, around the world.
Organizations of culture and art have sought to support their (frequently funded) mission to ensure access to cultural heritage for society, ensuring the safety of their employees and the public, and, where possible, supporting people of art.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions were closed worldwide for an indefinite period, or access to them was differently limited, and exhibitions, events and presentations were cancelled or transferred to other dates.
Another recent and recurring consequence of the virus spread is the abolition of religious services, major sports events and other public events such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican announced the cancellation of the events of the Passion Week in Rome, which are held in the last week of the Christian Prayer period – the Great Post.
Many dioceses recommend that elderly Christians stay at home and not attend Sunday service; in some churches, church services began to be broadcast by radio, live or television, while the leaders of some churches offer to perform open-air worship.
The Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome closed for visiting its churches, clocks and St. Peter's Square, where Christian pilgrims no longer appear, and later other religious organizations also canceled worship and restricted access to public worship in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gardens.
The Ministry of Health of Iran has announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the areas affected by the coronavirus, and the saints were later closed; Saudi Arabia has banned access to foreign pilgrims and their own inhabitants to the holy places of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has led to the most significant changes in the calendar of world sports events since World War II.
Most major sports events have been cancelled or transferred, including UEFA Champions League 2019–20, Premier League 2019–20, UEFA Euro-2020, NBA 2019–20 season and NHL 2019–20 season.
The coronavirus explosion also destroyed the plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which had to start at the end of July; on 24 March, the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be "transmitted to the period after 2020 but not later than the summer of 2021." Casino and other gambling facilities around the world were closed and poker tournaments, which are usually broadcast live, were either transmitted or cancelled.
This led to the fact that many players moved to the online mode, and many gambling sites report a significant increase in the number of new subscribers. The entertainment industry also suffered as different music groups suspended or canceled concert tours.
Many major theatres, such as the Broadway, also canceled all their performances.
As an alternative to traditional offline events, some artists and musicians began to study the possibilities of continuing their activities and sharing their results on the Internet, organizing live broadcasts of online concerts or web festivals; this helps people of creative professions continue to perform, publish or publish their works.
A lot of internet memes on the coronavirus have appeared on the network, many of which are humoristic and smooth the anxious mood that is characteristic of periods of uncertainty.
Since the appearance of COVID-19, prejudice, xenophobia and racism have been worsened towards citizens of China and people of Eastern Asia, as well as representatives of the population of the hotspots of Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, Eastern Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
In February reports (when most cases of infection were still limited to China) were recorded racist emotions expressed in various groups around the world against Chinese citizens who allegedly deserved the virus or received a fair remuneration for anything.
There is also an increase in anti-China mood in some African countries.
Many inhabitants of Uhan and Hubei discrimination on a sign of their regional origin.
Citizens of China, as well as those inhabitants who live in the virus-affected areas, have been supported both offline and online.
The epidemic began to spread to new countries, in particular in Italy, the first country in Europe to face a serious COVID-19 explosion; in this context, citizens of such regions may also begin to feel the influence of suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea in the early stages signed a petition insisting on prohibiting Chinese citizens from entering their countries in order to prevent the epidemic.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan (#ChineseDo not come to Japan) occupied the leading positions on Twitter.
Chinese citizens, as well as other Asian citizens living in the United Kingdom and the United States, report a growing level of racist mood and even attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump has been criticized for calling the coronavirus a “Chinese virus”; critics consider this opinion racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign citizens evacuated from Uhan.
Students from China border northeastern India and studying in major cities in India cases of persecution related to the coronavirus explosion.
Dilip Ghosh, the president of the State Unit of the Bharatia Janat Party, West Bengal, said that the Chinese destroyed nature and "this is why God revenge them."
Later, these statements were condemned by the Chinese consulate in Calcutta, which called them a "missing."In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents again exploded due to the pandemic: foreigners began to be called "foreign waste" and objects subject to "extinction".
Many newspapers with paid access to information have removed such restrictions for some or all areas affected by the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have opened their scientific articles on the coronavirus explosion.
Some scientists have decided to give short-term access to the results of their research on preprint publishing servers such as bioRxiv.

The 2019 respiratory coronavirus (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 laboratory testing includes methods to detect the presence of the virus, and methods to detect the antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in samples is confirmed by OT-PCR, which recognizes the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is only intended to detect the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm quite recent or active infections.
Detection of antibodies (serology) can be used for both diagnostic and population control purposes.
Antibodies analyzes the number of people who suffered the disease, including those whose symptoms were too small to address them to the hospital or were absent at all.
The exact level of mortality from this disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined by the results of such a test.
As of March 2020, due to the limited possibilities of testing, there were no reliable data on the prevalence of the virus among the population in any country.
By March 23, no country managed to check more than 3% of its population, and the information about the number of tests carried out in different countries is very controversial.
Such differences in information are likely to significantly affect recorded mortality rates, which in some countries may be significantly exaggerated.
With the help of the polymerase chain reaction of real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR), the test can be carried out on respiratory samples obtained in a variety of ways, including moisture from the nasopharynx or moisture samples.
The results are usually available for a period of several hours to 2 days.
The OT-PCR test carried out on the masks taken from the throat is valid only during the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear from the throat, however, continuing to multiply in the lungs.
In infected patients tested in the second week of the disease, as an alternative can be taken material from the lower respiratory tract with the help of a disabling kateter, or can be used disabling products.
One of the early PCR tests was developed at the Charite Clinic, Berlin, in January 2020 using a polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR) and was based on 250,000 sets that were later distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
On January 28, 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a set for detection of SARS-CoV-2 based on clinical level PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It detects the gene "E", common to all beta-coronavirus, and the gene RdRp, specific to SARS-CoV-2. The Chinese company BGI Group became one of the first companies that received authorization from the National Pharmaceutical Administration of China for emergency use of the SARS-CoV-2 detection set based on PCR. In the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) spread through the International Reagent Resource their diagnostic panel for real-time RT-PCR (2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel) in public health laboratories.
One of the three genetic tests of the older versions of the test sets issued incomplete results due to the failure of the reagents and the narrow test area conducted by the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, over the course of February 2020, an average successfully processed less than 100 samples per day.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and only after that date the state and local laboratories were allowed to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Quality Supervision Authority within the framework of an emergency application permission. U.S. Commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the possibility of testing for COVID-19 infection based on RT-PCR throughout the country.
Quest Diagnostics has started testing on COVID-19 throughout the country since March 9, 2020.
No quantitative restrictions were; the collection and processing of the tests must be carried out in accordance with the CDC requirements.
In Russia, the test on COVID-19 was developed and produced by the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology "VECTOR".
It was that on March 12, 2020 the Mayo Clinic developed a test to detect COVID-19. on March 13, 2020 Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for the use of the test, which can be carried out within 3.5 hours on a large amount of samples, allowing one machine to process approximately 4128 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency application permit (EUA) to Abbott laboratories for testing the Abbott m2000 system; earlier, the FDA issued a similar permit to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid will also receive EUA from the FDA for a test of approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA has also approved a test in which PCR instead of isothermic nucleic acid amplification technology is used.
Since this test does not require a series of fluctuating temperatures cycles, this method can detect positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently there are about 18,000 such machines in the United States, and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests per day. Currently, a test is being developed in Taiwan using a monoclonal antibody that is specifically linked to the nucleocapside protein (N-protein) of the new coronavirus, and there is hope of the possibility of obtaining results in 15-20 minutes, similar to an express flu test.
The review of specialized literature for March 2020 concludes that “brust röntgen graphs have a small diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT [computer tomography] results may have such value even before symptoms appear.”
The typical signs that are detected during CT include bilateral multi-dollar subplural folding focuses of the type of "mato glass" with peripheral, asymmetric and apostherial distribution.
Subplural domination, the symptom of the calcium bridge and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
The results of a study comparing the PCR and CT methods used in Uhan at the time of the current pandemic occurrence showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, as many of its visualization functions coincide with other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has published a recommendation “not to use CT for screening or as a first-line test method in the diagnosis of COVID-19”.
Partly, the immune response to the infection is expressed in the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infection in humans after the 7th day of the presence of symptoms, to determine immunity and for the purpose of performing population control.
In many clinical laboratories, these tests will be able to perform high-performance automated systems, but their availability will depend on the speed of production of each such system.
CLT usually uses one peripheral blood sample, although serial samples can also be used to track the immune response.
With PoCT, one sample of blood is usually obtained through the skin cover.
Unlike PCR methods, the blood test phase is not required to take a test test. March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 organizations that have passed all the necessary registration procedures and are now able to spread their antibodies tests.
At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European permits to use their test sets that can detect in blood samples of IgG and IgA antibodies capable of fighting the virus.
The test productivity is several hundred samples for several hours and therefore this method works much faster than the usual PCR analysis of the viral RNA.
The antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after infection.At the beginning of April, the UK found that none of the antibodies she acquired for the analysis of the antibodies gave satisfactory results.
In Hong Kong, a scheme has been developed to allow suspicious patients to stay at home: “Emergency staff send the patient a sample sample,” the patient blows in it, gives back and after a while receives the test results. The British NHS has announced the launch of its pilot scheme for testing suspicious cases at home, which eliminates the risk of infection by the patient by other clinic visitors, or the need to disinfect the emergency machine if it was used to carry the patient. During the express test on COVID-19 in suspicious cases, the medical staff takes the analysis using all appropriate precautions.
Express testing centers helped South Korea organize one of the fastest and most extensive testing procedures than in any other country. on 2 March in Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Medical Insurance Doctors said it was ready to carry out about 12,000 tests a day in ambulatory conditions, and weeks earlier they could do only 10,700 tests a week.
If the examination is prescribed by a doctor, the costs are covered by medical insurance.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany’s total test performance is 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, it was proposed to conduct express testing in several major cities.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of tests submitted in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were recorded.
The first laboratory study showed that according to the calendar week 12/2020 on SARS-CoV-2 was taken in a total of at least 483 295 tests, up to the week 12/2020, including, and at 33 491 samples (6.9%) the result was positive. The researchers of the Israeli clinics Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested the method of simultaneous testing of samples taken in 64 patients, combining samples and conducting further tests only if the combined sample shows a positive result. In Uhan, February 5, 2020, the company BGI opened a temporary laboratory of a area of 2000 square meters for the detection of the usual cases under the name of "Hun-Yah" (O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O
The construction of this laboratory was organized by the founder of BGI Van Jiang and completed in just 5 days; the modeling showed that if this laboratory had not been launched at such an accelerated rate, the cases of the disease in Hubei would be 47% higher, and accordingly, the cost of the quarantine would also be twice higher.
After the opening of the laboratory in Uhan, the Ho-Yang laboratories were immediately opened in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai — in a total of 12 cities in China.
By March 4, 2020, the daily total capacity indicators were 50,000 tests per day. Open multiplex Origami Assays schemes were released, which can test up to 1,122 tests of patients on COVID19 using only 93 screws. Such balanced structures can work in small laboratories, excluding the need to use robotic liquid manipulators.
By March, due to the lack and insufficient number of reagents, a mass testing in the EU, the UK and the U.S. became problematic.
As a result, some authors appealed to the test samples processing protocols that provide for the heating of samples at 98°C (208°F) for 5 minutes in order to release DNA genoms for further testing. March 31 was announced that the volume of coronavirus testing that the United Arab Emirates performs per capita currently exceeds the indicators of any other country, and soon the majority of the population will be tested.
This occurred thanks to the possibilities of conducting express testing, along with the acquisition from Group 42 and BGI of a mass testing laboratory (created on the basis of their laboratory for detection of Hu-Yang emergencies in China).
This laboratory, developed in 14 days, is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests a day and is the world’s first so large laboratory operating outside China.
Different test options aimed at different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German version of testing sets that are sent to low-income countries that do not have resources to develop their own sets.
The German version was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. sanitary and epidemiological centers was unavailable until January 28, leading to the lack of test sets in the U.S. At the very beginning of the explosion in China and the U.S. there were problems with the reliability of test sets, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide the sufficient number of sets recommended by health experts.
But in South Korea, as experts say, the wide availability of testing has helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
For several years, the South Korean government has been working on providing opportunities for testing, mostly in private laboratories.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called on to increase the development of testing programs as the best way to slow down the spread of the COVID-19. As a result of the increased demand for testing caused by the rapid spread of the virus, many US private laboratories, which received hundreds of thousands of samples of tests, were overloaded, and the stock of materials for the collection of masks and chemical reagents quickly exhausted.
In March 2020, China problems with the accuracy of its test sets.
The U.S. test sets developed by the CDC had “disadvantages” and for this reason the government eliminated the bureaucratic barriers that interfered with the private test development. Spain acquired the test sets from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results of the use of these sets were inaccurate.
The company explained that the cause of inaccurate results may be a failed sampling of samples or the misuse of samples.
The Spanish ministry said it will revoke the sets that give incorrect results and replace them with other sets – Shenzhen Bioeasy sets. 80% of the test sets that the Czech Republic acquired in China gave incorrect results. 1.2 million test sets acquired by Slovakia in China were also recognized as incorrect.
Atesh Kara, an employee of the Ministry of Health of Turkey, claimed that the test sets purchased in China had a "high level of errors" and the Ministry "not started to use them."The UK purchased 3.5 million test sets in China, but at the beginning of April 2020 it was announced that these sets were unsuitable for use.
Carantine measures for people whose tests gave a positive result on SARS-CoV-2, as well as observation of people with whom such patients were in contact, had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, where for the first time in Italy a person died from COVID-19, conducted two cycles of testing of the total population of approximately 3,400 people, with an interval of about ten days.
About half of people with a positive result had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed cases of the disease were placed on a quarantine.
The entrance to the territory of the settlement was closed, and this measure completely stopped the spread of the infection.
Under the conditions of intensive tracking of contacts, entrance restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, the coronavirus pandemic of 2020 in Singapore was much less stressful than in other developed countries, and there was no need to impose such extreme restrictions as the forced closure of restaurants and stores.
Many events there were cancelled, and on March 28, Singapore began to strongly advise residents to stay at home, but schools, the holidays in which ended on March 23, opened on schedule.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, also dealt with the pandemic due to intensive contact tracking, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, but restrictions in them were less aggressive.
A statistical study showed that in countries where more tests were conducted compared to the number of deaths, the mortality rate was much lower, probably because these countries were able to identify more patients with slightly expressed symptoms or lack of symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratories with limited experience working with COVID-19, send their first five positive and first ten negative results of COVID-19 tests to one of WHO’s 16 control laboratories for confirming testing.
Seven of these 16 control laboratories are located in Asia, five in Europe, two in Africa, one in North America and one in Australia.
On the following chart, the "% positive results" column indicators depend on the test policy adopted in a specific country.
The country in which only hospitalized patients are tested will have a higher positive result in percentages compared to the country in which all citizens are tested, regardless of the presence of the symptoms of the virus, under other equal conditions.
Hand washing, also known as “hand hygiene” is a process of cleaning the hands in order to remove pollution, fat, microorganisms or other harmful substances.
Regular washing hands with soap at certain “critical moments” during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by the fecal oral.
A person can also become infected with respiratory diseases such as flu or common colds, for example, if he touches the eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. the mucous membranes) with unwashed hands.
Five critical moments during the day, after which you should wash your hands with soap: before and after the defecation, after the washing of the baby's frogs or the change of the frogs, before the child's feeding, before the meal, and before and after the cooking of food or the processing of raw meat, fish and bird.
If water and soap are unavailable, your hands can be cleaned with salt. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands:
Before, during and after cooking.
Before and after the treatment of the sick.
After changing the clothes or washing the child going to the toilet.
After swelling, cough or coughing.
After touching animals, feed or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygienic actions associated with medical procedures.
Washing hands before taking medications or medical procedures will prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of handwashing is to clean hands from pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause diseases), as well as from chemicals that may be harmful or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is especially important for people who are engaged in cooking or working in the medical sector, but it is also important for all other people.
Washing hands is very beneficial for health: for example, it minimizes the spread of flu, coronavirus and other infectious diseases, prevents infectious types of diarrhea, reduces the spread of respiratory infections.
It also reduces infant mortality during domestic births.
A 2013 study found that better hand washing could lead to a slight acceleration of growth in children under the age of five.
In developing countries, child mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhea diseases can be reduced by absorbing simple habits, such as washing hands with soap.
This elementary procedure can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by 50%.
Regular reminders of the benefits of handwashing can reduce the number of cases of diarrhea by about a third, and this is comparable to the benefits of providing regions with low net water income.
Reducing the number of cases of diarrhea by 48% can be associated with handwashing with soap. Handwashing with soap is the only most effective and cheap way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory diseases (ADDs) provided that appropriate habits are developed in every home, school and other public places around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the main complications of ORI, is the main cause of death among children under the age of five, which causes the lives of approximately 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia kills almost 3.5 million children each year.
The United Nations Children’s Fund reports that washing hands with soap before meals and after the toilet, which has become a solid habit, can save more lives than any separate vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce the mortality from diarrhea almost twice, and the mortality from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitary activities under water supply, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Washing the hands also prevents the occurrence of impettigo – a disease that is transmitted with direct physical contact.
A small negative consequence of frequent hand washing is that it can lead to drying of the skin and, consequently, to its damage.
A Danish study of 2012 found that too frequent hand washing could lead to suddenness and skin swelling – a disease known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is common among health workers.
Too frequent washing of hands can also be considered one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCR).
There are five so-called “critical moments” during the day when handwashing with soap is important to reduce the risk of fecal or oral transmission of the disease: after emptying (urineation, defecation), after washing the baby’s bacteria (changing the bacteria), before feeding the child, before eating and before/after cooking or processing raw meat, fish or bird.
Some other cases when you should wash your hands in order to prevent the transmission of the disease: before or after the processing of a cut or wound, after choking, cough or swelling, after touching animal or animal waste, after touching waste.
In many countries, the hand washing procedure with soap is quite uncommon.
A study on handwashing, which was conducted in 2015 in 54 countries, showed that an average for 38.7% of families handwashing with soap is a common practice. The 2014 study showed that the highest indicator, 97%, was recorded in Saudi Arabia; the U.S. on this list is closer to the middle, their indicator is 77%; the lowest indicator was recorded in China - 23%. Currently there are several methodologies of behavior change and developing habits of handwashing with soap in critical situations.
The Emergency Medical Care Program, implemented by the Ministry of Education of the Philippines, is an example of large-scale measures to strengthen children’s health and improve the level of education of children.
The basis of this national program is degelmination, which is carried out twice a year, as well as daily handwashing with soap and daily tooth cleaning with fluoride.
The same program is successfully carried out in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin is more effective if the process of washing is added to soap or washing agents.
The main effect of soap and laundry is to eliminate barriers to solubility and increase its level.
Water itself is not considered an effective remedy for cleaning the skin, as fats and proteins, which are components of organic pollution, are poorly dissolved in water.
A sufficient amount of water, however, contributes to the cleaning process.
Hard soap, due to multiple use, may also contain bacteria that may get on it when previously used.
A small number of studies dedicated to getting bacteria into the skin cover from a polluted piece of solid soap indicates a low probability of such a hit as bacteria are washed with a pen.
The CCC still claims that “flat soap with a manual doser is the preferred option for handwashing.”
Antibacterial soap is actively advertised in communities careful for its health.
Today, there is no evidence that the use of the recommended antiseptic or disinfectants has a selective effect on organisms that are resistant to antibiotics in their own nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, to which many resistant spaces of organisms are resistant.
Thus, even if antibiotic-resistant stams are not selectively against antibacterial soap, their effectiveness may not match the advertised.
In addition to surface-active substance and skin protection, complex compounds may contain acids (acid, ascorbic, milk) as a pH regulator, as well as antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other breathes (aloe vera, vitamins, mentol, plant extracts). The comprehensive analysis conducted by the School of Public Health of the University of Oregon showed that in terms of the prevention of diseases and the removal of bacteria from the skin of the hands, simple varieties of soap are as effective as the usual antibacterial soap containing triclosan.
Hot water comfortable for human skin temperature is still not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria reproduce much faster at a body temperature of 37°C.
However, to remove natural fats that hold pollution and bacteria, hot soap water is more effective than cold.
Contrary to the common opinion, research has shown that the use of warm water does not affect the reduction of microbial load on the hands.
A hand disinfectant (sanitizer) or a hand antiseptic is a hand hygiene tool that does not contain water.
At the end of the 1990s and in the early 21st century the popularity of alcohol-based hand hygiene means that do not contain water (also known as alcohol-based hand disinfectants, antiseptic hand disinfectants or sanitaires) began to gain popularity.
Most of these products are made on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol with the addition of drillers such as a carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in the form of a gel, or moisturizers such as glycerin in liquid or pen form, providing the convenience of using these products and reducing the effect of drying the skin with alcohol.
Adding solved hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity. Desinfectants containing at least 60-95% of alcohol effectively destroy microbes.
Alcohol-based disinfectants kill bacteria, including multiple drug resistance bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis palm, as well as some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, flu and hepatitis) and fungi.
Desinfectants containing 70% of alcohol kill 99.97% of bacteria (logarithm of reduction 3.5 similar to a reduction of 35 decibels) on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% – 99.999% of bacteria (logarithm of reduction 4–5) on the hands 1 minute after application.
Alcohol-based disinfectants are practically ineffective against the norovirus (or Norwalk) type viruses, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. It is necessary to use a sufficient amount of antiseptic or alcohol container to carefully treat and feed the skin of the hands on both sides.
The face and back surface of both hands, as well as the space between the fingers throughout the length, are stretched for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, pen or gel is completely absorbed.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends making choices in favour of hand washing rather than using disinfectants, especially if the hands are severely contaminated.
The increased popularity of such disinfectants is due to the simplicity of their use and the rapid destruction of microorganisms, but they should not serve as a replacement for full hand washing if there is the possibility of using water and soap.
Frequent use of hand disinfectants on the basis of alcohol can cause skin dryness if their composition does not contain humidifier and/or skin humidifier.
The effect of drying the skin with alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and (or) other relievers to the ingredient.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand disinfectants containing moisturizing components caused significantly less irritation and dry skin than soap or antimicrobial washers.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact scratch syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in disinfectants, practically do not occur.
The lower probability of irritating contact dermatitis has become a factor in favor of the choice of disinfectants compared to soap and water.
Despite its effectiveness, the means that do not contain water do not clean hands from organic substances, but simply disinfect them.
This is why hand disinfectants are not so effective in preventing the spread of many pathogenic microorganisms, such as ordinary soap and water, as when using such means, pathogenic microorganisms still remain on their hands.
The effectiveness of the non-alcoholic hand disinfectant depends significantly on the components and composition, and has historically been significantly lower than in alcohol or alcohol-containing drugs.
Recently, it has been proven that the drugs that use benzalconium chloride have a stable and cumulative antimicrobial activity, unlike alcohol, which has been proven to lose its effectiveness after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin side effects.
Many people in low-income communities can’t afford to use soap and replace it with gold or garlic.
Salt or garlic may be more effective than just water, but they will always be less effective than soap.
One problem with this method is that if garlic or salt is contaminated by microorganisms, it can, on the contrary, increase the spread of the disease.
Like soap, soil is a disinfectant, as when in contact with water it forms a alkaline solution.
If soap is not available, the WHO recommends to use soap or sand as an alternative.
To prevent infection, the Centers for Disease Control in the U.S. recommend using a handwashing technique, which includes the following stages:
Wash your hands under warm or cold water.
It is recommended that flowing water, because standing water can be contaminated, but the temperature of the water does not matter.
Wash your hands by stretching them with a lot of soap, including the back side of your arms, as well as the area between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes microbes from the skin, and research shows that when using soap (not just one water) people tend to wash their hands more carefully.
Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds.
Treating helps to remove microbes from the skin, and the longer you throw your hands, the more microbes are removed.
Wash your hands carefully under water.
Washing your hands in standing water can cause reinfection.
Wash your hands with a clean towel or let them dry on your own.
The moist and wet hands are more easily contaminated. Most often, people ignore areas such as the big finger, wrist, the area between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and shocked nail lak can contain a lot of microorganisms.
It is often recommended to use moisturizing lotion to prevent drying of the skin of the hands, which can cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If flowing water and soap are not available, there are a lot of different cheap ways to wash your hands: throwing water from a hanging canister or bottle tail with made holes and (or) using salt if necessary, as is, for example, in developing countries. In places with limited water supply (for example, in schools or rural areas in developing countries) there are water-saving solutions, such as foot pedal cracks and other cheap options.
Cran with a foot pedal is a simple structure consisting of a container hanged on the wire, and a foot wire, which should be pressed so that water lies on the hands; at the same time, a piece of soap should be used.
Effective hand drying is an integral part of the hand hygiene process, but there are some disputes about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
The growing volume of research shows that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers that are installed in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the Westminster University in London, sponsored by the European Symposium on the manufacture of paper towels and towels; the subject of this study was the comparison of the level of hygiene of paper towels, hand dryers with warm air and more modern flow air dryers for hands.
It was found that after washing and drying the hands in a hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria on the fingers in average increases by 194%, and on the hands - by 254%.
It was also found that after washing and drying the hands in the air-flow dryer, the total number of bacteria on the fingers increases by 42%, and on the hands - by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on the fingers in average decreases to 76%, and on the hands - to 77%.
The electric air dryer, which produces air at declared speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 miles/h), is able to sweat microorganisms from the hands and from its own block and potentially infect other users of the toilet and the sandwich in a radius of up to 2 meters.
The use of dryers for hands with warm air spreads microorganisms in a radius of up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
In 2005, TÜV Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study on the assessment of various methods of hand drying.
The following changes in the number of bacteria are observed depending on the method of hand drying:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers are compared to drying paper towels.
Hand cleansing with disinfecting wipes can be an alternative solution during travel in the absence of soap and water.
The alcohol-based hand desinfectant must contain at least 60% of alcohol.
The medical method of handwashing became mandatory long after the Hungarian doctor Ignatz Zemmelweiss discovered its high effectiveness (in 1846) in the prevention of diseases in hospital conditions.
There are electronic devices that remind hospitals employees of the need to wash their hands if they forget about it.
According to one study, the use of such devices actually helps to reduce the level of infection.
The medical handwashing lasts at least 15 seconds, with a large amount of soap, water or gel used to wash and stretch each part of the hands.
The hands should be carefully stretched over each other, crossing the fingers.
If there is dirt under the nails, you can use a brush to remove it.
Since the microbes can remain in the water present on the hands, it is important to wash them well and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying the hands, closing the crane, as well as, if necessary, closing and opening any doors, you should use a paper towel.
This helps to avoid re-contamination of the hands from these surfaces.
The purpose of handwashing in medical facilities is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (“microbes”) and prevent their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the hand washing procedure remains unacceptable in most medical institutions: a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before they touch the patients, and thus spread microorganisms.
According to the results of one study, proper handwashing and other elementary procedures can reduce the level of blood flow infections associated with the use of a catheter by 66%.The World Health Organization has published a list with an image of the standard handwashing and treatment procedure that should be applied in the health sector.
The WHO Hand Hygiene Guidelines Project is also available on its website and open to public discussion.
The corresponding review was conducted by Whitby in the co-authorship.
If confirmation of compliance with the regulatory requirements is required, commercial devices can be used to measure the indicators and check the hygiene of the hands.
The World Health Organization describes the “five moments” when you need to wash your hands:
after contact with blood or biological fluids,
before the use of antiseptic, as well as
Adding antiseptic chemicals to the soap when washing hands (“medical” or “antimicrobial” soap) helps to destroy bacteria.
Such antibacterial properties may be necessary before surgery or in an environment with a high content of antibiotic-resistant organisms. To “clean” the hands before surgery, a cran is required, which can be enabled and turned off without touching its hands; you should also use a little chlorhexidine or iodine water to wash your hands, sterile handbags to dry your hands after washing, a sterile brush to throw and another sterile tool to clean under your nails.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires the washing of the hands and forearms to the lock usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
No need to stretch your hands for too long, for example, 10 minutes.
During the washing, the water from the front should not come back to the chest of the hands.
After the washing is completed, the hands are dried with the sterile tissue and wear a surgical dress.
To reduce the spread of microbes, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after the treatment of a sick person.
To fight staphylococcus infections in hospitals it was found that the greatest benefit from handwashing was given by the first 20% washing, and that very little additional benefits were obtained when the frequency of handwashing was increased by more than 35%.
Compared to antibacterial soap, handwashing with ordinary soap leads to more than three times the frequency of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted through food. Comparing handwashing with alcohol-containing solution and handwashing with antibacterial soap, an average of 30 seconds per procedure, showed that handwashing with alcohol-containing solution reduced bacterial pollution by 26% compared to antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are still more effective than alcoholic solutions for hands, in terms of reducing the number on the hands of the influenza virus A H1N1 and the clostridium diffhile dispute. Hand hygiene development activities in medical institutions may include training staff by washing hands, increasing the availability of alcoholic solutions for hands, as well as written and oral reminders to staff about the need to wash hands.
Additional research is needed on the most effective types of measures in different medical institutions.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is recognized as a economically effective and important means for improving health and even digestion.
However, the absence of stable water supply, soap or handwashing in homes, schools and workplaces makes it difficult to get the habit of regularly washing hands.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, not every private or public toilet has handwashes, although there are also cheap ways to organize handwashes in such places.
However, insufficient hand hygiene can also be caused by rooted habits, not the lack of soap or water.
Propaganda and stimulation of handwashing with soap can affect political decisions, increase awareness of the benefits of handwashing and lead to long-term changes in the behavior of the population.
To ensure the effectiveness of such measures, monitoring and evaluation of the results must be carried out.
A systematic analysis of 70 studies found that to improve the situation with hand hygiene in countries with income below the average level efficient sanitary and epidemiological supervision at community level, while public marketing campaigns are less efficient. One example of propaganda about handwashing in schools is the approach of the United Nations Children's Foundation "Three Star Approach": it promotes the implementation in schools of simple economic measures that stimulate handwashing by students using soap, as well as the fulfilment of other hygiene requirements.
By ensuring compliance with the minimum standards, schools can raise their level from one to three stars.
The installation of handmates is one of the possible measures implemented within the framework of information campaigns on hand hygiene in order to reduce the level of disease and child mortality.
The World Hand Washing Day is another example of an informational campaign aimed at changing behavior. As a result of the coronavirus pandemic 2019-20 years, the United Nations Children's Fund promotes the use of emoji symbolizing hand washing.
Some studies looked at the overall effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries in comparison with the DALYs (sustained years of life without disability).
However, one study suggests that stimulating handwashing with soap is a much more economical solution compared to other sanitary measures.
The importance of handwashing for human health – especially for vulnerable categories of people, such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals – was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two hand hygiene innovators: the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna (Austria), and Florence Nightingale, an English nurses and the “founder of modern patient care.”
At that time, most people still believed that the infections were caused by dirty odors called myasms.
In the 1980s, due to the outbreaks of diseases that spread through the digestive tract and infections associated with medical care, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. became more actively promoting hand hygiene as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.
As a result of the 2009 swine flu outbreak and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have become better aware of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect the body from such infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, in the public toilets, as well as in the toilets of the office buildings and airports, posters with “the right handwashing techniques” were wrapped.
The phrase “washing your hands” means a manifestation of your refusal to take responsibility for something or be a part of something.
It comes from the Bible, the Gospel of Matthew: Pontius Pilate “washed his hands” when he made a decision about the crucifixion of Jesus Christ; later this phrase gained wider use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's "McBet" play, Lady McBet begins to unintentionally wash her hands in an attempt to clean up from the imaginary spot that symbolizes an unclean conscience, in connection with the crimes she committed herself and encouraged her husband to commit.
It was also found that people who remembered or observed any unethical behavior tend to wash hands more often than other people, and for them handmates are more important.
Also, it is less likely that people who had the opportunity to wash their hands after they were seen will participate in any other “cleaning” compensatory activities, such as voluntary activities.
Symbolic handwashing with water, but without soap, is part of the ritual provided in many religions, including Bahá'u'lláh, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe hygienic handwashing, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam prescribe mandatory handwashing after visiting the toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam, handwashing is considered necessary before and after each meal.
Control of production factors in connection with COVID-19
Control of production factors in connection with COVID-19 involves the application of work safety and health care methods to control the risk and combat the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
The proper risk control at work depends on the place and work task, is based on the risk assessment, the severity of the epidemic situation in the community and the risk factors for individual workers that may be vulnerable in connection with COVID-19.
The U.S. Department of Occupational Safety and Industrial Hygiene (OSHA) that low-risk positions have minimal professional contacts with the public and colleagues, and such cases require basic measures to combat infection, including washing hands, encouraging workers to stay at home with signs of disease, keeping the respiratory label, and carrying out daily cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Medium-risk duties require frequent or close contacts with people who do not have a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19, but there is a probability of infection due to the current spread of the disease in society or during international trips.
This category may include workers who are in contact with the public, for example, in schools, a high-density workplace and in some major retail stores.
Risk control measures for such a group, in addition to basic measures for the prevention of infection, include ventilation using highly efficient air filters, the use of protective screens and available personal protection in case of contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
OSHA believes that employees of medical institutions and morga who have contacted a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 infection are high-risk categories; while the risk rate increases to very high when such employees carry out procedures accompanying aerosol formation, or collecting/processing samples from a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19.
Risk control measures suitable for such employees include the use of engineering and technical safety equipment, such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and personal protection equipment suitable for the relevant task.
The COVID-19 explosion can have various types of exposure at work.
Workers may be missing at work due to their own illness, the need to take care of others or the fear of possible infection.
Commercial patterns may vary both with regard to the types of goods for which there is a demand and the ways of purchasing such goods (e.g., making purchases in non-pique periods with delivery or service without leaving the machine).
Finally, it is possible to interfere with the delivery of goods from the geographical regions affected by COVID-19.
The plans address issues related to different workplaces and tasks, including sources of infection, risk factors that arise at home and in communities, and risk factors for individual workers, such as the elderly age or the presence of chronic diseases.
The plans also indicate the means of control necessary to solve problems with such risks, as well as plans of emergency measures for situations that may arise as a result of the epidemic.
Plans for preparation and response to the epidemic may be subject to national or state recommendations.
Some of the objectives to ensure response to the epidemic are: reducing the spread of the virus among staff, protecting people at higher risk of serious health complications,ining business operations and minimizing the negative consequences for other organizations in their supply chains.
The response measures are affected by the severity of diseases in the community where the business is located.
The hierarchy of risk control means is a structure widely used in ensuring safety and work hygiene, to group such means depending on efficiency.
If it is impossible to eliminate the risk of the disease COVID-19 the most effective engineering and technical means of safety, then the administrative measures and, finally, the means of personal protection.
Safety engineering means isolating employees from work-related risks and do not rely on the employee’s behavior, which can be the most economically profitable solution.
Administrative measures involve changes in work policies or procedures that require action from the employee or employee.
Personal protection funds (PPEs) are considered less efficient than engineering, technical or administrative measures, but may help eliminate certain risks.
All types of personal protection means should be selected depending on the threat to the employee, suited by size (e.g., respirators), used continuously and properly, checked regularly,ined in proper condition and replaced as necessary, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or used to avoid infection.
The U.S. Department of Labor Safety and Industrial Hygiene (OSHA) believes that the lowest-risk positions have minimal contact with the public and their colleagues.
Basic measures to combat the epidemic recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough handwashing, recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, compliance with respiratory labels, including hand-covering in case of cough and chewing, supplies with rubber and containers for waste, preparation for remote or replacement work, if necessary, recommendations for workers to avoid using other tools and equipment, as well as carrying out daily cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Fast identification and isolation of persons potentially infected is a critical step to protect employees, customers, visitors and other persons at work.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory diseases stay at home until the end of the heat, the absence of high body temperature and many other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of fever antidepressants or other symptoms removing drugs, as well as prescribes to ensure the flexibility of the policies on the hospital lists, allow employees to stay at home to care for the sick family member and ensure employees are aware of such policies.
According to OSHA, middle-risk positions require frequent and close contacts at a distance of no more than six feet (1,8 m) with people for whom there is no confirmed data or suspicion of COVID-19 infection, but there is a probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection as a result of the spread of the disease in the society in the area where the business is located, or as a result of recent travels of such person to the COVID-19.
These categories include workers who have been in contact with the public, for example, in schools, a high-density workplace and some large retail stores. Administrative measures for such a group and a higher-risk group include recommendations for patients to stay at home, to replace personal meetings for communications with virtual means, to install graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics with graphics
In rare cases, workers from this risk group may need to wear respiratory devices.
If a person is sick in the aircraft, then to ensure the adequate safety of workers and other passengers, such measures are required as isolating the sick person from other people at a distance of 6 feet, appointing any crew member to take care of the sick person, giving the sick a mask or addressing that person with a request to cover the nose and mouth with a handy in case of cough or coughing.
Secondary crew members should wear one-time medical gloves when they approach the patient or when they are in contact with physiological fluids or potentially infected surfaces and, possibly, additional personal protection if the patient has heat, regular cough or breathing difficulties.
Used gloves and other one-time items should be placed in a biologically safe bag, and infected surfaces should then be cleaned and disinfected. In cases of commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, safety measures include delaying the trip in case of illness, self-isolation and immediate information to the medical center on the ship in the presence of heat or other symptoms in anyone on board.
In the case of schools and child care institutions, the CDC recommends short-term closure for cleaning or disinfection if the infected person was in the school building, regardless of the prevalence of the disease in the community.
In the presence of a minimum or medium level of infection spread in the community, social distancing strategies may be implemented, for example, the cancellation of departure for personal meetings, meetings and other mass events, such as fitness or fun singing, eating in cafés, increasing the distance between parties, regulating time of arrival and care, limiting unimportant visits, the use of a separate location of health care facilities for children with flu symptoms.
With significant rates of spread in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, measures for long-term non-visit of school can be considered. For law enforcement employees performing daily duties, the direct health risk is considered low, according to the CDC.
The law enforcement staff responsible for contacting persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 infection is recommended to follow the same instructions that are prescribed to emergency fields, including the use of appropriate means of personal protection.
In the event of close contact during the detention, workers must clean and disinfect their shaped belt and equipment before re-use by means of household cleansing aerosols or by stretching, follow the standard operational procedures to prevent the spread of the disease and the recycling of the used personal protection means, as well as the use and washing of clothes.
OSHA believes that some categories of healthcare workers and drug workers are at high or very high risk.
High-risk positions include medical care, support, laboratory and medical transport staff contacting patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
They have a very high risk of infection when they carry out procedures accompanied by aerosol formation, or when collecting/processing samples from persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
Procedures accompanied by the formation of aerosol include sonding, procedures that cause cough, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examination or sampling of samples by invasive methods.
High-risk workers include employees who treat the bodies of people with a confirmed disease or suspicion of COVID-19 infection at the time of their death; if such employees carry out disclosure, they go into a very high-risk category. Additional engineering and technical safety tools for such risk groups include the use of isolated rooms for patients with a confirmed disease or suspicion of COVID-19, including during the conduct of procedures accompanied by the formation of aerosol.
In some healthcare facilities, the use of special ventilation with negative pressure can be an effective measure.
The samples should be treated in accordance with the precautions provided for for the level of biological safety.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends to allocate entering patients into distinct waiting zones depending on the presence of suspicion of COVID-19.In addition to other personal protection means, OSHA recommends the use of respirator workers interacting at a distance of up to 6 feet with patients with confirmed disease or suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as persons carrying out procedures accompanied by aerosol formation.
In the U.S. approved NIOSH respiratory devices for people with a N95 or higher filter should be used as part of a comprehensive written respiratory protection program that specifies the requirements for individual selection of equipment and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide more efficient protection and comfort for the employee. WHO does not recommend using species because COVID-19 is a disease that is transmitted by the respiratory system rather than by physiological fluids.
WHO recommends using only surgical masks for staff performing screening at the patient reception point.
People who collect samples from the respiratory tract in patients with COVID-19 or carriers of this disease without procedures accompanied by the formation of aerosols, the WHO recommends to wear a surgical mask, protective glasses or a protective screen for the face, dresses and gloves.
When performing procedures accompanied by the formation of aerosol, instead of a surgical mask should be wearing a respirator N95 or FFP2.
Given the lack of individual protection resources around the world, the WHO recommends to minimize the need for such protections by using the possibilities of remote medicine, physical barriers, such as transparent eyelids, providing access to the patient infected with COVID-19, only those persons providing immediate care, the use of only those personal protection resources that are necessary for a specific task, the prolonged use of the same respirator, without removing, while working with several patients with the same diagnoses, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of personal protection resources and recommends not to use masks for persons without symptoms.

Date/Time of Delivery: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
Authorization: CC0: No protected rights
This month we live in unusual circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that shed light on the interconnection of people around the world and our responsibility to each other.
We had no precedents of such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our measures depends on the ability to sympathy, cooperate and develop communities around the world, which is the foundation of such an organization.
We observed friendly and careful relationships between all of our colleagues, which was reflected in emails, calls and chats – a remarkable confirmation of the fact that, fortunately, amazing people work with us.
I am very grateful and proud to talk about you as my colleagues.
Last week I was informed of the high appreciation of our work.
I was reminded of how important it is for the world to contact Wikipedia right now, and how useful it is for every person to have online access to this key resource.
And this is possible thanks to your work, whether it is to ensure the performance of the sites, payments by our colleagues or to protect the security of the communities.
The world needs the information presented in Wikipedia, and today it is even more important than ever before.
At this time, to significant results for the world, it is important not only what we do, but how we do it.
Due to the importance of this mission and your role in this process, we will make important changes to the order of our joint work, starting next week.
Correction of our work and schedule
As Robin said earlier, the c-team team gathered yesterday evening to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
During the conversation, we discussed our ideas on the most effective measures in the current situation and the best ways to ensure the organization’s sustainability during that period.
The vast majority of us wanted to remove tension and support our long-term mission.
If you want to withdraw, let it be so.
For all staff, contractors and non-state employees:
According to our expectations, it will need to work about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week before the subsequent orders are received.
We do not announce weekends: if you can work normally for more hours, it is permitted for the purposes of our mission.
However, the world is unpredictable now; no matter what your needs are, whether it is to take care of your relatives, buy food or go to a doctor, your well-being is our number one priority.
We do not monitor your working hours.
If you are sick, you should not work.
This is clear and unquestionable, but we are talking about it.
You don’t need to register a hospital list or a check-in: just inform your manager and help the team review the calendar and work schedule to ensure the coverage of key areas.
(If you have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, please tell Brian from T&C Ops so that T&C can provide support and attention from the guide to your situation).
The payment of the hourly rates will be carried out in full.
We have already announced and confirmed our intention to comply with obligations to our contractors and employees with an hourly payment rate.
Each person will receive a payment according to the usual hourly rates applied under normal circumstances.
This in particular involves periods of illness when you cannot work.
If you want to work, we will support you.
Many people use work as a way to direct their efforts into the world around us.
What we do can bring amazing results, especially in such times.
Again, it is about self-help.
We ask you to communicate with our manager so that we know what to expect and can adjust our actions accordingly.
Some types of work are considered significant.
Such activities should always be supported.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust&Safety and Fundraising teams (including others) perform critical work that may require additional support.
We initiate a process for all divisions to evaluate current goals and focus on providing support, which is extremely important for our mission.
There are many tasks for each of us, and we’re just focusing on the most significant projects.
The delay today does not mean negative consequences in the future.
We don’t plan to work “two more to recover the lost” after the end of the pandemic.
You will not need to work overtime to comply with unreal deadlines for the current time.
We acknowledge that the circumstances have changed and we will work on setting new goals and deadlines as possible.
What is going on with the APP (Annual Plans)?
To adapt to the new reality and expectations on the volume of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the deadlines for the implementation of our Annual Plan for 2020-2021.
We intend to propose an extension of the deadlines for our plan for 2019-2020, thus providing more time for the formation of the budget, which will allow employees to give priority to critical work, self-help and care for loved ones, and at the same time everyone who needs or wants to work will be provided with a shortened schedule for the next few weeks.
This extension of the deadlines allows to significantly reduce the current planning burden and tension throughout the organization.
The next week we will submit our proposal to the Council, inform the representatives and teams of the relevant information on the following steps immediately after receiving the appropriate confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for the leadership role in this work.
Office status, risks and cleaning
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues from San Francisco could be infected with COVID-19.
However, in addition to numerous precautions, we hired an antivirus cleaning team to disinfect all the surfaces in the office in San Francisco.
They used medical-class antiviral solutions to disinfect all surfaces, as well as reception and lift halls, through which access to our floor is possible.
The building applies its own rules that prescribe caution with the use of products that ensure the safety of its tenants.
We feel that the office will be well prepared for the period when we decide to return.
Our office in the District of Columbia (DC) is located in the WeWork network, which has shared with us and all the staff in the DC, its rules related to COVID-19.
Last week, our office in the county of Colombia completely moved to remote work in accordance with the instructions received in San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues from New York know, we also discussed the issue of renting a room in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue, but can be postponed.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our old colleagues working remote know about the possibility of adjusting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended to limit the duration of meetings to one or two hours.
If necessary for longer sessions, consider the possibility of dividing them into a course consisting of a few days.
Clearly determine the purpose of the meeting, the agenda and spread the materials in advance to get acquainted.
By default, use the video connection, to facilitate interaction and communication, use tools such as Google Docs and Zoom.
For convenience, appoint a coordinator - the person who will monitor the receipt of questions in the chat and monitor the list of speakers, as well as the person responsible for keeping notes (or joint observation).
If you need to use convenient equipment, contact the technical support service by e-mail.
Take advantage of the Wellness Reimbursement program when purchasing snacks.
Connect to the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about the distributed work.
The HR Operations team studies the ergonomic guidelines available in the webinar format to promote efficiency of distributed work throughout the organization.
Last week we asked all community grants to cancel Wikimedia-funded mass events such as “editathons” until the WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We understand and notify that our requests for such cancellations and other restrictions may result in the impossibility of agreed grant measures, and no one will be punished for forced delays or changes in such purposes.
The next week we will host the following events with additional guidelines on Wikimania, as well as other regional and thematic conferences of the community.
The general mood in the global community is not only an embarrassment in connection with the break, but also a sense of relief in connection with mutual understanding and the ability to focus on their own communities, Wikimedia and not only.
As for prospects, CRT works on a page in Meta-Wiki, which will provide a community space that allows you to track the impact and communication.
We remain in touch with issues related to COVID-19
We will send to your calendar an invitation to a special staff meeting that will take place next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
This time we will take advantage of the opportunity to further share up-to-date information, answer your questions and spend time together connecting to each other.
We are together in this situation and ready to help everyone as we can.
At the same time, you can still receive information from such an e-mail, and other important information on COVID-19 from Office Wiki.
CRT will update such pages, and all information will be collected in one place.
We also work onining regular communication with staff living in countries that have been significantly affected by the current situation.
If you have questions about trips, events, key workflow, information illumination problems or if necessary, contact the CRT.
We are ready to provide support and provide communication if necessary.
If you have any confidentiality issues, please contact by email Brian Judan, Director of HR International Global Operations.
No such changes should be considered as a refusal to our work and our obligations.
It is rather the opposite: it is the recognition of the possible current need for a radically new adaptation of our work and commitments.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support each other and provide the opportunity to continue our work, to provide the necessary support to our movement and the whole world through the necessary service.
Our planned work will wait for the appropriate times.
Today is the time to support each other and create a space for important work coming in the coming weeks and months.
For this to happen, we will need help from each of you; and we need you to be able to take care of yourself and your families, and to work with the maximum commitment as soon as such a need arises.
Now, please wash your hands and don’t hurt your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S), and other members of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin-reversing enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the external surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 counteracts the activity of the corresponding angiotensin-reversing enzyme (ACE), reducing the content of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising solution for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. AC2 also serves as a cell entry point for some coronavirus.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-reversing enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metal enzyme located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the N-end peptidase domain M2 and the C-end transport domain of the renal amino acid collector.
ACE2 is a single-passing membrane protein type I, its fermentally active domain falls on the surface of the lungs and other tissues.
The cellular ACE2 domain is separated from the transmembran domain by another enzyme known as shedaza, and the obtained soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually eliminated with the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most alveolar type II lungs cells, thin intestinal enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and the cell of the smooth arterial muscles of most organs.
The biosynthesis of ACE2 and RNA is also found in the corner of the brain, streyatum, hypothalamus and the brain stool.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as an ACE counterweight.
ACE divides the hormone angiotensin I into vascular angiotensin II.
ACE2, in turn, separates the carboxyl end amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into vasodilatatory angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also divide a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9] -bradikinin, apellin, neurotensin, dinorphine A and grelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of the SLC6A19 neutral amino acids carrier and is present with Hartnoop disease.
As a transmembran protein, ACE2 serves as the primary cell entry point for some coronavirus, including HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV (SARS causing virus), and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 causing virus).
Strictly, the connection of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spike S1 protein with the fermentative ACE2 domain on the cell surface leads to endocytosis and translocation of both the virus and the enzyme into endosomes located inside the cells.
This entry process also requires the primation of the S serum protease TMPRSS2 carrier, the inhibition of which is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic means. This has led some to the thought that a decrease in ACE2 levels in cells can help fight infection.
However, many professional communities and regulatory bodies recommend continuing standard therapy with APF and BRA inhibitors.
According to a systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012, “the use of APF inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of pneumonia by 34% compared to the control group.”
Furthermore, “the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients receiving APF inhibitors who were at higher risk of pneumonia, especially in patients with stroke and heart failure.
The use of APF inhibitors was also associated with a decrease in pneumonia mortality, although the results were less reliable than in patients with the general risk of pneumonia.”
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is believed to be a novelty in the therapy for acute lungs damage and apparently improves lung hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with acute respiratory failure syndrome caused by lipopolysaccharides.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours, and the beginning of action is 30 minutes, in addition to the duration of the exposure is 24 hours.
Some data indicate that rhACE2 may become a promising remedy for people with intolerance to classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases with increased circulating angiotensin II. The introduced rhACE2 was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory stress syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are mobile software applications designed to help in the epidemiological investigation in the conditions of the coronavirus pandemic 2019-20 years, i.e. in the detection of persons (“contacts”) who could contact the infected person.
In some regions, a number of applications have been developed or proposed, officially supported by the authorities.
Several options of contacts tracking applications have been developed.
This led to discussions on privacy issues, especially with regard to those systems that are based on tracking the geographical location of users of the applications.
More soft options in this regard include using Bluetooth signals to record the user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they will combine their efforts to integrate Bluetooth-based support features directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the government, together with Alipay, has launched an app that allows citizens to check whether they have communicated with people infected with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. in Singapore, the application called TraceTogether is used.
The app was developed by local IT companies, has an open source and will be transferred under government control. North Macedonia has launched the app "StopKorona!", which works on Bluetooth, helping to track contacts with potentially infected people and providing operational communication with health authorities.
The application was jointly developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was expected to register in the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government said that the contact tracking app is in the final stage of development and will be available for deployment within a few weeks. similar applications are scheduled to be launched in Ireland and France (“StopCovid”).
Australia and New Zealand are considering the possibility of using applications based on the Singapore TraceTogether app and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to use the app with the geo-zone function, the aim of which is to monitor that patients diagnosed with COVID-19, residing in Moscow, do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security at the University of Cambridge, points out a number of potential practical problems that may arise with app-based systems, including false operations and potential inefficiency in case the application is used by only a small portion of the population.
Due to concerns about the spread of misleading or malicious “coronavirus” applications, Apple has limited the list of organizations that may offer their coronavirus-related applications to the App Store, including only “official” or other reliable organizations in this list.
Google and Amazon also imposed similar restrictions.
Participants of the privacy campaign expressed concern about the consequences of mass observation on the population through coronavirus-related applications; in particular, the question was raised about whether the observation infrastructure created to fight the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled when the threat disappears.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have published a statement calling for a limitation of this type of supervision.
The organizations have announced eight conditions they propose for government projects:
the monitoring must be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
the extension of monitoring and monitoring should be accompanied by a limitation of the duration;
the use of the data should be restricted for the purposes of combating the spread of COVID-19;
the security and anonymity of the data must be protected and evidence of such security must be provided;
digital surveillance should exclude cases of exacerbation of discrimination and marginalization;
any exchange of data with third parties shall be determined at the legislation level;
protection against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have also published their lists of conditions.
Google and Apple are proposing their joint plan to solve the problem of constant monitoring, which is to remove the tracking mechanism from the operating systems of their devices as soon as the need disappears.
Some countries use network location tracking instead of applications, which excludes the need to download the application and the possibility of avoiding tracking.
In Israel, network tracking has been approved.
Network solutions that have access to source location data also have major potential confidentiality problems.
However, not all systems with central servers should have access to personal location data; a number of confidentiality systems have been developed that use central servers only for communication (see section below).
In South Korea, a system that does not use the application as a base was used to track contacts.
Instead of using a special app, the system collected tracking information from different sources, including tracking data on mobile devices and card transactions, and then combined them to create notifications in the form of text messages that were sent to potentially infected persons.
The government not only used this information to warn citizens about potential contacts with infected persons, but also made the location information publicly available, which became possible due to substantial changes in information protection legislation that were introduced after the MERS explosion in that country.
Access to such information can be obtained through a number of applications and websites. Countries, including Germany, consider the possibility of using both centralized systems and systems that keep confidentiality.
As of April 6, 2020 the details have not yet been announced.
Tracking contacts that keep confidentiality is a stable concept, a significant volume of research literature dated at least 2013 year. As of April 7, 2020, more than ten expert groups worked on confidentiality solutions such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record the user’s approach to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a product of coordination efforts that include both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized tracking with privacy preservation (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), confidentiality protocols, mobile contact tracking mechanisms (PACT) and others.
These protocols are responsible for ensuring that identified personal data never leave the device and all comparisons occur on it.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab is engaged in developing SafePaths, a platform that ensures confidentiality when collecting and using location data or crossing routes to track the distribution of COVID-19.
The work of this platform is based on the research listed in the “Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic” document published in March 2020, another similar project is the SafeTrace platform, developed by Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technology, which was also originally founded by MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses reliable hardware technologies that enable users to exchange confidential location and health data with other users and officials without risking the confidentiality of these data.
On April 5, 2020, groups sharing the same approach and using similar protocols established a global TCN coalition with the aim of reducing fragmentation and ensuring the global compatibility of applications for tracking and notification, which is a key factor in their widespread spread.
On April 9, 2020, the government of Singapore announced that it opened the source code BlueTrace used in the work of its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control the operation of mobile platforms Android and iOS, announced a contact tracking initiative, which, as they claimed, will ensure confidentiality, and which is based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and encryption that enables confidentiality.
They also published the technical characteristics of the main technologies used in the operation of the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be developed in three stages:
Developing tools that allow governments to create official applications to track the movement of people infected with coronavirus, but with the confidentiality of data
By integrating this feature directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple are planning to solve problems with constant monitoring, first by introducing the system through operating system updates and then removing it in the same way after the threat disappears.
Reposition of a drug (also known as re-profiling, re-directing, change of tasks or therapeutic re-directing of drugs) is a re-profiling of an approved drug for the purpose of treating a disease or a medical condition other than the disease initially planned in the development.
This is one of the areas of scientific research that is currently used to develop safe and effective methods of treatment of COVID-19.
Other areas of research include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and the transplantation of reconvalescent plasma.SARS-CoV-2 contains approximately 66 proteins exposed to drugs, each of which has several ligand-binding areas.
The analysis of these binding areas serves as a suitable basis for the development of an effective anti-viral drug against the proteins COVID-19.
The most important target proteins for SARS-CoV-2 are papayan-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase, helicase, protein S and ADF-ribofosfatase.
Hussein AA and co-authors in their pre-clinical study studied several candidate compounds that were then optimized and analyzed their structural similarities with the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a highly effective drug against SARS-CoV-2, which will be recommended for clinical trials.
Chlorokin is an anti-malaria drug, which is also used in the treatment of some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that chlorokin and the associated hydroxychlorokin will be among the four drugs studied in the framework of the clinical test Solidarity.
New York Governor Andrew Kuomo announced that the testing of chlorokin and hydroxychlorokin will begin in the state of New York on March 24. March 28 the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychlorokin sulfate and chlorokin phosphate in accordance with the Emergency Authorization for Use (EUA).
The treatment scheme has not been approved during the FDA clinical trials process and is permitted in accordance with EUA only as a experimental treatment for emergency care in patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment according to clinical trials schemes.
The CDC stated that "the order of use, dosage or duration of taking hydroxychlorokin for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection has not yet been established."
Doctors say they use the drug when “there is no other way out.”
The Turkish research group in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chlorokin in combination with zinc and vitamins A, C and D.
Large scale studies are conducted at the Duke University and Oxford University.
The New York University School of Medicine in Langon studies the safety and effectiveness of the preventive application of hydroxychlorokin.
Chinese clinical trials in Uhan and Shenzhen showed that favipiravir was “unseenly effective.”
In Schengen, 35 patients who took this drug received a negative result in an average of 4 days, while in 45 patients who did not take the drug, the duration of the disease was 11 days.
The study was conducted in Uhan, where 240 patients with pneumonia were observed, one half of whom received favipiravir and the second half was umifenovir.
The Italian pharmaceutical department reminded the public that the results showing the effectiveness of the drug are scarce and should not be considered final.
On April 2, Germany announced that it will purchase the drug in Japan to fill out its stocks and use military resources to deliver it to university hospitals where the drug will be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe told Trump administration about the possibility of purchasing the drug. The drug may be less effective in advanced cases of the disease.
Its use may be unsafe for pregnant patients or for patients trying to get pregnant.
According to the results of one study dedicated to the combination of antiviral drugs “Lopinavir” and “Ritonavir” (Kaletra), it was concluded that “the effectiveness of the drug’s use was not identified.”
The drugs were designed to inhibit the replication of HIV by linking to protease.
A group of researchers from the University of Colorado are trying to modify drugs to find a compound that will be linked to SARS-CoV-2 protease.The scientific community criticizes the re-profiling of drugs that were specially designed for the treatment of HIV and AIDS.
WHO has included the combination of lobinavir and ritonavir in the international “Solidarity” test.
Remdesvir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences for the treatment of Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections. Later, Gilead Sciences employees found that remdesvir has an antiviral activity in vitro in relation to a variety of philo, pneumonia, paramyx and coronavirus.
One of the problems associated with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preliminary studies show that remdecivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Currently several clinical trials are carried out, including two carried out by the University Clinics of Cleveland; one is carried out in patients with a moderate form of the disease, and the other - in patients with a more severe form of it.
There are currently three clinical trials on intravenous intake of vitamin C for people who are hospitalized with a serious form of COVID-19: two placebo-controlled studies (China, Canada) and one without placebo use (Italy).
On March 24, 2020, antibiotics of azithromycin were tested in New York.

Tocylisumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved in China.
Also testing in Italy and China, see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical 2019 coronavirus vaccine (COVID-19).
Despite the fact that no vaccine has passed any clinical trials, numerous attempts to develop such a vaccine continue to take place.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it does not expect the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine to be obtained earlier than in 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates underwent stage I safety studies.
COVID-19 virus was detected in December 2019.
In 2020, the major outbreak of this disease spread around the world, leading to significant investments in the development of the vaccine and research activities related to it.
Many organizations use published genoms to develop possible SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.
As announced in April, the key objectives of the CEPI vaccine development initiative are to provide the necessary speed, production capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists that at the beginning of 2020 there were 10 different technological platforms in the research and development stage to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Some of the platform’s main objectives included in stage I security research:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (developer of stage I and vaccine candidate: Moderna, IRNA-1273)
virus vector (developer of stage I and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus vector type 5)
As CEPI scientists in April, 115 potential vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of them are used in approved active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute); in addition, 37 vaccines candidates were, but there is little public information about them (presumably are in the planning or development stage).
In stages I-II, pre-security and immunogenic testing is carried out, usually randomized, placebo-controlled and on several areas with the simultaneous determination of more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III tests typically cover more participants, including the control group; at this stage the drugs are tested for effectiveness in the prevention of the disease and at the same time the side effects are tracked with optimal doses.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested on humans (they are still in the pre-clinical stage).
On January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia, announced that it will explore the potential of a molecular injection vaccine that genetically modifies viral proteins to stimulate immune reaction.

On March 17, 2020, the Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced that it will receive pre-clinical trials in April 2020, and their final vaccine candidate may start testing on humans in the autumn.
On March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Innovation in Epidemic Preparation (CEPI), France, announced a $4.9 million investment in a COVID-19 vaccine development consortium with the participation of the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh. The total CEPI investment in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine is $29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners in the development of COVID-19 vaccines are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the universities of Hong Kong, Oxford and Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that the scientists began testing six different candidates for animal vaccines.
Researchers at Imperial College, London, announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-amplified RNA vaccine from COVID-19.

At the end of March, the Canadian government announced to allocate $275 million to fund 96 medical countermeasures research projects against COVID-19, including the development of numerous vaccine candidates in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and Saskatchewan University initiatives.
Approximately at the same time, the Canadian government announced that it will allocate $192 million specifically for the development of the vaccine against COVID-19, as well as plans for the creation of a national vaccine bank, which will enter several new vaccines that could be used in the event of a new coronavirus explosion.
On April 2, 2020, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine the PittCoVacc test, a possible COVID-19 vaccine on mice, stating that “MNA introduced subunity SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccines, causing strong answers to antigen-specific antibodies [in mice], which appeared 2 weeks after immunization.”
On April 16, 2020, the Canadian Pharmaceutical School of the University of Waterloo announced the development of a potential DNA-based vaccine, which is likely to be produced in the form of a nasal spray.
With the help of bacteriophages, the DNA will reproduce within human bacteria and form harmless viral-like particles that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three U.S. universities joined the resources of IBM supercomputers in combination with the cloud computing resources of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have other advantages in addition to the disease prevention properties.
Another randomized study, which is conducted in Australia, covers 4170 health workers.
The vaccines developed may be unsafe or ineffective.
Early studies on evaluating the effectiveness of vaccines using animal models characterized by COVID-19, such as ACE2-transgen mice, other laboratory animals and lower primates, indicate the need for measures to prevent infection with biosafety level 3 in the treatment of living viruses, as well as international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on animal models.
By 2020, there are no medications or protective vaccines to treat SARS that would be safe and effective for humans.
According to research published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines for the treatment of atypical pneumonia was a priority for governments and public health institutions around the world.
When MERS began to spread, it was believed that the SARS study that was carried out at that time could become the standard for the development of vaccines and therapeutics against MERS-CoV infection.
By March 2020 there was one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine, which passed stage I of clinical trials on humans, and three more vaccines, all of which were viral vector-based vaccines and were in development, two - adenovirus (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one - MVA-Vector (MVA-MERS-S).
In social media, a conspiracy theory was spread, claiming that the COVID-19 virus is not new at all, and that the vaccine from it already exists.
Publications on social networks cited the words of some patients who claimed the existence of patents on the genetic sequences of other coronavirus tribes, such as the coronavirus SARS, as well as on vaccines for these tribes.
Coronavirus is a disease identified in 2019 (COVID-19), a infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The most common symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include a feeling of fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat pain, loss of odor and stomach pain.
The time from the first manifestation of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but it can also vary from two to fourteen days.
Most cases are reduced to manifestation of mild symptoms, but in some cases the disease turns into viral pneumonia and polyorganic insufficiency.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases of infection were recorded in 210 countries and regions, with more than 153,000 people dying from the disease.
The virus is mainly spread when people are in close contact with each other, often through microscopic drops emitting into the air during cough, coughing or conversation.
Though these drops are formed during breathing, they usually pose a threat by falling on the ground or on the surface, but are not transmitted through the air at large distances.
People are also infected by touching the contaminated surface and then their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can live on the surface for 72 hours.
It is most infectious within the first three days after the appearance of symptoms, although its spread may be possible both before the appearance of symptoms and in the later stages. The standard diagnostic method is a polymerous chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (RT-PCR) on the sample taken as a moisture from the nasopharyngeal.
The use of medical masks is recommended to patients with suspicion of the disease, as well as those who take care of them.
Recommendations on the use of medical masks by the population differ: some agencies recommend not using them at all, some recommend their use, and others require it.
Currently there is no vaccine or specific treatment for the COVID-19 virus.
The local spread of the disease has been recorded in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Infected persons may not have any symptoms or have symptoms of flu, such as fever, cough, fatigue and depression.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, constant pain or feeling compressed in the chest, awakening, difficulty awakening, bleeding of the face or lips; if the above symptoms are present, you should immediately seek medical help.
Fewer symptoms of the disease of the upper respiratory tract can be observed, such as swelling, colds or throat pain.
Also, gastrointestinal symptoms are observed in different percentages, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.
Some cases of the disease registered in China were originally manifested only by a feeling of compression in the chest and frequent heartbeat.
In some cases, the disease can progress, developing into pneumonia, polyorganic insufficiency, and as a result, death occurs.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can vary from two to 14 days.
In 97.5% of people, the symptoms begin to appear within 11.5 days after infection. According to the available data, the symptoms do not appear in all infected.
The role of such unsymptomatic carriers in the transmission of the disease is still completely unknown, but preliminary data indicate that they may contribute to the spread of the infection.
The percentage of infected people with unsymptomatic course of the disease is currently unknown, it is only being studied; while the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) that in 20% of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations related to the virus the course of the disease was unsymptomatic.
The National Health Commission of China began to include non-symptomatic cases in its daily report since April 1; of the 166 infection cases registered on that day, 130 (78%) refused to be non-symptomatic at the time of testing.
Both moisture and saliva can have a higher concentration of the virus.
With a loud speech, more drops are released into the air than when speaking with a normal noise.
A study conducted in Singapore found that with open cough, drops can spread at a distance of up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
The virus is usually not transmitted by air, but the National Academy of Sciences has assumed that the transmission of the virus particles by a bio-erosol is still possible, and the test of the air processed by air collectors located in the corridors outside the human rooms showed the presence of a viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as infusion and cardiovascular resuscitation, may lead to dispersion of respiratory products and consequently to the spread of the virus in the air.
There are also concerns that the virus may spread through the feces, however, this risk is considered low. The virus is the most infectious when people have symptoms; the spread of the virus is possible until the symptoms appear, but this risk is small.
The staff of the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) claim that it is not yet quite clear how easily the virus spreads, yet it is known that one patient usually infects 2–3 other people.
In particular, it was found that on the cardboard surface the virus can live for one day, on the plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (AISI 304) - up to three days, and on 99% of copper surfaces - up to 4 hours.
These indicators, however, vary depending on moisture and temperature.
Soap and washers with their correct use have a pretty useful effect in the fight against infection: soap destroys the fat protection layer of the virus, disactivating it in this way, and is also able to remove it from the surface of the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (chirurgical disinfectant) are less effective against this virus. During a study conducted in Hong Kong, slice samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first test showed the highest concentration of the virus in the blood, and in the sixth patient the highest content of the virus in the blood was detected on the second day of the test.
The severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute coronavirus respiratory syndrome, first detected in three people with pneumonia from the group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Uhan.
All the signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are also found in coronavirus.
Being outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by domestic soap, which opens its protective membrane.SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the original SARS-CoV.
Light is the organ most exposed to COVID-19, as the virus penetrates the host cells through the angiotensin-reversing enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most common in alveolar lung cells type II.
The virus connects to ACE2 and penetrates the host cell with the help of a characteristic surface glycoprotein – the “ship” (peplomer).
12% of infected people who entered the hospital in Uhan were diagnosed with acute myocardial damage, which is more common in a severe form of the disease.
The frequency of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders observed during the progression of the disease, but acute myocardial damage may also be associated with the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are present in the heart in large amounts as they participate in the work of this organ.
High frequency of trombosis (31%) and venous tromboembolia (25%) was observed in patients in OIT with COVID-19, and may indicate adverse forecasts. Autopsy of patients who died from COVID-19, showed the presence of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and lymphocytes-containing inflammatory infiltrates in the lungs.
Despite the fact that SARS-COV-2 has a tropism to the ACE2 expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 course have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it was found that pathogenic GM-XF T cells correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes that issue IL-6 and severe lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.
In the opening, lymphocytal infiltrates were also detected.
The WHO has also published several test protocols on this disease.
Polymerase chain reaction in real time (RT-PCR) is a standard method of testing.
The test is usually carried out on respiratory samples obtained by a moisture from the nasopharyngeal, but a moisture sample from the nose or scratch can also be used.
The results are usually ready for a period of several hours to two days.
You can also take blood tests, but they require two blood samples taken with an interval of two weeks, and their results do not matter directly.
Chinese scientists managed to identify the coronavirus stam and publish its genetic sequence so that scientists in laboratories around the world could independently develop tests by the method of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to identify the presence of this virus.
As of April 4, 2020, tests on antibodies that could detect the presence of infection at the present time, as well as the fact of possible infection in the past, were in the development stage, but have not yet received broad spread.
The Chinese experience of studying the results of the data tests showed that their accuracy is only 60-70%.
On March 21, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Quality Control Administration (FDA) approved the first test for diagnosis on the site, granting permission for its use at the end of this month. In the diagnostic instructions issued by the Zhongnan University Hospital, the methods for detecting the infection on the basis of clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk are indicated.
Two-sided multi-dollar subplural focuses of fusion of the type of "mato glass" with peripheral, asymmetrical and apostherial distribution are common symptoms that are detected in the early stages of the disease.
Subplural domination, the symptom of a cylindrical bridge (a long stretching of the corner with a variable alveolar filling) and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
There are few data about microscopic lesions and pathophysology of COVID-19.
The main results of the pathological study performed during the opening:
Macroscopy: pleuritis, pericarditis, stretching and swelling of the lungs
There are four types of severity of viral pneumonia:
light form of pneumonia: lung vomiting, pneumocytes hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytal infiltration and the formation of multi-core giant cells
severe form of pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory stress syndrome (ORDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Healing pneumonia: the organization of exudates in the alveolar cavities and lung interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: diffuse intra-vascular swelling (AIDS syndrome); leukerithroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding people's places, frequently washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, observing respiratory hygiene rules, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a handheld for cough or chewing, or, in the absence of a handheld, covering the mouth and nose with the inner side of the lock area of the hand.
After coughing or chewing, it is recommended to carry out a high-quality hygiene procedure for the hands.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of tissue face masks in public places, in particular, in order to limit the transmission of infection to people with unsymptomatic course of the disease. Social distancing strategies are aimed at reducing the contact of infected patients with large groups of people; within the framework of these measures, schools and enterprises were closed, the movement of citizens was restricted and large public events were repealed.
Recommendations on distancing also implies that people should be at a distance of at least 6 feet (1.8 m) from each other.
Since the development of the vaccine is expected to be completed not earlier than 2021, the main part of the anti-COVID-19 measures are reduced to a reduction of the peak of the epidemic known as the "out of the plate".
CDC also recommends frequently washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after a visit to the toilet or with severe hands pollution, as well as before and after eating and swallowing, coughing or chewing.
The CDC also recommends the use of desinfecting alcohol content (alcohol content - at least 60%) hand-treatment means, but only in cases where soap and water are not available.
In these compounds are used ethanol or isopropanol, which have an antimicrobial activity.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial disputes in alcohol and is not an appropriate means for antiseptic hand treatment.
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
Patients are shown support therapy, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, and support of other affected vital organs.
CDC recommends that those who suspect that they are infected with the virus wear a regular medical mask.
Extra-corporal membrane oxidation (ECMO) has been used to solve the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being studied.
To strengthen immunity, it is recommended to comply with the rules of personal hygiene, healthy lifestyle and diet.
Supporting therapy methods can be shown to patients with mild symptoms in the early stages of the disease. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for care for patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the United States, intensive therapy doctors and pulmonologists have summarized the therapeutic recommendations of various institutions in a free resource – IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For the treatment of symptoms as first-line drugs, some medical professionals recommend making a choice in favour of paracetamol (acetaminophen) compared to ibuprofen.
When performing procedures during which air drops may occur, such as infusion or hand drying, precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of the virus transmission, especially in medical facilities.
The medical staff caring for people with COVID-19, CDC recommends placing in the air-drop isolator (AIIR) — an additional measure in addition to standard contact and air precautions.
Recommended means of individual protection: protective dress, respirator or medical mask, eye protection tools and medical gloves. Of the above means it is preferable to use respirators rather than medical masks.
The N95 respirators are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has approved the use of these respirators in accordance with the Emergency Application Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but when used not according to the instructions, the effectiveness in terms of protection against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed.
If medical masks are not available, the CDC recommends using protective face screens or, in the extreme case, make masks on your own at home.
In most cases, the COVID-19 flow forms are not heavy enough to require artificial lung ventilation or its alternatives, but there is a certain percentage of cases when it is necessary.
The type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with respiratory failure associated with COVID-19, is currently actively studied, and there are some evidence that intubations can be avoided by the nose oxygen canyon with intense air flow or two-level positive pressure in the respiratory tract.
It is not yet known whether any of these two methods is as effective for critical patients as HIV.
Some doctors make a choice in favour of invasive mechanical lung ventilation if it is available, as this method significantly restricts the spread of particles in the air compared to the nasal canal with intense air flow. The risk of severe form of the disease for elderly people (those who are over 60 years old, and especially those who are over 80 years old) is much higher.
In many developed countries there is a shortage of hospitals per capita, and the resources of health systems are too limited to cope with a sharp increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 infection in a severe form requiring hospitalization.
According to one study conducted in China, 5% of patients were hospitalized in intensive therapy departments, 2.3% needed mechanical support for lung ventilation and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19, eventually get to resuscitation.
The task of providing artificial lungs ventilation becomes complicated as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), developing with COVID-19, and oxygenation attract more and more problems.
IPLs with inhalation pressure support and PDCs are necessary to deliver the maximum amount of oxygen to the lungs and to ensure their minimum damage by ventilation, which can result in the development of pneumotorax.
On earlier models of the ventilator, a high PDKV may not be available.
Research on potential treatments began in January 2020, and at the moment several antiviral drugs are in the stage of clinical trials.
The most promising is the remediation.
The development of new drugs may last until 2021, but some of the drugs being tested have already been approved for other purposes or are in the latest stages of testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tested on patients with severe forms of the disease.
The recommended WHO volunteers take part in the testing of the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has provided temporary permission for the use of reconvalescent plasma as a experimental treatment in cases where human life is threatened by a serious or immediate danger.
Its use was not subject to clinical trials, which should be carried out to prove the safety and effectiveness of the treatment method.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app designed to fight the disease.
To log in, users must enter their name and ID number.
The app can detect “near contact” using the observation data and therefore identify the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-isolation, but also sends a notification to local health authorities. Analysis of large data collected from mobile phones, person recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence – such tools are used to track infected people and persons with whom they have contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government granted permission to security authorities to track the data of the mobile phones of people allegedly infected with the coronavirus.
Measures have been taken to ensure quarantine and protection for persons who may get in touch with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus, Deutsche Telekom provided the federal government agencies in Germany and the Robert Koch Institute with aggregated data on the location of mobile subscribers.
In Russia, person recognition technology has been introduced to identify carantine breachers.
Italian Regional Health Commissioner Giulio Gallera said that mobile operators report that “40% of people still continue to move throughout the territory.”
The German government held a 48-hour weekend programming marathon with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kalyulaid also called for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
People may experience stress due to quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or due to fear of the infection itself.
According to Rory O’Connor, “Strong social isolation, loneliness, health concern, stress and economic decline are the ideal conditions for harm to the mental health and well-being of people.”
The disease can occur in a mild form with minor or absent symptoms resembling other common diseases of the upper respiratory tract, such as a common cold.
Patients with a mild form of the disease usually recover within two weeks, while the treatment of patients with severe or critical forms may take three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may be at a higher risk of getting a severe form of COVID-19 based on data on other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, although similar data on COVID-19 are not available.
In people with the most severe course of the disease, COVID-19 can quickly progress to acute respiratory stress syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory insufficiency, septic shock or polyorgan insufficiency.
Complications of COVID-19 include sepsis, an abnormal thromb formation, as well as problems with the heart, kidneys and liver.
Thrombo-formation anomalies, especially an increase in prothrombin time, were described in 6% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, while renal disorder is observed in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of COVID-19 patients have increased liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were hospitalized.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death in patients transferred to the intensive therapy department was seven days.
According to cases of the disease in the early stages, the average time from the manifestation of the initial symptoms to the day of death was 14 days with a full range of six to 41 days.
According to a study conducted by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate among men was 2.8% and among women 1.7%.
Histopathological studies of postmortal lung samples indicate diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromixoid exudates in both lungs.
In the pneumocytes, viral cytopathic changes were observed.
The appearance of the lungs resembled the acute respiratory stress syndrome (ORDS).
In 11.8% of deaths registered by the National Health Commission of China, heart problems consisted of increased troponin levels or heart stops.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89% of hospitalized patients had previous health problems. The availability of medical resources and the socio-economic situation in the region can also affect mortality.
Mortality estimates vary depending on the state due to such regional differences as well as due to methodological difficulties.
Inadequately effective counting of cases in light form can lead to a surplus of mortality.
However, the fact that deaths occur as a result of diseases acquired in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
In smokers, severe symptoms of COVID-19 were developed 1.4 times more often, and such patients were about 2.4 times more likely to need intensive therapy or die compared to non-smokers.
The administration of one of the clinics in Hong Kong found that some patients recovered from the disease, the volume of the lungs decreased by 20-30%, and their scanning found damage.
After recovery, this can also lead to the "Post-Intense Therapy" syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether patients recovered from the virus are developing a stable immunity against it.
Judging by the flow of other coronavirus, this is considered likely, but it was also cases when after recovery from COVID-19 coronavirus tests were still positive.
It is believed that in these cases there was an exacerbated prolonged course of the disease, not a repeated infection.
It is believed that the virus is natural, has animal origin and is an infectious disease.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely caused by its transmission from person to person.
The study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, calls 1 December 2019 the earliest date of the first case of the disease.
According to the official data published by the WHO, this date is 8 December 2019.
A number of methods are usually used for the quantitative assessment of mortality.
All numbers vary depending on the region and time of the disease's spread, they are also influenced by the test volumes, the quality of health systems, the treatment schemes used, the time from the beginning of the disease's outbreak and the population parameters such as age, gender and general health.
At the end of 2019, the WHO awarded the disease emergency code according to ICB-10: U07.1 - for deaths from laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 - for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2.
According to statistics from the Johns Hopkins University, by April 17, 2020 the global number of deaths and infections was 6.9% (153 822/2 240 191).
Some other methods include the determination of the disease-related mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients who died as a result of the disease, and the determination of the infected infection-related mortality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and undiagnosed cases) who died as a result of the disease.
These statistics are not linked to a specific time and reflect the indicators of a certain layer of population from the moment of infection to the end of the course of the disease.
Despite the fact that antibodies are not produced in all patients who have suffered the infection, by the presence of such antibodies it is possible to understand how many people have been infected.
In the epicenter of the eruption in Italy, Castillo d'Adda, a small village with a population of 4,600 people, 80 people (1,7%) are no longer alive.
In Gangelt, the disease spread during the celebration of the carnival among young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths from COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.
Germany’s healthcare system was not overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population can have antibodies, judging by blood donor indicators.
COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (0,004% of the population).
The impact of pandemic and mortality levels are different for men and women.
According to studies conducted in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher in men.
The highest risk group is men over the age of 50; the gap between men and women is reduced only from the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The exact causes of this difference are unknown, but may be genetic and behavioral factors.
Gender immunological differences, less prevalence of smoking among women, accompanying diseases in men (e.g., hypertension manifested in men at a younger age than in women) can cause higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected were men, and 72% of deaths from COVID-19 were men.
By April 2020, the U.S. government will not keep gender statistics on COVID-19.
Scientific studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, flu and ARVI have different gender statistics.
The majority of health workers, especially nursing staff, are women, accordingly, they are more likely to get infected.
On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of the disease, COVID-19.
WHO’s head, Mr. Tedros Adanom Hebreysus, explains: “CO” means “corona”, “VI” means “virus”, “D” means “disease” (disease), and 19 years when the first explosion was detected: December 31, 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g., China), species of animals or groups of people, as required by international name recommendations aimed at preventing stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19, is called severe acute coronavirus respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In public reports, the WHO also uses the terms “COVID-19 virus” and “the COVID-19 virus.”
Both the disease and the virus itself are usually called a coronavirus.
During the initial outbreak in Uhan, China, the virus and disease were usually called "coronavirus" and "Uhank coronavirus".
In January 2020, in accordance with the 2015 recommendations on the use of geographical locations in the names of diseases and viruses, the WHO recommended using the terms "acute respiratory disease 2019-nCov" and "2019-nCoV" as temporary names of the virus and disease.
On February 11, 2020 the official names were published – “COVID-19” and “SARS-CoV-2”.
Due to the limits in standard supply chains, some digital service providers print medical materials, such as tampons for the removal of masks from the nose, as well as the details of the IVL devices.
In one of these cases, the Italian clinic urgently needed a ventilation valve, and the supplier could not deliver it in the required time, then one of the local productions was reprofiled and was able to print the necessary 100 valves per night.
After the first COVID-19 explosion, various conspiracy theories, misinformation and false information about the origin of the virus, its scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects began to spread on the Internet at a high speed.
People may be infected with the virus of other animals.
The results of the studies did not confirm the spread of the virus among pigs, flakes and chickens.
There is currently no approved vaccine against the virus or medications for its treatment.
Currently, government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers are conducting various international studies of vaccines and drugs from COVID-19.
In March, the WHO launched the SOLIDARITY Trial (SOLIDARITY TEST), which aims to assess the therapeutic effect of the four existing compounds considered to be the most effective to date.
There is no vaccine yet, but various organizations are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 penetrates into human cells through the ACE2 receptor, so scientific developments use the results of previous studies conducted on SARS-CoV.
There are three vaccine strategies.
First, the researchers are looking to create a whole-viral vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is aimed at causing a rapid immune response of the human body to a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the creation of a subunity vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that increases the sensitivity of the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies are aimed at destroying the S-shype protein, which helps the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is the development of vaccines based on nucleic acids (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new method of creating a vaccine).
Experimental vaccines developed according to any of these strategies should be tested for safety and effectiveness. 16 March 2020, the first clinical vaccine test on four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code, copied from the virus that causes the disease. The antibodies has been identified as one of the potential problems in the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this assumption has a controversial nature.
More than 300 active clinical trials will be conducted by April 2020.
The drugs approved for the treatment of malaria were evaluated in seven trials, four of which were on hydroxychlorokin or chlorokin.
The re-profilation of antiviral drugs is the majority of Chinese studies; by the end of April, nine phase III remdesvirus studies were conducted in several countries.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of vaccines and candidates for the treatment of COVID-19. With the same purpose, several other existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chlorokin and hydroxychlorokin, lobinavir / ritonavir, as well as lobinavir / ritonavir in combination with beta interferon, are also considered.
As of March 2020, there are preliminary data on the effectiveness of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients receiving remdecivir as an exception.
Phase III of clinical trials are already being carried out in the US, China and Italy. The use of chlorokin, previously used for the treatment of malaria, was considered in China in February 2020, and there are preliminary results.
However, there is a need for an expert assessment of the study.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend the use of chlorokin.
The Uhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose in one gram, but notes that doubling this dose is very dangerous and can lead to a fatal result.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued a license for the emergency use of hydroxychlorokin and chlorokin at the discretion of doctors treating patients with COVID-19.The Chinese instructions of the 7th edition also indicate interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir as a remedy against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitasoxanide was recommended for a detailed study in vivo, demonstrating the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in low concentrations. Studies have shown that to penetrate SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor it requires the reconciliation of the proteins of the transmembranate protease of serin 2 (TMPRSS2).
Studies on the use of chlorokin and hydroxychlorokin with or without azithromycin have serious restrictions that prevent the medical community from using these methods of treatment without further study. Azetamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and its role in the treatment of COVID-19 is unclear.
Hypercytokinemia may occur as a complication in the later stages of severe form COVID-19.
There is confirmation of the fact that hydroxychlorokin may have properties of hypercytokineemia. As a result of a small study conducted by the National Health Commission of China, tocylisumab was included in the recommendation for the treatment of coronavirus.
This drug came out on the 2nd stage of the non-randomized test, which is carried out at the national level in Italy, after positive results of its use were obtained in patients with a severe form of the disease.
In combination with a serum test for ferritin to detect cytokine storms, it is designed to counter such factors that are believed to be the cause of death in some patients.
In 2017, the FDA was approved an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist on the basis of retrospective thematic studies for the treatment of the steroid refractor cytokine release syndrome caused by another cause, T-cell therapy CAR.
Today, there is no randomized and controlled evidence that tocylisumab is an effective remedy for the cytokine release syndrome.
The transmission of cleansed and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of patients recovered from COVID-19, to people in need of them is now considered a non-vaccin method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested in the treatment of SARS patients, but its results have been uncertainty.
Viral neutralization is the expected effect with which passive antibodies therapy can provide protection against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as cell-dependent cytotoxicity and/or fagocytosis may be used.
Other forms of passive antibodies therapy, for example, with the use of manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are in the development stage.
The scale of reconvalescent blood serum, which consists of a liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains antibodies against this virus, may be increased.
