This does not confirm that some dinosaurs still had feathers, a theory advanced by Edda, but it does provide a broad explanation of what fossils generally cannot, such as color and triangular structure.
Experts say the animal's plumage was chestnut-white with a whitish or carotenoid-colored underside.
They are assisted in the creation of bird feathers.
 Since dinosaur feathers do not have the full-grown shaft called rachis, but have other forms of feathers - barbs and barbules - researchers believe that rachis were likely to have evolved later in the evolutionary cycle than the others.
The shape of the whale suggests that it is not a flying creature but a warm-up creature. Researchers suggest that even the dinosaur's tail is a large tail, but not a bird's tail.
Researchers suggest that although this is a dinosaur, the feathered insects are birds and not ground squirrels.

In comparison, the diet of animals (egg, chicken, and shrimp) is a fast-growing, nutrient-dense diet that contains all the essential fatty acids in the body.
In addition, it should not be surprising that our ancestors solved the problem of nutrients with the same technique as the mushrooms that live on the beach today.
