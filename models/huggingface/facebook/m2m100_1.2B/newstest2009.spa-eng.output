The Prague Stock Exchange ended with fewer points at the end of the day
After the rapid fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
The transactions of ČEZ shares reached approximately half the value they have on a normal day.
The Prague Stock Exchange, at the beginning of trading Tuesday, reacted immediately to Monday’s fall when it fell to about 6%.
The downturn this time is due to the fall in Wall Street stocks.
Also here is the reaction of the market to the outcome of the vote of the American Assembly of Representatives that refused to support the financial sector secretary’s stabilization plan.
Falling stocks in Asia
Asian stock exchanges experienced a dramatic drop on Tuesday, although the index eventually mitigated some of the losses throughout the day.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Stock Exchange index over the course of its financial day scored four percent, although it later mitigated its losses by reducing the drop by virtually 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index that follows the movements of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange fell 3.8 percent, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
The Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent but, in the end, the losses fell to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange, according to the Secretary of the Index, fell to 3.6 percent.
“The planned rescue operations in the U.S. are unsafe and this affects the financial markets around the world,” said Chief of the Hong Kong Monetary Office, Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it alone determines its monetary policy, that is, without dependence on the Central Bank of China.
Hong Kong’s interest rates are at the same level as those in the United States.
U.S. lawmakers should meet again as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and approve a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens that the fall will be felt in other countries.
Bloody bath of American stocks
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected a plan to help the financial system to which $700 billion (nearly 12 trillion crowns) should be allocated.
Lawmakers, in that way, ignored President George Bush’s invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would solve the underlying causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, U.S. stocks experienced a bloody bath and mainly the stock index recorded the biggest drop in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index dropped to almost seven percent, with a similar drop recorded for the last time in 1987.
The index dropped before it was announced but as soon as it was shown that the assembly’s proposal did not go ahead, the index began to drop freely.
Congress Retires: U.S. Government Could Inject $700 Billion into Banking
The top congressional and government representatives, President George W. Bush, agreed on a comprehensive pact on financial aid to the U.S. financial system.
The vote will take place at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers sparked a gap in talks about approving the bailout plan in its form of helping the U.S. financial system in the amount of $700 billion (approximately 12 trillion crowns).
However, it is not yet won.
Congressmen must refine some details of the contract before they can make public the final form of the law and that it be voted.
The plan to help the financial system will be discussed on Monday in the Assembly of Representatives.
Barney Frank, president of the Committee on Financial Services and the Bank of the Assembly, told Reuters on Sunday.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be held in the Senate not before Wednesday.
According to economists, the arrival of the ratification of the bailout plan should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
Then, however, it will come to "disappointment" thanks to the complex mechanisms whose help to the market will also reach in practice.
The plan must be effective.
“We have made a great progress.
We have resolved our disagreements regarding the shape of the package of measures to stabilize the market," Democrat Nancy Pelosiá told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
Representatives of lawmakers met Sunday night with Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give a definitive shape to the government fund.
This should buy out of the financial companies the unsold mortgage assets that lead the financial companies to heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
“We are about to close the agreement on the plan, which will work and must also be effective in the market.
It is still necessary to continue with the sanitation plan, but I think we are already in it,” Paulson said.
A sign to Asian
The global financial crisis expressly affects the rapidly falling stock market.
According to Democratic Senator Harry Reid from Nevada, lawmakers are doing everything they can to get Congress to finally approve an agreement on Sunday.
They want to reassure investors’ in the Asian financial market as these are those in the first time zone and where Congress could influence Monday’s trade.
However, for now there is nothing clear with certainty about when the two chambers of Congress will vote and, not even, if they will not stand still at the last moment with some problem.
Legislators expect it to be approved in the coming days.
The law, however, will undergo a number of changes.
The total amount intended to help the system should be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion must be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush has requested.
However, Congress could block the release of the remaining amount if it had the impression that the program is not fulfilling its function, which would be another $100 billion and, later, the last $350 billion.
Bush appreciated the progress of the meetings
On the other hand, the president can veto this decision but Congress can overcome its veto by a majority of votes.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program consisted of earning financial resources for the repurchase of bad mortgage bonds whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to finish paying their mortgages.
“We have worked on everything.
The House of Representatives should be ready to vote on the bill on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday,” said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
US President Bush is also pleased with the progress of the meetings.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was pleased with Saturday's progress and appreciated "the commitment of both sides to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Limitation of the armored contract
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, said lawmakers have decided on the responsibility of the program money to protect taxpayers from their losses, a relieving closure of the planned financial plan.
The new law should also limit so-called armoured contracts for directors of the program-participating companies, and create a committee that will have control of the Fund.
This should be directed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We’ve worked very hard on this, and we’ve made a big step forward towards a convention that will work and that will be effective for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also counts on helping homeowners who have problems with their payments.
The government would have to agree on new payments on the mortgages it buys in order to lower the monthly charges of payments to debtors’ deadlines and enable them to stay with their homes.
Tagged: psychological assistance
The proposed plan is, according to the chief economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea that will be realized but rather difficult.
"And this is why it is not known by what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be purchased.
This will be decisive for the distribution of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week, for the server iHNed.cz.
Whether the plan is approved now or early next week is, according to Marek, not so relevant.
“Much more important is that this week congressmen agree on their support and give them their goodwill as soon as possible.
This important and psychological agreement to reach that approval is, at this time, the most important thing,” Marek insisted.
Combat armed hand: the MP3 player against the mobile.
We advise you how to choose.
While almost every mobile player plays MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls.
What seems clear is that it is better to buy only the phone.
Yet there are enough reasons for man to acquire only the reproducer.
The choice practically depends on the way of its use and the demand of the future owner.
Probably it will be hard to acquire the most modern tocadiscos to listen to Maxim Turbulenc’s latest album.
On the other hand, this type of music products such as LPs no longer come out, and as far as their quality is concerned, there is no single objective reason to continue buying them.
If you pick up vinyl discs with art rock, jazz or blues music on your shelves, you are probably dreaming, at least, of this type of disc.
This is the same with the music that is on the go, that is, compressed, simplified music – MP3 music.
And here there are price and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, the same as for a Pink Floyd lover who will hardly try the twenty crowns market helmets.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for each.
The choice is wide.
It also determines the battery life.
Some of the best players much more than just playing music and even what not even most mobile phones.
No device today is as universal as the phone.
In front of the most elementary functions such as telephoning, sending messages, you can play music and video, record both, have a better or worse camera and even you can get to browse.
And when we consider the Smartphone and PDAs will also have a small computer in their pocket.
This is a small miracle as no refrigerator can make a grille and no television can photograph.
The universality of mobile phones also brings us disadvantages.
The more functions you use on the mobile, the sooner the screen indicator will light up asking to be recharged.
And music reproduction is one of the greatest sources of energy.
Few mobile phones can play music for more than ten or twelve hours, most of them much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest ones) have clearly higher performance.
Therefore, keep in mind that cheap mobile phones will not play for more than two hours.
If in addition to this, above all, they constantly call still, for more security, a charger for work - this is also true for the more expensive appliances.
With the MP3 player this problem will not be, since even the worst can withstand at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a charge.
Another problem occurs when recording music on the mobile.
Unfortunately, only a part of the devices have the universal USB connector and, in addition, not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course it is possible to record music directly on the memory card but only on some units without reduction can connect the small memory cards that are used on mobile phones.
On players, with some exceptions (iPod), no special software is required.
Just fill the device with music via the USB of the computer.
Most mobile phones and players create their own order in the music library according to the name of the performer, album title, genre or also according to user rating.
Some devices only show a directory with a tree structure similar to a Windows Search and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
The player tries to serve, the mobile knows more
For the choice of a particular equipment, you are interested in the strength of the accumulator, the memory capacity, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the convenience of its handling.
If you listen, above all, to the music as a background and will listen to it every day only for a while, like in the tram, then it is enough with any mobile that you play.
This is what practically any mobile can.
You should not even be interested in the format in which the mobile phone or player plays the music.
The MP3 is played by everyone and almost all the music that comes to you will be in this format.
It is among the most widespread and except for it the absolute majority of the devices play music in WMA format.
The least include the AAC format (format used by the company Apple and its iPod).
The best mobile devices also enable, for example, the purchase of music online.
It is enough to visit the competent pages of the operator (or any other service provider) and buy a song or album.
This service could be in itself just a weight argument to acquire a mobile for music.
Unfortunately the offer of the operators is miserable and the majority is limited only to the flying success themes of the radios.
Prices are also not the lowest.
However, in general, it is supposed that precisely this way of selling music (whether by GSM, internet or wireless internet) in the future will dominate the music industry.
Most people always carry a cell phone.
Whenever you want to listen to something, you will find the mobile phone in your pocket, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry a headphone or, at least, handsfree.
If not, you can use an integrated player that has virtually every mobile even if it is at least an MP3 player.
Probably the biggest advantage for many of the mobile phones with music will be their price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand.
Between three and four thousand crowns can already purchase a good walkman.
Most of you will limit the absence of an entry for classic headphones.
The best, even in terms of the technical part, such as phones equipped with an input of 3.5 mm. for classic headphones, cost up to fifteen thousand.
Again, the advantage of players is nothing more than their easy service.
The simplest players – not necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) – are managed by really anyone.
The minimal functions, their handling similar to the previous current casets or also to the touchdiscs is evident.
It does not represent a threat in the sense that by mistake we connect to the internet with the mobile and, consequently, gigantic account for data downloading.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobile phones (for example, the Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for changing the memory card (M2 type, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of a suitable card will reach two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
Basic models are usually equipped with only a 2 GB maximum capacity card.
Only the most expensive have a memory of 8 GB.
If you already have a mobile phone and you still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a look at Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
According to the capacity (maximum 2 GB) it is not necessary to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you are considered among the most demanding lovers of music, use the most specialized mobile-walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent keys for MP3 which makes a service as convenient as that of a single player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose walkman line phones have almost identical use as that of an independent MP3 player.
The same service and the same category in terms of price, over four thousand crowns, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery capacity (usually 15 hours, with a maximum performance of up to 35 hours), the above-mentioned brand brings them MP3 players.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
probably
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer virtually all the services as their Western European partners.
However, here we still miss something – the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
It will probably not take long to arrive.
That Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe, we have already written on mobil.cz.
The rest was also confirmed by the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ), which warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is one of the most expensive in the entire Union.
After the latest steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming charges it is likely to come to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators SMS sent from abroad will be cheaper than if they send them from home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really wants to fight.
Probably this seems paradoxical to us, since we have three mobile networks and their high coverage is more than 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that there is extreme competition in the Czech market.
Pavel Dvořák, Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ), also said that there is no place in the Czech Republic for any other operator.
It is true that for a classic operator with its own network it no longer has too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be very difficult to find some frequency).
However, there is still one possibility - the virtual operator.
Precisely the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market brought a prominent price decline before which the classic operators also had to react.
At the same time, even before shark such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the UK market, similar voices were heard both there and here.
It has been shown that there is room for this type of operators and that they can succeed.
There is no need to look for examples too far.
In February this year we informed you about the debut of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this operator managed to gain more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighbouring country.
On the other hand, after Mobilking is the Penta group that, apart from that, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U:fon.
The advantage of virtual traders is the ability to focus on many more specific target groups.
In addition, in order for them to operate effectively, they are enough with much fewer customers than a classic operator.
They do not involve relatively large expenses in the construction, operation and maintenance of the network.
In the world, this type of virtual operators are typically profiled with low costs – they offer cheap calls and SMS messages which, however, is often contrasted with the offer of more tailored services.
Thus, for example, Tesco mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half as cheap as compared to the competition.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a good hit to bet on a no trivial target group.
It is specifically directed to the man.
“The right man chooses Mobilking – it’s the operator you like and who you can trust,” says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, who works with this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say if a similar concept like that of Poland could get stuck in our country.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav Čepický said: “The Czech market is relatively small to access by segments on which most virtual operators rely.
In addition, from the point of view of the service supply is relatively saturated.”
In the Czech Republic there are no possibilities, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there will be a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, that will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the Czech Republic it doesn't seem too hopeful.
Rather, it is the launch of Mobilking in other countries in our region,” said Jana Studničková, a spokeswoman for the financial group Penta, in a phone call to mobil.cz.
He indirectly assured that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not inclined to this idea.
Rather, on the contrary, they try to do everything possible so that no potential competition arises.
Interest in the launch of a virtual mobile operator is already shown by the GTS Novera group that would like to take a step further to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of business customers.
“We have a great interest in this, in order to be able to offer our customers not only fixed phone services but also mobile phone services.
The sooner, the better.
With this possibility we have repeatedly encountered all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them we have managed to move forward in the meetings," said group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
Maybe there are better times.
It seems to be that, by unofficial information, the first official operator would have to arrive possibly already at the end of the year.
But for now his appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
“At this moment we believe that the situation is suitable for the emergence of a virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market compared to others is a very specific market.
So far no one has addressed us with any complex and serious project on this ground,” Vlastimil Sršeň, spokesman for Telefónica O2, told mobil.cz.
Other operators refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová, in exceptional accord with O2's opinion, adds: "Until today we have not registered any viable commercial project that, bilaterally profitable, can continue to develop."
He added: “In T-Mobile’s network, it will be difficult to find any virtual operator until the end of the year.
At this point we should already have on the table some concrete contract that would be possible to study in such a short time."
Vodafone focuses its attention on fulfilling the requirements of a 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický adds: “We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this in terms of spending and infrastructure sharing.
We consider it to be the biggest contribution from the customer’s point of view.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area lies in the partner with whom to establish a shared network for a fast internet on the mobile.”
Responsible offices - with nail and meat operators
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increased competition, which would lead to a drop in prices and thus a drop in profits.
So why facilitate entrance to competition?
When operators want to get something, they are able to shoot from the same rope, proof of this is the grip when U:fon appeared.
Per the biggest pressure on the ČTÚ was at the time of the entry of U:fon by T-Mobile.
This is attested by public information available on the ČTÚ website.
But right now U:fon serves as an argument for why not to accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová adds: “In addition, not long ago, the competitive environment in the mobile phone market was opened to a fourth operator.
As regards the character of the mobile telephony market in the Czech Republic, it is natural that the entry of another player into the market would be very demanding for him and, above all, for his services.”
That is why this access to mobile operators is tremendously discouraging due to the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory body.
It is not just the ČTU’s position, which unfortunately has no competition to intervene in commercial bidding, unlike Britain and other developed countries.
This belongs purely to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Procurement (ÚOHS).
However, she expressed her typical stance on this problem.
“The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after an agreement on the rental of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile operator and a virtual operator was concluded.
So far, no agreement has been closed since the offer of the potential interested parties was not interesting enough for the classic operators,” added Kristián Chalupa, of the UOHS Foreign Relations Department.
These statements do not surprise the representatives of the operators.
For offices that should represent the interests of consumers, this is more than a consideration, besides that they should observe that no one takes advantage of their position in the market.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In abroad where virtual operators work normally we can observe that their entry into the market contributed to the fall in prices of mobile phone services"
Obviously, pressure on the proper functioning of the market means and the fall in prices do not fall within the interests of the OHSS.
Really the dramatically shocking thing in this whole case lies in the dissonant reactions that result from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether this really is a coincidence, is offered by itself.
It is the same as with the price of gasoline in the gas stations because it is clear that it is the work of chance and of a tough struggle for competition.
“The Office in this sense has not found signs of unfair competition and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the traders has a dominant position and therefore do not have a corresponding rise in responsibility in their actions in the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile phone market to virtual operators, rather, are lacking, as are telecommunications regulators,” Chalupa added to his response.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many conflicting points.
Evidently, there is a relevant market analysis by the ČTÚ according to which telecommunications is, from the point of view of commercial bidding, a single market.
In this type of market, of course, none of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
However, some of the legal experts offer another approach - in order for a virtual operator to emerge it is always necessary the agreement with the network administrator.
And the mobile operator – with all its logic – has the monopoly of its network.
Therefore, in a particular segment it must necessarily be dominant.
And if this argument is not accepted, at least for ÚOHS should represent a warning the fact that three mobile operators rise strikingly in a similar way.
Current complaints from stakeholders (including the aforementioned GTS Novera company) show that in all negotiations with operators many similar impediments are encountered.
Carrying responsibility on the ČTÚ is a fairly common trick in the field of telecommunications from which the ÚOHS washes its hands in all this matter.
We have already met him in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, a new amendment to the telecommunications law was recently submitted to expand the ČTÚ’s competition in the field of commercial tenders, which did not take effect, even when a number of specialists promised that the situation would improve.
This should be well-known to UOHS representatives, but it is obvious that their interests lie elsewhere.
Everything is fine when no one looks.
At the same time, unnoticedly continues to work something like a pseudovirtual operator that in the Czech mobile phone networks already exists a few.
They are companies that put their own prices on mobile phone services that, however, only part are public.
These are usually companies that are engaged in multi-level marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile services.
Usually only a few selected people get the price list of these companies.
The magic is that the company, with respect to the operator, acts as a classic business customer of the same ordering a lot of SIM cards.
As a special customer, you will receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that the business conditions at all Czech mobile operators prohibit this type of resale.
"If cases like those mentioned were discovered, we could talk about breach of contract terms that could result in the end of the collaboration with the given society," Martina Kemrová said.
But it is quite unlikely that an activity of this type carried out by mobile operators will not reach responsible people.
In the case of the three companies mentioned above, thousands of customers can be dealt with.
None of the operators are opposed to this procedure.
Through the activities of these companies they earn no negligible profits and, at the same time - unlike authentic virtual traders - in no way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns us of the possible problems: "the law allows for this kind of speculation, however, the services of this company are used only by a disproportionate percent of customers.
These, in addition, must accept that their phone’s SIM card is not in their name so they can’t possibly dispose of it as a regular customer of the operators.”
This is precisely what should seem to the ČTÚ at least strange.
There is also a new question for the UOHS.
If mobile operators are turning their eyes around in this type of procedure, why are they blocking the entrance of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that the UOHS has sufficient competence to discover this type of activity and if it is not going to want it, it should not be content with the operators' explanations that they have no idea of this story and that their commercial conditions do not allow it.
When will we stop being the most expensive?
As was already clear in the text, the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market brought a significant drop in the prices of services.
At the same time, virtually in every country where the virtual operator emerged, the classic operators tried to more or less protect themselves from this break-up.
The arguments used by these were virtually all identical – too small, a market eventually too saturated, problems with service quality, etc.
In the most advanced countries, however, at this time the regulatory bodies have intervened and in none of the cases defended the operators but their customers.
Whether with formal measures or informal pressure, they achieved the emergence of the first virtual operator and with it began to emerge others.
Unfortunately, the Czech Regulatory Body passes this whole case as if it were a burning clove.
By our experience we cannot fail to impress that the confusion of attributions in these cases suits them.
But let us not despair.
If this behind-the-scenes information is correct and the virtual operator actually arrives in these lands, then the Czech mobile market is probably starting to move again.
If any of the operators let some virtual mobile phone operator enter, it will be difficult for the UOHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And we may stop calling it more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four presentations of the new version of the official Czech anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the day of the official Czech celebrations presented the new official recording of the national anthem Where, my home.
The new anthem was recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - two versions that are Solos, one with male voice and another with female voice, another with Choir and another instrumental.
The song is performed by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the arrangements of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the server iHNed.cz you can listen to the four versions.
Bělohlávek considers this national Czech hymn to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
The Czech Radio said earlier that it intentionally chose singers with representatively young voices that are more expressive and popular.
“From the beginning I tried with the two and then, too, with the Choir to fix on the diction so that the text was well understood, so that it had consonance,” he said.
The Czech National Anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where, My Home sounded for the first time in the year 1834 on the tables of the Theatre of the States in the original Czech work Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl and arranged with the music of František Škroup.
It gained popularity and people made it theirs.
The first strofe of the song after the emergence of Czechoslovakia in 1918 became, naturally, a part of the official anthem.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" hymn sounds
Prague MHD takes us on Wednesday for the first time with the chip
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, the date is written into the history of the Prague Transport Company when the first passengers enter the metro, tram and bus with an electronic voucher in their pockets instead of a paper ticket.
It can now be purchased by 100,000 people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase the 30-day, 90-day and annual voucher (it will be valid from 1 January 2009) and simultaneously load it on their chip card at the transport company’s infocenters and stations at the Metro, Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka stations.
The bonds can be purchased on the internet on the pages of the transport company, www.dpp.cz.
The service, until the afternoon, was used by over 400 people.
Those who start using the internet as a form of trading can start to forget about the ticket stations at the metro stations, where until now they had to regularly catch a regular ticket.
The bonus is purchased on the internet, and the Opencard card is charged in one of the thirteen branches of the Municipal Library.
“In these places there is a window with prepared staff available to passengers that helps interested parties with online shopping and also with charging the voucher purchased on their card,” said Martin Opatrný, spokesman for the project.
Apart from the library, it will also be possible to recharge the electronic voucher on the Opencard on the dealer machines that are located in some metro halls.
How are these expenditure machines?
They are red, they remind us of a ticketing machine and travelers will probably have already looked at them at the metro stations of Roztyly, Budějovická, I.P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there are five in the city but by the end of the year there would have to be eighty," Opatrný added.
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
Using the machine, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
Just enter the Opencard chip card in it and the previously paid bonus will be charged only on it.
The electronic bonds from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, in circular trains and bus lines from the numbers 300 to 499 that are used mainly by inhabitants of central Bohemian towns.
“In the trains attached to Prague’s integrated transport there are reviewers equipped with a reader card that will help confirm the validity of the time and the zone of the voucher,” said Filip Drápal, the ticket control, of the Ropid organization that sets the timetables of Prague’s collective transport.
Circular buses have their reader cards mounted on the driver’s ticket box.
When entering it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but also it is necessary to accompany it with the Opencard in the place intended for this on the side of the Box.
The driver controls the validity of the ticket.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the bonuses there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," Drápal added.
Passengers who do not travel on the circular buses and do not remember when the ticket expires can go to the dealer machines where the cards are recharged.
Here, on the machine screen, you will be shown information about the validity of your document.
Southeast voted to join the United States in a referendum
The German Sudets asked in 1945 that Fumaba be part of the United States.
This is what is extracted from the letter that is stored in the collection of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we at least want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With this desire, presumably, some groups of Sudet Germans addressed the President of the United States in 1945.
It is derived from the letters that are kept in a private archive and are now stored in the collection of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans of Český Krumlov request in a letter to the American president not to allow the return of the "Skumava land" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Pact - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have correctly understood the situation and we really want your word that American units are coming to German lands not as oppressors or enemies but as liberators," the letter, signed with a "people who carry the fate of Šumava in their hearts."
In view of the fact that the union of Czechoslovakia with the Southeast Germans presumably implies – according to these the Czech national character – a hope only in brutality, disregard, incomprehension, pressure and slavery, the authors beg in the letter to the American president to assume for today and forever Šumava under a protectorate.
"We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of four million inhabitants we are handed over to a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and that in no way collaborates with the victory of the Allies," the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is presumably the fear of retaliation from the “Czech oppressors.”
If the U.S. president presumably doubted this idea of the Šumava Germans, it would be enough to organize in the Šumava lands a referendum on whether its inhabitants want to be part of the U.S. or live under its patronage.
Despite the fact that the text of the letter, with the current knowledge of post-war history, may sound a little childish, according to some specialists, paints the expectations of the Southeast Germans at the time.
Although the Czech Germans had to intuit at least that it was going to be about his expulsion from the republic, only a few admited this possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate for the Sudets some clear form of autonomy.
Others thought they would stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed even by Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
This was in the war, as a German of Budějovice, enrolled in the Baltic Navy.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and placed in the Holstein prison camp, dozens of Germans went to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they got home, the Czech would get them well," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, counted that on the basis of the Decrees of Benes would be removed from the Republic.
Don’t think – you pay!
Emotional Campaign Attacks Drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
This could be characterized by the emotional Campaign that the Ministry of Transport decided to launch on Wednesday in the media.
Minister’s office Aleš Řebíček promises to discourage drivers from dangerous conduct at the wheel.
The $150 million campaign will be featured on television, radio, movies, the internet and brochures.
It would have to deter the driver from high speed and alcohol at the wheel.
And also to remind them that before you get started you tie up the belts.
It wants to bring awareness especially to young drivers, motorists, pedestrians and, lastly, to professional drivers.
What can we see in the ads?
Basically human stories that embolden emotions.
And for this we are witnessed by the “bloody” ads throughout the campaign:
Don’t think – you pay!
The word "Don't think" is written in large letters on the sign.
And in a shed of blood is the word “pay”.
This should symbolize that man in a moment of disappointment can come to pay with his own life.
The ads will “fear” viewers until the year 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign in Anglo-Saxon lands where strong images of victims of accidents can be seen.
It promises that in this way it will reduce accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The announcement was made by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and sugar for drivers
“For drivers, the sugar and blade system is valid.
Sugar is for him when, for example, a red light is passed and thus saves time.
It is a threat of a fine or accident.
Drivers should be reminded of the risks,” says Na Homolce Hospital transport psychologist Martin Kořán.
And that is why an informative campaign in the press and mainly negative advertising is needed, the psychologist says.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of dangers.
"If there is any panel installed warning of any danger, it will probably soon fuse with the environment and the driver will not pay more attention to it," Kořán warned.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied areas in exchange for peace
The president of the Israeli provisional government, Ehud Olmert, spoke about the restitution of virtually all the lands occupied in 1967, that is, the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He proposed in the interview that Monday appeared in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that we must necessarily return almost all (occupied) lands if not all," Olmert told the newspaper.
“I’m sure we’ll keep a bit of this land, but to the Palestinians we’ll have to give a similar percentage (of Israel’s land) because without this there will be no peace,” he said.
He admitted that in the event of restitution it would also include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and therefore does not want tractors or excavators to pass over his legs as one of my best friends did, then he will have to hand over a portion of Jerusalem," Olmert said in reference to the two attacks in July in the city in which several people were killed and dozens were wounded.
According to the president, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Hill, a sacred and historic place" located inside the ancient city.
“He who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work,” he insisted later.
Retreat from the Golan Heights
Olmert also called for Israel’s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which from his point of view is an inherent condition for closing a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also require concrete efforts from Damascus.
"I am not proposing to close peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal of the Golan," he said.
“The Syrians know well what they will have to get rid of to win the Golan.
They must abandon their current relations with Iran, they must abandon their relations with Hezbollah (the Chita movement), they must get rid of the permanent support that provokes terrorism from Hamas (the Chita movement), Al Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," he said.
Questions after the accident: Are shuttles in buses illegal?
The law is unknown, you cannot walk on a long-distance bus
In connection with the tragic accident of the Student Agency bus company near the Italian city of Padova, the question arises whether the shelters and passengers can move on the bus during the trip.
“If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of the sheriff is contrary to the road traffic law,” said Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in which the twenty-two-year-old was killed last week was obviously caused by the truck driver only that the bus crossed the road.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the less secure place in the vehicle despite having two other seats reserved.
However, the bus can have an accident or brake suddenly, and at the exact moment when the trader shares the coffee or the newspapers.
Here what plays the role is if the bus is equipped, according to the technical permit, with places to walk.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must sit.
Student Agency long-distance buses do not have places to walk, as confirmed by the company’s director, Radim Jančura, to Aktuálně.cz.
“We have resolved this with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally, they withdrew it and we reached an agreement that passengers can go to the bathroom while the bus is running if they have a seat," he said.
The police do not know the law.
"There is no obvious legal interpretation of the role of the wardrobe - no legal provision clarifies this function.
Not even any legal provision prohibits transport agents from performing any service.
The road transport law only knows the term Vehicle Revisor, whose rights and obligations are not defined," adds, less sharply, the spokesman Hanzelka.
The director of the Department of Road Vehicle Traffic of the Ministry of Transportation, Josef Pokorný, on the contrary, thinks that the law sufficiently addresses this problem.
“It depends on whether the bus has the approval permitted to have pedestrian sites.
That’s all,” he says.
Buses are divided between urban, where there are places to be standing and maximum speed limited, interurban with places to be standing with a higher speed permit and those of long distances without places to be standing, with the highest speed permit and with seats equipped with seat belts.
As in the aircraft, says the expert
BESIP’s Transportation Safety expert Jaroslav Hořín sees no major problems with the movement of the bus driver.
"During the development of the trip there is not much threat of danger, the situation can be compared to the service on airplanes.
Not even here is there the certainty that the turbulence will come and that the messenger can be hit in the head."
“H, if the bus brakes suddenly obviously the laws of physics are valid.
Same as on a city bus or in the tram.
The safety of the carrier must be solved by the internal regulation of the carrier," he says and also thinks that from the point of view of the law this problem is unsolved.
Jančura is prepared to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only carrier that offers the catering service.
Employs two hundred.
The director, even after the accident, considers this job risky.
“H, as soon as I have the impression that the job is at risk, then I will remove it.
Coffee and newspapers can receive it, passengers, when entering.
It would even save costs,” he says.
In safety interest is the reason Asiana lacks shutters on its vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, who runs a small line compared to SA.
“We don’t have shots, we’ve been against them from the beginning.
Sooner or later this will end in a fatal accident," he told Týden.cz less than a year ago.
There was a huge tragedy.
In the accident of the line that connects Naples died a young assailant from Pilsen who had worked for the company for two years.
A Slovenian truck that probably turned from the parking lane blocking the passage to the bus.
His driver tried in a quick manoeuvre to avoid him, however, he collided with the right front.
Jančura denies that the two sites that are reserved for the guest’s rest were sold.
"These sites are not possible to reserve them for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company intends to sue the truck driver.
The agency will not wait for the verdict of the trial on the compensation of the girl's family but expects the financial expenses also on the part of the culprit.
Reform of the law?
No, for now
The reform of the law could bring greater precision on the movement of the bus driver in which for a year they are working thirty experts members of a group of the Ministry of Transport.
"H, they have not come to any concrete conclusions.
They don’t dedicate too much to buses, but rather to the point system, maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones during the journey,” says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the shelters something that significantly threatens the safety of passengers," Hanzelka said, concluding that the control of the safety in buses is the competence of the police and the Office of Safety at work.
Dusseldorf's hope stands in Frankfurt
In the letter from the board of directors of the West LB bank to its collaborators there are no big words.
By the merger of the units of the Dusseldorf bank with the DEKA bank, a ‘central capital market of the Sparkassen financial group’ can be formed, as the letter says, published on Monday.
The West LB bank, breaking the 'block of competition' with sustainable profit capacity would enter such a business.
Furthermore, such a merger can be a start for subsequent mergers within the scope of regional banks.
This is how the text is understood, when a board of directors wants to show ability to act in tough times.
Because like before, the West LB is under enormous pressure.
Not only from the European Union, but also from the Federal Financial Services Surveillance Institute, which recently made it clear to the government of North Rhine-Westphalia that there is little time left to find a solution.
For some time now, also on the part of Frankfurt, there has been a lot of talk about such a union between the DEKA bank, which Sparkasse customers know for its investment funds, and the West LB.
To say the truth, Franz Waas, the head of DEKA bank, presenting the data after half a year at the end of August said that he sees no sense in the merger of the bank, located on Mainzer Straße, with a regional bank such as Helaba or the West LB.
But the board of directors of DEKA, which is now made up of regional banks and Sparkassen associations, commissioned the board to start negotiations with the West LB on common business activities.
This could be a business in the capital market or parts of it.
Of course, the negotiations have just begun, so it says on the financial site.
It is not the first time when it comes to the consolidation in the field of Sparkassen that the name of the DEKA bank appears that with its 3000 collaborators is among the most important entrepreneurs in the financial site Frankfurt.
In 2003 at one point the situation seemed so that DEKA could merge with the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and with the Helaba.
This initiative to create a three-party union was unsuccessful.
As soon as the plans were made public, the Hesse government expressed opposition to Helaba's participation in this project.
The other two banks also did not find the same language.
Instead, the Rhine-Palatinate regional bank began dialogue with the Baden-Württemberg regional bank.
But it was always played again with the idea of merging the DEKA bank with other regional banks.
But finally Günther Merl, the chairman of the Helaba board, expressed that he was against the plans for coexistence with his bank.
Regardless of that it seems to be more clear that the union of the different banks of public law is necessary.
When the Bavarian parliamentary elections are to take place, the union of the BayernLB with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg could make progress.
For the Helaba this is not necessarily a good news.
If the pressure to continue merging increases, Helaba will lack partners to do that.
In the south the bank could only be a young partner, although until now it stood out much better than the financial crisis that the Stuttgart and Munich real estate did.
On the other hand, the Hesse-Turingia Sparkassen- und Giroverband, which owns 85 percent of the Helaba, at the beginning of the year avoided plans for coexistence with the West LB.
In any case, only the Nord LB remains.
But such geostrategic reflections form are only one part.
This is due to the compatibility of different banking systems.
In June Merl made a fundamental question about a business model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, to which the Deutsche Sparkassen- und Giro-Verband has so far given no answer.
In the end, you can break down the West LB, but that, of course, is not the bank’s own desire.
Thus, also in the letter of the board of directors of the bank it is said that it would try to find a complete solution for the entire bank
As you can combine the coexistence between singular parts of the bank with the DEKA, that will show time.
The second weekend of the Oktoberfest is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
For Elena, it’s the first time, for Luca, the third or fourth time.
But this time, he is assisted by Elena as his girlfriend, and that’s why everything looks different, he says.
Behind them, next to a 5 litre barrel of Kaiser brand beer is built a huge tiger bear that shows 200 Oktoberfest participants that low sounds know how to produce in their throat.
First Elena gives Luca a palm, then a kiss.
From Bologna they arrived in Verona.
From there, from the parking lot next to the Porta Nuova train station, three buses depart tonight at 23:45, ` direction Munich, the beer party', expected to arrive at 6:30 in the morning.
Three buses are planned mainly for Italians, one bus is only for Brazilians.
In one of the corners of the parking lot next to their flag are singing the South Americans, they had already begun to celebrate at night.
With a lot of noise, says Marco Guarda, which is nothing for the Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with an artificial leather coat and glasses with silver patillas, owns these buses.
For five years they have come to the Oktoberfest, considering that only this year there are three excursions.
At night on the way there, during the day in the prairie, at 22.30 the turn.
Spending the night there means only unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome reception with a Kaiser beer that was made under the law of Bavarian purity, sickness insurance and the guide in German- Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
At night the buses are already on the road on the highway with the direction "Brennero"
There is no beer, not yet.
Soon the calm reigns on the bus, the passengers are asleep.
It’s okay, they’ll still need the forces.
Stop at Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with the Italian ticket make another stop on Highway 8 shortly before Munich.
Finally, when Marco’s group is scheduled to arrive at 6.30 in the morning at the parking lot next to Prado de Teresa, there are about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others meet, Marco has his last speech on how to proceed.
Put on a yellow hat.
There, on the left side is written "Oktoberfest", next to the Gothic letter is the page of Marco's travel office on the internet: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: “When the doors of the store of the campaign open, that means march!” cries Marco in the morning.
"March!"March and occupy the back seats in the campaign store.
“Don’t take the seats in front, because we’re going to block, and all with yellow hats don’t sit on the same bench, spread across the space!”
A liter of beer, Ruge Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
Do not forget the propination
Show the security people that we have a good tone!
As soon as he leaves his place, he will be occupied!”
Third: “This afternoon exactly at ten and a half you have to come here!”
Everyone is going to the Oktoberfest.
One, to mark the way, puts yellow hats on trees, traffic signs and even on a poster of the elections of a large Bavarian People's Party.
You want to be able to recognize the way back.
It is the second weekend of the Oktoberfest that is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
There are no exact data on the number of people; it is 50,000 people who make the trip over the Alps and stormily enter the camp shops, 10 percent of all came especially this weekend from Italy.
Munich police are assisted by seven police officers from the autonomous province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers help the Bavarian Red Cross that makes a statistic of the nations present, where the Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, ahead of the English (nearly 60 assistance) and the Austrians occupy the first place.
The favourite shop of the Italian campaign is so called Hofbräuzelt.
No-Sleep Nights for Hypo Real Estate Creditors
Germany’s banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peter Steinbrück said last week.
Well, the politician used the word "relatively" and added that the German banking sector will also be affected by the critical trends.
And that happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), Munich’s real estate financier, which is listed on the DAX index, receives from a consortium of German banks a billion-dollar loan to be able to resist turbulence in the market.
On Monday, a person familiar with the situation told Reuters that the credit aid amounted to up to €35 billion.
The share of the capital that Hypo Real Estate will use has to cast interest.
Money comes from private banks as well as public banks.
The cause of that are the losses of the Depfa subsidiary.
According to a report, state financiers with the money that was borrowed for long-term projects financed them only for a short period – which now, due to distrust in the markets, is no longer possible.
In the first half of the year, the bank’s cash capital reserve fell by 95 percent, 2.37 million euros, and the share of own capital delayed from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Compared to the same period last year, continuous income from financial investments and net profit from financial transactions fell to zero, debtor imputation revenues and some securities and those from the dissolution of provisions of credit tended to fall by more than 70 percent, by 5 million euros.
Only thanks to the high and large revenues from the repayments of the compensation costs of the former Depfa group’s restructuring as well as the repayment of interest under the federal tax code and organized for the consortium’s companies, the negative balance could charge a deficit by approximately 16 percent more.
After its privatization in the year 1990 the former state financier was at first lost in speculation with industrial loans for real estate, which served as a reason for the foundation of the Aareal bank.
As much money could not be earned from the financing of state projects, the Defa began to focus intensively on infrastructure projects and the financing of community projects by private and state investors (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and diversified.
Now Hypo Real Estate has to make amortizations on the value of the subsidiary that will have an “essential material effect” on the group’s consolidated loss and profit account, it is said very inaccurately.
The dividends have been cancelled.
By 2007, two-thirds of them were cancelled.
After the acquisition of Depfa, Hypo Real Estate became a major state-owned financial and infrastructure sector.
Since the bank does not own the client deposits, it, compared to other banks, turns out to be more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market.
With the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers, which happened two weeks ago, interbank lending was essentially down because banks were saving their liquidity.
Every year, Hypo Real Estate needs €50 billion to fund a portion of Defa’s credit portfolios of its short-term refinancing measures.
According to the Hypo Real Estate report, the bank covers with a loan the need for group financing for a short time and the company is insured of “the influence of international monetary markets that are now essentially unfit to function.”
Other sources say that thanks to this money the refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, the chairman of the board of directors of Hypo Real Estate, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not need the money markets for the foreseeable time.
The German central bank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services Supervision (BaFin) are based on the assumption that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group from now on is assured.
That’s what the bank’s shareholders and creditors have to expect.
But due to the dynamics and the imposderability of the crisis there is no constancy.
It is even conceivable that there is no need for funding in its full volume.
However, the opposite cannot be ruled out.
It was rumored that in the last hour of Sunday the bank was still almost insolvent, so the temporary bailout can not reassure at least worried people.
The share price dropped to 75 percent, 3.30 euros.
Loans, on the contrary, are really good.
While priority debts hardly change, loan rates according to position in the property register clearly tend to go down.
The loans of the former Württemberg subsidiary Hypo are mostly affected, and the loans of which are due to exceed their due date in 2009.
After the notable growth of the banking crisis and the acquisition of the Depfa that affected the Hypo Real Estate, the current value of its loans that were previously an investment for speculation must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
While issuing banks, governments and banks that are slightly affected are still ready to support the system, in the meantime you can start with retirement depreciation in time.
Or something will happen, which no one can imagine – the financial crisis will overcome in the next 15 months.
But by seeing the cross-news about partial statization, now security that is already at its limit has become a justified hope.
That’s going to be a reason, because creditors will spend nights without sleep, breaking their heads over the decision about their isolation of enthusiasm.
Still short-term investors can put the end point and use the transfer to new account of losses for upcoming tax payments to compensate for the change gains in the future.
Sylvana and the Secrets of Bent
When the first day Sylvana Hiltrop, a 16-year-old girl, had to show up at the High School in Tachibana, the girls began to laugh: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word Mangas - in a report on the exchanges she tells Japan.
My first day at a school in Japan.
I felt nervous.
Before I went to school, I was scared.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in Kawasaki direction and go 40 minutes by train to Highschool Tachibana.
I had to find my way, fortunately I didn’t get lost.
It seems that the beginning of the classes is not as rigorously fixed as in my home, in Lower Saxony.
From eight in the morning come the students, at nine less twenty begins a small meeting with the teachers, the 'home room'.
Before the class started, I had to introduce myself.
In addition, I am not a person who speaks with much pleasure in the public, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As they still have the school uniform, I put on an old suit from my mother’s host family and also a blouse, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Well, so dressed I put myself on the pulpit and tried to pronounce everything correctly: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - my name is Sylvana, I am from Germany and in a week it will be my birthday.
I was very happy at this time because I had already started studying this language two years ago.
All 31 girls in the class have chewed, laughed and made signs and all the time I’ve heard the word “kawaii”
I knew her from my hands.
That belongs to the survival vocabulary of Japanese girls and means "mona, beautiful"
Then I quickly slipped into my place.
The girl next to her had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the exchange girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was quite quiet, but when the gong sounded, I felt really overwhelmed.
They all spoke at the same time, laughed and asked a lot of questions – at the same time it is very difficult to understand Japanese English.
In the afternoon, everybody took out their blossoms.
My host family’s mother also made a Lanchbox for me – it’s something else than boring German pieces of bread.
It had rice with herbs, small sausages, pepper salad and algae, fruit and something like tofu meat.
In most cases, I have no idea what is like here in Japan.
Things are rare and have a new taste.
What is certain is that everything is very rich.
Well, maybe with the exception of pears marinated in salt, bufff!
In Japanese schools, bento is not just a lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl prepares a blessing made in a very artistic way for a boy and gifts it to him in the hope of getting to know him better during a play.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I’m curious to see if I can see it here too.
“Why exactly Japan?” my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend a year of school.
He always replied:
“Because it fascinates me.”
For years, I have preferred to read books.
To be able to understand comics and culture better, one day I started studying a little bit of Japanese.
For me it was absolutely certain that one day I would travel there.
Also because I have a weakness for tradition and customs.
They have a great value here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand it is a strict, disciplined and traditional country.
As everything is well organized, I still didn’t feel lost here even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen in my life.”
Even rats have emotions.
It is said that a rat or a cockroach feeling danger flees, why is he also afraid?
Joseph Le Doux, the neuroscientist, is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can we control if they, behaving in the same way as us, feel the same?
In an internet magazine called "Edge" for many years the contributions of famous scientists are published.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the selected answers to the question What do you think is true without being able to prove it?
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness that I or anyone else could not test so far, although we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case at least we can expect it because all human brains present the same fundamental configuration.
But as soon as we devote ourselves to other species and include questions about sensation and in general about consciousness, we enter the unknown realm because the hardware doesn’t match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as other animals: it becomes dead, flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from which some scientists draw conclusions on comparable subjective experience.
Of course I do not believe it.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to contain our subjective experience to that of animals.
First, they almost always include the circuits associated with human consciousness of the lateral prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex (due to their participation in short memory and in executive functions that direct behavior).
This wide part is much more developed in the case of humans than that of the other primates and seems to be absent absolutely in other creatures.
Taking into account at least the aspects referred to our consciousness that depends on the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex, including knowledge about who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to assume that even man differs from other primates.
Another peculiarity lies in man’s linguistic nature: Since most of his experience is united with language, it often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals can be excluded.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, it would influence it in such a way that the consciousness of animals, created anyway, in many cases would differ from most of our states of consciousness.
This is why it is difficult to explain how the consciousness of other animals works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, is neither measured because it has the special hardware, nor is it analyzed through our experiences, so your research presents us big problems.
Most of my interventions refer to the content of conscious experience, but at the same time there is also another aspect of consciousness that would have to be easier for scientific research.
Animal consciousness processes could be investigated without considering their contents, and that’s what happens during primate short memory studies, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, the essence goes more to the neutral correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: The two can be similar or not.
Interestingly, this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex for the formation of visualization.
What does that mean for the sensations?
I owe it to the fact that in the emotional system a part of the brain is activated that is responsible for that, the same as happens with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a mental state in which we are when brain activity occupies a space of the defense system (or its consequences such as body reactions).
From this point of view, the sensations are very fixed apart from the cerebral cortex, which distinguishes primates and especially humans.
From the point of view of the linguistic nature follow classifications of fine sensations because we can differentiate and classify states with the help of words and grammar to be able to describe the states of others alongside ourselves.
For example, Antonio Damasco, on the contrary, thinks that sensations derive from the simple activities of the parts of the cerebral cortex responsible for bodily feelings and of the brain trunk, the same thinks Jaak Pankseep, but focuses more on the brain trunk.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can refer absolutely to different types and their sensations.
For theoretical reasons I cannot go against that, but I consider it unlikely.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel as fear, possibly that feels in two cases also like this: But how can you control if rats and men behaving in a similar way feel the same?
Seeing the danger a cockroach runs away, then why is he afraid?
I am of the opinion that the similarity of behavior does not yet prove the similarity of experience.
That’s true that neuronal comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain trunks, cockroaches on the contrary don’t have at least one brain.
Is the trunk of the brain responsible for sensations?
Even if it is possible to test it for men: How can it be tested in the case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, possibly also cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
I don’t know how you can prove it.
I prefer to investigate rats’ emotional behavior than emotional sensations because their sensations are supposedly fundamentally different from us (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and language).
In any case, here progress is expected in the field of neurology while measuring the same of rats and men.
Since I don’t investigate the language and consciousness of rats, as well as sensations, I don’t know if they exist.
You can say I can’t see beyond my nose, but I’d rather move forward than work permanently with no results.
I am a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: Deadline for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said the preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees the UEFA decision in Bordeaux as a test of confidence in Ukraine's ability to organize the European Championship together with Poland," Wasjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
Now the work is about to begin and there is a lot to be done in both countries.”
The timetable for the construction and reconstruction of the stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in the host countries is rough.
The number of stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
“We cannot waste more time.
Now we have to carry out work at great speed," said the president of a Ukrainian association Grigorij Surkis.
“UEFA will not take our eyes away from us.”
In Poland, a more radical step was agreed.
After numerous scandals, the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish association PZPN and replaced it with independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of Sport Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "a serious danger that the PZPN is unable to follow the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
“In a letter we assured UEFA President Platini that the preparation for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer from that.”
Only in the last season many clubs of the First Division were condemned due to manipulation in descent to the lower category, finally also the division council had to be postponed.
Dennis Quaid outraged
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in an interview about private life- and has problems with her ex-husband: Hollywood star Meg Ryan designated her ex-husband as an adulteress.
They get angry and counterattack.
The delayed war of the two roses in the former couple of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Eight years after their divorce the two Hollywood actors publicly show an unpleasant fight between them.
Last week in an interview with the American magazine InStyle Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for the failure of marriage: "Dennis was long unfaithful to me, and that was very painful."
She knew the size of her infidelity only after divorce.
The reason for the revelation of private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" - it tells a story of the failure of a marriage.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to the designation of him as an unfaithful husband was clear: “This is unheard of how many times Meg tells the story of our relationship in another version,” the 54-year-old man told New York Daily News.
Among other things it’s very “lamentable” that Jack, his 16-year-old son, again “will publicly recall the pain and changes, all that means a divorce for a child.”
While Ryan lives alone after divorce, Quaid is again married and has recently been a twin dad.
And so he ends his statements by highlighting: “Well, my life continues.
I feel happy because I have a wonderful family that’s fine.”
Flight and hotel ticket prices are falling.
In the first half of 2008, airline tickets and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper compared to last year.
According to a current study, airline tickets in Germany have become even 50 percent cheaper.
Flight tickets and overnight stays in hotels again became inexpensive - these are the results of a study by the travel and financial services provider of American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and after the price rise in the first quarter found out a major change in the second half.
After for many years prices in the hotel market continued to rise, overnight stays in many locations became cheap.
Compared to last year, between January and March, prices in 41 of the 48 different cities in Europe increased on average to 6.9 percent.
From April to June, prices have already dropped to 3.6 percent compared to last year.
Trends were more noticeable in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for this was the weakened dollar exchange rate, which was the cause that “the interests of American tourists in travel declined.”
The decline in hotel prices is also much more noticeable in financial centers such as Frankfurt or London than in industrial concentration points such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices rose to 26.3 percent and thus beat a record in Europe.
In the first quarter, airline ticket prices also showed upward trends:
Due to the rise in the price of kerosene, Economy-class travellers had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-haul flights even made up to 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, the prices of the Economy class airline tickets, compared to the previous quarter, dropped on average to 12.5 percent, but the price changes for the Businessclass and Firstclass were small.
In Germany the change in prices was more noticeable than in other European countries:
From January to February prices rose to 11.9, in the second half dropped to 23.6 percent.
According to a study, prices for domestic flights in Germany even decreased by half.
The cause of the price change is on the one hand the rise of the flood economy, explains the company.
In many parts of the air travel market, demand is falling.
The Open Skies Treaty liberalizes air traffic between the United States and Europe.
The signal of the tense situation is the cancellation of non-profit long-distance flights on airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 declared bankruptcy - only in Europe there were 24 airlines.
HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, the Hamburg SV becomes the leader.
Luhukay of Borussia to him still does not go to make the tenth goal.
Kristoffer Klein presented very well the forced landing of national team player Marko Martin.
Gladbach's player started playing late and failed to score a goal.
Everything he wanted to say exactly in reaction to what had happened, he could read clearly from his lips.
I only knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," Hermann Rieger whispered at the cabin entrance of the Hamburg stadium.
Nothing special happened in the catacombs, the rest time ended and most of the present were again in their sites.
Rieger was a physiotherapist of HSV for almost three decades, enjoying a great reputation as one of those who formed a part of the group.
That is why his request was noticed by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol, the assistant coach, shrugged his head and raised his fingers as a sign of approval.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, Hamburg's head coach.
His order was the same: the second goal!
But that was not accomplished.
"Today it wasn't all pleasant to see," Marcell Jansen added afterwards.
Also Bastian Reinhard had wished to have him “more relaxed.”
The result 1:0 (1:0) Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petric (11) for his head impact; and also to the situation that the very weak Gladbach team could not show all its strength to the weak Hamburg team.
“That was a dirty victory,” said Martin Jol.
The Hamburg SV will be 121 years old this Monday.
On Saturday will be the spectators had already celebrated their own, the blue sky over the stadium and the change of board on the video screen.
It would be a birthday without a celebration.
“We know how to interpret it,” Marcell Jansen said.
It foresees that the partial rating of the table corresponds more to the velacy of the league than to the dominance of its HSV.
The chip with his compelled players late as the Brazilians Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen who was removed from FC Bayern need time to get together, but still the chip can’t shine with their successes.
“We need more of the feeling and the dribbling,” Jol demands.
After the vote defeat
Fear is spreading on Wall Street.
The first news of the failure of the bank rescue package dropped Down Jones to 700 points for a certain period.
That was the biggest loss of points in one day in its history.
The Dow Jones has recovered a bit.
At 20:30 a.m., one of the world’s most important stock barometers quoted a 5 percent deficit in 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq, the electronic stock market, lost more than seven percent and stood at 1,458 points.
At this time the biggest losers on the Dow Jones were American Express that lost 14 percent and Bank of America with a loss of 12 percent.
No title could win in value.
Goldmann Sachs shares lost 10 percent.
Only a few days ago a great investor Warren Buffet had financially participated in the company.
The bailout plan envisages making available resources to buy so-called "ridden" mortgage shares.
But the amount will be paid by blow but step by step.
As compensation for that, the state has to receive stock option receipts for financial partnerships that during the course development can be charged to reduce the financial burden on the state fund.
Stock prices in Europe and the US continue to fall
Billion-dollar aid to banks in Europe and the U.S. does not reassure investors.
The share price of the major German bank Hypo Real Estate drops and negatively influences the Dax.
Despite the redemption of the financial market projected by the state, the U.S. Dow Jones index continues to fall.
Losses from the speculated shares of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank caused the German index (Dax) to fall into a large deficit.
Despite rescue actions on the part of the federal government and private banks, the stock of the Munich real estate financier for a period of time lost two-thirds of its value, the Comerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
The Dax dropped clearly below the psychological limit of 6000 points and quoted a deficit of 3.7 percent in 5,839 units.
Worldwide financial markets have suffered a decline.
The opening day of Wall Street in New York began with remarkable losses.
Investors fear the US government’s $700 billion bailout package will not be enough to boost financial markets.
In the first hour after the opening, the Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10.809,25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the bailout, the Senate vote could be on October 1.

Dark matter influences the trajectory of the spacecraft
For many years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused the researchers to be confused: Dark Matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational assistance to the manoeuvre.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s Theory of Relativity cannot be so correct.
The "Ulysses" spacecraft spent almost 18 years flying in the universe.
Because the fuel pipes are freezing now threatens you a death in the cold.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon, the anomaly during gravitational assistance to the manoeuvre, has caused confusion among researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a manoeuvre of the trajectory of the spacecraft during which they obtain an acceleration using the energy of the gravitational field of a planet, such as Earth.
This allows the spacecraft to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American spacecraft, used this physical trick as did the Ulysses Sun probe.
But what surprised researchers for many years: Missiles don’t behave 100 percent as expected under the venerable law of gravitation.
There are frequent irregularities of speed.
Improvisedly, the probes have greater or lesser speed.
Physicists have not yet been able to explain this effect.
They called it the anomaly during gravitational assistance to the manoeuvre.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein’s General Relativity Theory describing the force of attraction of matter by the curvature of space cannot be so correct.
Stephen Adler, the American physicist at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, now solemnly believes as before that Einstein did not confuse and tries to explain the anomaly during gravitational assistance with the help of so-called Dark Matter, in what remained astronomers in the universe.
"The reason for the anomaly may be dark matter that can also be very close to Earth," he writes.
Universe researchers have known about the existence of dark matter only for ten years.
It is supposed to possess the force of attraction and its influence can be observed on other planets.
Dark matter, on the other hand, is completely invisible, meaning it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to scientists, dark matter makes up at least a fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Turists Abducted in Egypt Are Free
As confirmed by the Italian foreign minister, after spending ten days in the hands of the kidnappers, the tourists abducted in Egypt should be released.
The kidnappers of Sudan had demanded millions of the rescue.
Six kidnappers must be killed in a shooting during the release.
Five Germans are abducted in southern Egypt.
The rescue negotiations have already begun.
The Germans are always again at the attention of the hijackers.
The newspaper WELT ONLINE tells about the most important cases.
European tourists abducted in the Sahara have been released.
The same information is by Egyptian state television, the Arab television station Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
After news about the release on the Italian broadcaster Sky TG 24, Franco Frattini, Italian Foreign Minister, confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages are released.
“Now we control his health,” Frattini said.
Five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian escorts, are well and safe, state television.
The 19 participants of the desert expedition are on their way to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible are the reasons for a shooting before the hostages were released: According to the descriptions of an Egyptian security guard, the hijackers were ready to end the kidnapping, but the Sudanese army had suddenly killed six hijackers.
“The problem has been solved.
They agreed to the rescue," the guard said.
It was just about “receiving the hostages” when suddenly came “this surprise.”
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers killed six kidnappers and arrested two of them at the border between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers have demanded the rescue of Germany in the amount of six million euros; the money was to deliver the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom", referring to a German mediator, that the release was delayed because the kidnappers feared their safety.
According to the report, the hijackers intend to release the female hostages after receiving the rescue.
The men had to be stopped until the hijackers had a safe route to escape.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to take a position on the report.
Abuse of father-in-law “leads to suicide”
According to the court, years of abuse by her father-in-law led a woman to kill herself.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after admitting eight charges of indecent assault.
The Royal Court of Truro, through an investigative study, found that he had regularly tied his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote on a confession paper: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court found that Mrs. Randle committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
In the season when the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to tie her and grind her eyes before carrying out her sexual acts, while her mother was working in a pub.
After divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to live in Cornwall.
His daughter moved to Plymouth.
However, the court found that Mrs Randle, who spent much of her time working as a volunteer for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse she had been inflicted twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife referred to the court what some friends of Ms. Rande had said of her, that after being a great surfer and cyclist, she now seemed “emotionally dead,” as if she had “resigned to life.”
In April 2007, his real father, Terraza Randle, found the woman dead in his Plymouth apartment.
Ms. Rande is believed to have killed herself by suffocating with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter’s father-in-law, who wrote a letter of confession that concludes by saying, “I used to tie her and blow her eyes.
It was never a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen replied to Trerise: "You are a very strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been a terrifying experience, especially when you were only seven years old.
This unpleasant saga ends with the victim taking her own life.
Even clearer, it is that if she had not done so, the matter would probably not have ended in the courts."
He added: “I’ve noticed the effect that, according to the description made by Stephanie’s father and mother, the abuse has had on her daughter over the years.
Clearly she could have had a promising, successful and happy future.”
Officer charged with data loss
The BBC was informed that a cabinet official who forgot some secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on a work trip by the Ministry of Defense, abandoned two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were passed on to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It is the least serious charge under the law and does not imply any indication of the intention to delinquent.
BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the sentence had come as a surprise for many in the British administration.
“They thought it was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defense and the Cabinet,” he said.
The employee, who cannot be named, is charged under Section 8.1 of the Law, the clause referring to the safeguarding of information.
The Royal Legal Service noted that the official should be charged by the Metropolitan Police, because of the highly sensitive entity of his work in the Secret Service Committee.
The forgotten documents contained secret information about al-Qaeda and the capabilities of the security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision on Monday morning and immediately moved from his home to a secret place.
Construction companies face the price of B&B
In Britain, construction companies could face a price of more than £80,000 after the rescue / rescue of the bank Bradford and Bingley.
The government, in fact, provided £14 trillion to protect the deposits of the bank’s 2.6 million savers.
Interest on the loan will be paid by all companies that use the money of the savers, including the 59 construction companies.
Director-General of the Association of Construction Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers “humiliating” that societies and their members have to pay
Eventually, the $14 trillion loan should be repaid after Bradford and Bingley’s mortgages are redeemed.
However, the interest that is earned in the interim, is supposed to be charged each year to the 700 financial companies that have deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan confirmed to the BBC that all 59 construction companies are included in that number.
It is humiliating that institutions that acted prudently ... are called today to pay the price of institutions that have been much less prudent.
by Adrian Coles, BSA
That is, each of the companies had to pay in proportion to the bank deposits, and that the mediation societies had to pay approximately 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will reach £450,000 in 2009.
This means that companies will have to recover £81,000 to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, general director of the Commercial Association of Construction Societies, told the BBC that this situation is unfair.
“It is humiliating that institutions that behaved prudently in the growth of the real estate market are called to pay the price produced by those that were much less prudent.”
According to the BSA, there are no data indicating the failure of any company since 1945.
“We will need to examine all aspects of this matter in the coming weeks to find out what options exist to protect construction companies and their members from what could be a relevant price,” Cole added.
The interest earned in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September of this year until March.
In 2010, it will be a full year of payable interest, which can be almost twice as much.
Being mutually organized and having no shareholders, its members will inevitably end up paying the price, either through higher rates or lower interest on their savings.
Milk prices rise by five pence per liter
Jersey residents will have to pay more for their milk.
The newspaper Jersey Dairy has announced that the highest price of dairy products will rise by an extra five pence the liter from next Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after an increase of two pence in February and followed by research carried out by a consulting firm.
Traders can decide for themselves if they want to apply price increases to their customers.
The last time the price of milk had increased the most before February was in 2002.
Bangladesh's former prime minister denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected the application for bail-free release for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in the sense that she could be taken to jail when she returned to her country.
His defenders said the court did not grant him bail-free by accusing him of extortion of 50 million taka ($729,700) to a businessman when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of several corruption charges against him.
His longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released under bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina's return to Bangladesh is expected in the coming weeks, but his party, the Awami League, has demanded that the country's military-supported government grant him first full freedom.
Correspondents say that while she was given conditional freedom to go abroad and receive medical treatment, it is not clear now what the terms of her release are or whether she will be able to remain in freedom when she returns to Bangladesh.
Their lawyers say they will appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected the request for bail-free release for Sheikh Hasina, arguing that he could not get bail-free because he was already under treatment abroad under conditional freedom," his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
“We are going to appeal against the Supreme Court order.”
Her advocates argued that she needed bail-free to return to her country from abroad and prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina should return to his homeland after October 17, according to a leader of the Awami League on Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the provisional government, backed by the army, took power, but was released in June to go abroad and receive medical treatments.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all charges they are accused of.
Campaign against polio in Afghanistan
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan – says the UN – have not been able to take advantage of a recent polio vaccination campaign due to the violence of the Taliban.
Last week the United Nations carried out a vaccine program in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports it was unable to reach the children in some parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for safety reasons.
A UN spokesman said it happened despite promises made by the Taliban that they would not attack or hinder thousands of officials while carrying out the vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal challenge at ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge in the Competition Commission after the decision forcing the company to reduce its stake in rival ITV broadcasting.
BSkyB has been informed by the Competition Appeal Court that it will have to reduce its share of 17.9% in ITV below 7.5%.
Earlier, the Commission said BSkyB’s interests hindered competition and allowed its unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought its stock in 2006 in a deal that effectively blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Anti-Monopoly Office that the acquisition of ITV’s stake by BSkyB raised doubts about ITV’s independence, and urged the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
Everyone, including Virgin chief Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and regulator Ofcom opposed the purchase.
BSkyB, commented that forcing it to reduce its ITV package was unreasonable and constituted a disproportionate remedy, because, BSkyB said, it would have given up its voting rights.
New investigation into the assumption of American lawyers
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the dismissal of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the Justice Department inspector-general criticized the conduct by administration officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former General Producer Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by fears that lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy is investigating whether officials questioned during the investigation lied to investigators in an attempt to hinder justice.
"Serious allegations of potential criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved," Attorney General Glenn Bellas said in the report.
One of the report’s main recommendations was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to leave their statements.
The discussion began when nine U.S. lawyers were removed from their posts by the Justice Department in December 2006.
At that time, the department motivated the decision by suggesting that the lawyers had been fired for low performance.
But later it became known that the lawyers had not rated themselves worse than other colleagues, and many observers led to the conclusion that the dismissals would be motivated by political reasons.
Some of the lawyers in question had worked on the prosecution of Republicans, high-profile members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of electoral fraud against the Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and prosecute judicial cases for the government
They can be dismissed at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The next head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure from the dismissals, resigned from his position.
A number of other Justice Department officials did the same.
The Attorney General’s report is very critical of Mr. Gonzales’s role in the matter, and stresses how he had a “primary responsibility” for the dismissals, who “abdicated” from his leadership position and was “notoriously non-collaborative” in the process.
Other officials, including former Bush collaborator Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The Meat Loaf epic of great honor
Rock star Meat Loaf will be honored at the Q Awards for her epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will collect the special prize next week at the ceremony in London, said getting this recognition would be "an honor."
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of Meat Loaf's 1977 album.
The Coldplay group are leading the nominations for this year’s awards and making the ranking of the four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: “There are some songs that transcend time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is one of them.”
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires an excellent vocal ability like that used by Meat Loaf.
An instrumental section of almost two minutes opens the anthem.
The song was first known as a single in the UK in 1979 and became number 15 in the ranking.
However, Meat Loaf's Bat Out Of Hell remained on the charts for about nine years and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including a surgical surgery for her heart arrhythmia in 2003, after a collapse during a concert.
In 2007, an acute laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
He later discovered that he had a cyst in his vocal cord.
Dark city street, often forgotten and ready for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other roads, some famous, others simply of service.
However, many people, including veteran taxi drivers and longtime local residents, find it difficult to indicate the location of the Extra Place, especially because many of them have never heard of this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and stretches north of First Street – before I found Second Street – between the Bowery and Second Avenue.
This pathway, about 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, resembles a dusty streetway over an active pathway.
There are no signs.
It is almost impossible to find in an atlas.
The street has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company that has recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
He wants to repaviment Extra Place and create a clean corridor to the stores and boutiques that are expected to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include old-fashioned neighbors who commented on being delighted with the truncated track simply because it is one of the last remains of the block’s past before the appropriation of the buildings.
However, the Department of Housing, Preservation and Development of the city, which has control of the street, has no interest in owning it.
At the meeting of the Vencidad Community Committee for Land Use that took place this month, representatives of the Avalon agency sketched a proposal to buy the street.
However, the committee, preferring the street to remain to the city, called for a new plan to be presented next month, as Susan Stetzer, District Manager of Community No. 3 said.
“The city owns very few spaces today and we would like it to continue to own Extra Place,” Ms. said.
“We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage the space, but we also want to ensure public access to the street.”
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that it wanted to repair the small street and install some seats, including some to be used as coffee, waiting to rent the spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street first emerged during this month’s meeting
But Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the street, it didn’t necessarily want to own it.
“Avalon Bay’s primary concern is the renovation of this abandoned street and the possibility of turning it into a public area,” he said, adding that the sale proposal came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Preservation Committee, confirmed that it was a city’s desire to sell the street and noted that the agency’s mission is to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful surroundings, those of the Bowery, Extra Place has left a mark on history.
Some believe it got its name in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's large estate was divided between his sons and this narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opens in Extra Place, but the street is best known for the photograph of the establishment that comes out on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
"The surroundings were magnificent," commented Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
“It was full of garbage, pieces of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes.”
Some residents, including bloggers writing about East Village’s urbanization, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public goods, however modest they may be, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare, virtually unchanged piece, a raja of the city that should be protected.
Jeremías Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitle, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has made available part of a city history talk about Extra Place, published by the newspaper The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: “Extra Place is a slightly narrow and outgoing street, dark as well by day and marked by oxidized iron warehouse doors and counter-windows, with weekly old newspapers blown along the canals.”
With few exceptions, the street looked more or less the same in a recent afternoon.
A rat was healed through the back of the street and stopped near the door used to enter the CBGB and which now houses a luxury clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls and an empty 22-oz beer bottle were near a new batch of discarded newspapers.
Some passers said they rarely paid attention to Extra Place, but suggested they could give it a cleanup.
Mr Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimate the attractive power of the street in its current state.
“I spent the best years of my life,” he said, “in dark, wet, and ugly places.”
Bilingualism: Immersion in the English Language
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss candidate positions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a senior associate in California studies and director of studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book “Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice.”
Effectively calling Hispanic voters is a tough business.
The education proposals made by Barack Obama are an example of that.
Mr. Obama’s campaign notes that “Afro-Americans and Latin students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” and this is a very certain consideration.
To combat such differences in learning events, Obama’s education plan specifically advocates, among other things, “transitional bilingual education” for students-English.
However, the question open to Mr. Obama is whether the commitment to bilingual education, which prefers classroom instruction in languages other than English, is effective in overcoming the distance in final results.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized primary school in the eastern Los Angeles County region.
In this school the vast majority of students are Hispanic and low-income families:
More than one-third of students, many of whom are newcomers, are learning the English language.
However, an incredible 100 percent of fourth-year students have been evaluated positively on the 2008 math exam.
And almost an equally stunning 93 percent has mastered the English Language and Arts test.
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient than that favoured by Mr. Obama.
The Sixth Street School emphasizes review and practice, the constant evaluation of competences and does not tolerate any attitude of excuses.
Moreover, and here’s where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the Sixth Street principal, the school’s approach to teaching English to students is on “total immersion.”
Immersion in English means the almost exclusive use of the language in the treatment of the content of the instruction.
Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, “We’ve had extraordinary successes with students like this last one who has come from Mexico and that if you enter the classroom 12 months later you’t be able to pick up what it was.”
“It works,” he said, “we believe it works.”
Will Mr. Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model to replicate for other schools with large population of Hispanic-English students?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the answer, but the idea of the politicians of their party on the issue of education (the National Education Associations have long been advocates of bilingual education) and their own constant support for bilingual education obscures Mr. Obama’s prediction of the response.
While it’s true that immigrants should learn English, recently Mr. Obama has trivialized the issue leaving people to stop worrying about legislation that is only written in English.
And instead, he said, “You have to make sure your child can speak Spanish.”
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close gaps, he should carefully consider educational models that work well, rather than despise or trivialize them.
Oil prices fall sharply after renewed economic fears
Oil prices dropped drastically on Monday due to concerns that the U.S. bailout plan for financial markets may not be able to revitalize the economy.
Oil stocks dropped by 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel on the morning trading at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has dropped by more than $20 a barrel since Monday.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial crisis on Wall Street and a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a peak of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices had dropped to almost $90 per barrel earlier this month, before falling back again due to huge uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety seized investors once again on Monday, despite congressional leaders saying they had reached an agreement during the weekend on the bailout plan, the largest in history.
The news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far from over.
The evolution that occurred in the latest episode of the merger process confirms that Citigroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, the government said on Monday.
Meanwhile, the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said that, over the hectic weekend, the negotiations that led to the bailout deal “seemingly failed to reactivate the market sentiment.”
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to drop.
"The outlook for global equity, interest rate and exchange rate will be increasingly uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
“We believe that basic products will not be able to escape this contagion.
From the product perspective, our most pressing concern is evaluating whether the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China.”
Bank analysts have lowered their expectations for next year, as oil consumption drops due to the crisis in economic growth and the forecast of oil and gas price reduction is 20 percent for 2009.
Second quarter of madness: team sets record
After spending, over the past eight seasons, more time than anyone else in the Jets uniform, playing in defense, Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all.
Then he saw how things unfolded in the second quarter this Sunday, when the Jets turned an unnoticed match into a game of deflation.
“I’ve never seen anything like that,” said Ellis.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had played lazily under the shadows of the clouds.
At this time it happened that quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles performing a 12-yard goal and suggesting the perfect premise for an afternoon, in which the evolution of relationship between the players had a great leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more goals in the quarter, one of these when a cornerback fell and another came with 10 seconds in the half.
"I didn't get out of my way," said Favre of every step that went to Coles.
“He’s a devil of a player.
Our communication has been great, regardless of what people might think.”
While Favre and Coles were playing in the dam, the Cardinals defended quarterback Kurt Warner.
The cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a walking shot and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith pointed to another pass and intercepted him.
Linebacker David Bowens was forced to miss by Warner.
In the last turnover, the faults forced by Bowens could have been the best.
The Cardenals had taken possession with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely gave him a 20-yard kick to win a final 34-0.
These are the highest points the Jets have never scored in a quarter.
To Team Coach Eric Mangini, asking him to describe the madness of this moment, he said, “The second quarter or the third quarter?”
When both were answered - the Jets allowed 21 points unanswered in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can say I liked the second quarter much more than the third.
They’ve won a lot of points in a very short period of time.”
Gebrselassie Leads His World Record
Once again, Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has demonstrated why many consider him the greatest runner in history, breaking his own world record at the Berlin Marathon this Sunday and becoming the first person able to run the 26.2 mile race in 2 hours 4 minutes.
Following the victory in the accommodating flat race at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie has crushed for 27 seconds its previous record of 2:04:26, obtained last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has set the 26th world record in an impressive length race so he has set a world championship or a world record for any distance, from the counter-clock race to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie did not take part in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing — too alarming, in retrospect — that air pollution would aggravate his asthma problems.
Instead, he set out to run in Berlin.
In virtually perfect conditions – sunny and with 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end – Gebrselassie won this Sunday, employing in the middle of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have become long-distance runners, the marathon record has been reduced by more than two minutes in the last decade, as Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After last Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that he had suffered cramps in the pantorrilla two weeks earlier and that he had missed a week of training.
It is obvious that the suspension left it fresh, not oxidized.
“I’m very happy,” Gebrselassie told reporters.
“Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I had some doubts, but in the end everything went well.”
The athlete has been subject to some criticism – especially in Kenya, the African-Oriental rival of Ethiopia – for the style of orchestrating too much of his races, in general, avoiding the encounter with many world marathon stars, based on scoring as if it were a race track, and putting records ahead of the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie’s skills as a runner.
On Sunday, on the march of four Kenyans, Gebrselassie reached the half of the race at 1:02:04.
Two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began challenging Gebrselassie after their scoring dropped.
But shortly before three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie took a last boost to separate from Kwambai, who finished second at 2:05:36, improving his best personal record by five minutes.
Kamathi reached third place at 2:07:48.
In the female race, Irina Mikitenko, native of Kazakhstan but now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning at 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe of Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36, was a surprise and won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She also did not take part in the Beijing Games so was described as a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin and set her personal best record in almost five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
He did a clever computing race, leaving a quartet of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners to head off and then recovering them after 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia won second place in 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a city apart, the pride and the trials of color life
Hidden by the expansion of the great Orlando theme park, a few kilometers from the bright, noisy and colossal city, there is a quiet village, where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are very obvious.
Eatonville, the first completely black-inhabited city incorporated into the country and place of Zora Neale Hurston's childhood, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 men of color, 300 good swimmers, many guayabas, two schools and not even a prison."
It is now a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Fair in Eatonville to pay tribute to Mrs. Hurston, the most famous Harlem Renaissance writer.
And yet, in many ways, the city she described – making it also a tourist stage by its inclusion in the Florida Travel Guide produced by the Federal Writers Project of the Depression Season – remains a place apart.
The city remains independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Mrs. Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their true ideas with the white man, who “knows so little about us and doesn’t know what’s being lost.”
Even now, in the year that a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has drawn attention to starting a dialogue on the race issue, many are still cautious in the face of the stranger.
“We’re very cautious about the way our story is told,” said Jones Hortense, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the city’s oldest church.
“It has to be right.”
Eatonville has always been defined a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is at the same time a historic model of the affirmation of blacks and a community of almost 2,400 people living under a level of poverty double the national average.
It is a literary center, but also a repaired example of the rural culture of the black south – sometimes despised, others praised – that was born of slavery in America.
It is not surprising, if those who live here are both proud and reserved.
And the concern for Eatonville’s image actually started with Zora, as here no one calls her Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through her profound dialect books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed the city, barely out of Route 17, a road that runs through the center of Florida often forgotten into black history and human drama.
Having a cement face in both life and literature, Mrs. Hurston took her readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then inside more private areas.
"Out of the road to the left," he wrote, "there is the modern brown public school with its white finishes, its well-maintained gardens and playgrounds, cared for by Howard Miller, as he can barely read and write."
She also mentions Widow Dash's new husband and writes that Glenn Lee "sells drinks of all kinds and anything goes away with transitional rooms."
Thus, in just a few hundred words, Mrs. Hurston puts Eatonville in relation to the autonomous government, but also to illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Obviously, this Fodor did not.
Not everyone liked the portrait.
"Zora described it as it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of the Johnson girls Mrs. Hurston immortalized by quoting men who were singing colorless songs about their beauty.
He added, “Some people didn’t like that.”
Ms. Hurston is still remembered here as a vivid eccentric who often returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77, recalls that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in town, she did so without notice in a large Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still today is proud to wear with dignity.
Most residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many laughed sarcastically.
“People were always very happy to see Zora,” follows Mr. Franklin.
But, she adds, balancing on her chair in a backyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Mrs. Hurston was probably baptized, “she never stayed too long.”
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were no longer in print.
Like most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten about her.
Although she was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only women of color at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous tomb in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had been living.
In Eatonville, there were no large commemorative ceremonies, nor large public readings.
"I don't think her contribution to the world or her legacy was understood," said Valerie Boyd, author of Wrapped in Rainbows, a biography of Mrs. Hurston published in 2003.
A certain turn came in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to put a five-way road across the city to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-way street of the labor community.
The expansion of the Orlando area had already pushed the Interstate 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period of its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to his relatively idyllic isolation from the community.
In the 1950s, the struggle for racial mixing brought hatred around the community.
“During that season, a group of white boys went around the city throwing oranges and everything against the people who were sitting next to them,” said Mr. Franklin.
They killed a girl, too.
He was thrown into a car sandwich.”
In a 1955 letter to Mrs. Hurston he wrote to the newspaper The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the forced integration by the Supreme Court that, in Brown v. Board of Education "insulted instead of honouring my race."
Residents say today that the school segregation, positive in some respects, had weakened Eatonville’s cohesion and undermined the confidence of its young people.
“Black kids were used to being hugged – I remember this – they used to hug the teacher in the morning and at night,” said N.Y. Nathiri, the daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit organization.
This lasted, he added, until the professors and students did not come from the same place.
“I wasn’t hugging your teacher because he was white – there’s a cultural gap there,” Ms. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped create space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors and artists who went above prejudice, just as she did, with boyant, confident and lines like: “How can anyone deny himself the pleasure of my company!
I do not understand.”
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Mrs. Hurston's anonymous tomb and began to fight to revive her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Mrs. Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in bookstores, reintroducing it into American canons.
The road project came right at the time when Eatonville’s most famous daughter was again under the reflectors.
And this time, Mrs. Hurston’s old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning a fair for Mrs. Hurston to show what the county could ruin with that road.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its road proposal.
"The resurrected idea of the five-way road, would have been to put in what you would call curvature speed, a real civic pride," Ms. Nathiri said.
Ms. Boyd said it more simply: “Zora saved Eatonville.”
The victory over the road project has helped change the image of the city itself.
People from outside town like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began coming to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to review the past.
Eatonville entered the National Historical Register in 1998.
A new library (bearing the name of Hurston, of course) opened its doors in 2006, on a repavimented and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: just six miles from downtown Orlando, you can sometimes feel like in a street of the past under a summer rain, in a city as small as the one that was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90% of people are black today.)
Strangers who come in search of Eatonville’s history, its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A Early permission is required to do most of the interviews, and some things — such as walls in Eatonville’s oldest church, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the field — cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a brave and convinced teacher who has weakness for bright red, still fear that her island community may be misinterpreted.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has expanded, a higher level of natal pride has also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville in the same way that Mrs. Hurston saw her entire race: beauty, and all problems, not better, not worse, and equally to the other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, working, stupid and mixed.
It’s a sincere civic sense that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin’s nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who is planning to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or for the Police Department, who he said might need some help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
“Most people, in case they dare to go here, will have to think, ‘Oh, this city is nothing compared to any other’,” says Alondra Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday.
“But if you really stop and take a moment to look at its history, it’s a very nice city.”
In New York, everybody is talking about money.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the kiosks and the gigantic TV screens on Times Square, they’t realize they’d be in the hurricane’s eye.
They could never imagine that behind the glass facade of the bee nested offices that lie above their heads, the bankers and speculative fund managers who monopolize New York face daily the worst “bad office day” since the 1929 downturn.
Boys for home delivery continue to make their metal tea carts resonate through the sidewalks and bringing muffins plates for breakfast meetings.
Latino men continue to drag between rough apartment buildings, just like human mules, with 50 eccentric stamped shirts hanging to a yoke through their shoulders. Office workers still wait in line for their breakfast to bring, and it remains impossible to pick up a taxi between 4 and 7 p.m. on working days.
Employees are still waiting to catch their bagel to the sales carts, and yet it’s impossible to find a taxi between four and five in the afternoon on weekdays.
It seemed to me as if there was no crisis at all, until, this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts there, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had calculated the time it took for the operation to coincide with the late afternoon calm at my local J.P. Morgan Chase branch, a queue of about 20 people was already waiting.
And not in front of the employee’s window, to withdraw their cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer service bank, where lifelong customers order their checks, tourists look for instructions to go to Macy’s large stores and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people preceded me, I was later informed by Starr, my “trusted personal banker,” and they were in line for the same reason as me.
Unlike me, still, they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks in places from where they had switched them, places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had taken their money from the so-called savings associations (a bit like a construction company), from the credit unions and savings boxes of their hometown whose branches only function within the state of belonging, and which they say treat customers as their family.
Over the past year, 15 of these banks have quietly failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went bankrupt, and as New Yorkers headed to their homes Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with about $440 billion in savings deposits, was looking for a bailout buyer.
The office and store workers who stood in front of me, fearing another collapse, were transferring their money to a bank to what is considered a safe haven, which is what most Wall Street rescuers are doing.
Ordinary people in New York City have become experts in finance in recent weeks.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket, speaking by phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and its upset executive director, Dick Fuld, commented on the matter familiarly as if they complained about a colleague’s inactivity.
And Lyn, the fifty-year-old and somewhat uniformed conserge of my apartment block, has changed the normal course of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my shopping at the shop.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that “I now have all my savings in money market funds.
The switch is done, I’m not taking any risks.”
Muslim tombs profaned as Austria approaches the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, of the left wing of the far-right party for Austria’s freedom, and Filip Dewinter from Belgium, affiliated with the far-right party Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization “Cities Against Islamization” in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry traffic signs representing mosques with a red line crossing.
Police are blaming far-right extremists for profaning a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend that far-right political parties made huge gains in the country’s general elections.
More than 90 tombs were severely damaged at Traun Cemetery, near Linz, at some point between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was an organized action.
Criminals sprayed Jewish symbols, such as the David Star, on some of the tombs, but investigators think this may have happened in an attempt to hide the real motives of the extremists driven by hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident was in any way related to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the profanation, which reached Muslim religious when the month of Ramadan was coming to an end.
Meanwhile, Austria is preparing for an introspection round after the turn to the right in yesterday’s parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that seized 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, had conducted a campaign embedded in anti-immigration vehemence and some of their slogans were considered xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, made his campaign against headphones and burkas, and also expressed his opposition to foods considered to be related to Islam.
In his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a “European brotherhood” to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both parties attempt to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they were symbols of the ongoing Islamization policy in Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses conducted immediately after the elections, which have confirmed the far right as the country’s strongest political block, indicate that the change occurred mainly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Travel ban abroad for Gary Glitter
The courts have banned Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, from traveling to France and Spain.
Magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed surveillance authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
Kent police formulated a ban on traveling abroad last Thursday after magistrates had produced evidence of Glitter's previous convictions for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford Magistrates Court in Kent, but was represented by lawyer Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: “On Thursday, September 25, at the Ashford Magistrates Court in Kent, police requested an order to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from travelling abroad as well as to France and Spain until March 25.
“Paul Gadd did not attend in person.”
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad, on the grounds of being on the sex offender register.
He must notify the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days
You must also inform the police of the scheduled departure date with seven days in advance.
Kent police said they would not discuss the individual case or Glitter's possible place of residence in the county.
A Kent Police spokesman said: “Kent police will do everything they can to protect children in this country, or abroad.
A Kent Police spokesman said: “Kent police will do everything they can to protect children in this country, or abroad.
“From our point of view, it is easier to monitor someone who stays in the UK because here we have the systems to manage all possible risks more effectively.
“Protecting the inhabitants of Kent is the main concern of Kent police and we work closely together to monitor the behavior of registered sex offenders in the county and minimize any risk that may exist for the public.”
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls, aged between 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
However, he said he felt ill and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport controls and eventually flew to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted he would return to Britain.
He probably arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on August 22 and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Magistrates' Court, west of London, after Scotland Yard had successfully applied the order to register as a sexual offender.
Glitter had been jailed in the UK for four months in 1999 for possession of images of child abuse.
A source from the Ministry of Internal Affairs that Jacqui Smith, the Interior Minister, reassured and rejoiced to hear that they had banned Glitter from traveling to France and Spain.
"I capture the master out of the scene to extract his character" - Günther Bauer
No heels, no volants, no opening costumes.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, deprived of the concentration in interpretation to obtain the relaxed look of the man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
The other person.
They are inseparable except in privacy, in those moments outside the public, when they find the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of a hand, careless because they will not come out on stage.
The German Günther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" the theatricality of some stages with singers, dancers and guitarists with that less known side of these masters.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular iconography of flamenco from different areas.
Included in the programming of the Month of Flamenco Photography, the exhibition “reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day,” explains the creator, who clarifies that “Flamenco-people” “can be any people but, by seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists on the stage.
These people portrayed “on the street” are artists able to transmit on stage passion, sadness, joy... captivating the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists there is no need to take pictures of the stage.
They carry their personality and character inside.
What I was interested in was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the big flamenco with the camera.”
With the taste of the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer began in 1977 a long journey to portray singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
They are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and the material, resemble classical photography.
The application of different stylistic media breaks with the classic basis of the image, giving it modernity, an idea that reflects how Bauer himself understands flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, which evolves and surprises every day."
It is not the action of dance, singing or touching itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, which captivates the public with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essential, with the duende that is visible in a way of feeling, being and being are and have been the constant of this work that is presented these days in the gallery El Fotómata.
Famous figures of flamenco such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, configure this selection of almost seventy photographed artists.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exposed in the sample.
Bauer’s passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with “Portraits of veteran athletes” (“SportARTproject”).
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "I love portraying people, knowing them and being able to enter a moment in their life, whether a long or short moment.
I think that within photography the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or face people, characters, that sometimes you do not even know, or that leave you only a few minutes to be able to take the photo.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true.”
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco that is titled "Flamenco-people" is exhibited in the El Fotómata Gallery, located at number 20 of the street of the Mata, parallel to the Alameda de Hércules, where it can be visited until the next 16th of October.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "a temerity"
It is set in places it does not yet know and verses on unknown matters, but yet, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to advance the new project in which he works, a novel that has as the protagonist Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and passed through the Amazon.
The ever-favourite Nobel Prize winner confessed yesterday in his passage to the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that today occupies him "is a temerity" and that "everything indicates that he should not write" the novel.
"If I were sensible, I't do it, but I'm going to do it and I hope to finish it someday," he concluded in his intervention at the festival of exchange of ideas, thought and words that for four days has seen a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people pass through the city of the Aqueducte.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the prominent figures of the third edition of the party of the word and met the forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the Hay Festival award for being the most voted writer by the participants - an ancient edition of "Our mutual friend", by Dickens-, filled the space of the theater Juan Bravo.
Presented by Félix Romeo, he found before himself a public delivered to which the hour was very short in which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with large doses of humor, looked at how his literary vocation was born in him, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "pleasure of reading" and "living more than what he lived"; how he wrote "disciplined" to supplement his "failure of inspiration" with an intense work of documentation, correcting and reworking a lot; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alejandro Dumasyer influenced his vocation and what "images of memory" are the basis on which their stories are based.
The Spanish-American novelist recognized that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," Vargas Llosa, who said that this "has effects" and "does the people more inconforme", so he asked the writers "not to abandon the frivolity" and "assume responsibility" their vocation.
The climatology diminishes the fair of Pozoblanco that also remains without racks
The feast of rejones that closed the fee for the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after checking the rejoicers announced that the floor of the square was not in the best conditions.
The company, in accordance with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
The weather conditions have slowed with this fair, as finally two of its three celebrations have not been able to celebrate.
Saturday was the rain that prevented the celebration of the planned second bull race.
The poster was composed by José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who were going to face a closure of Castilblanco.
There was a celebration on Friday.
In it, the triumphant was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and came out to his shoulders, after leaving passages with taste and aesthetics.
That same afternoon Alejandro Talavante sold his two stakes with greetings and an ear, which granted more of the stretches than his toreo.
That is, worse still was El Juli, which passed through the coso of Los Llanos without penalty or glory.
In his second bull, after a faena of relief, he won the bronze of a large part of the public.
In Alabama, a truck with two thousand kilos of hashish was checked.
Five less ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Ertzaintza in the municipality of Armiñón (Álava).
Police arrest the two occupants of a truck and they begin to flee.
His load, more than two tons of hashish, was not like to stop.
The officers pursued them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man, identified as A. A. J., according to a statement from the Basque Government's Interior Department.
The suspect has been charged with drug trafficking and falsification of public documents.
The incident was recorded when several officials of the Traffic Unit of Álava carried out a transport control on the N-1, at its passage through the municipality of Armiñón.
They were ready to stop a van for inspection when the driver disobeyed the orders, accelerated abruptly and the control was skipped.
The officers started their pursuit until the vehicle stopped a couple of kilometers later in the arcade, when their two occupants fled to flee the race through a forested area.
The ertzaines finally reached one of them and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they carried and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hashish beams, so they were transferred to police offices for a thorough inspection and weighing of the drug.
In addition, the officials verified that the registration had been "dobbled" since it did not coincide with the collection in the documentation of the furgon, so the arrested was also charged with a crime of falsification of a public document.
The Ertzaintza continues the investigation to proceed to the arrest of the other suspect, who managed to escape to the race as said, and to determine the origin of the drug seized.
The detainee, A. A. J. 28 years old, was transferred to police offices to carry out the corresponding diligences and will be made available to the court in the coming hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, has been arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the effects of some medication.
A witness saw her perform strange manoeuvres while trying to get out of her parking lot in Montecito, a spokesman for the California road patrol told People magazine.
The witness has detailed that around 16.30 hours, Locklear "was walking down the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the parking lot forward and back, and as he went backwards he passed several times above his sunglasses".
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who apparently did not recognize the actress at first, saw that Locklear stopped on a nearby highway and got out of the vehicle.
This person was the one who alerted the emergency services because “she was concerned about Locklear’s life.”
When the police patrols arrived, they found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"It seemed disoriented," so the agents took her to a specialized drug and alcohol center to do a test.
According to a police spokeswoman, the actress was cooperative and excess alcohol was discarded from the first moment, although "according to officials at first glance, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some medicine."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the effects of a substance that has not been specified and entered the local prison around 19:00 a.m. although she was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left a treatment clinic in Arizona where he was recovering from an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian federation of IU to assume its competences in the Silva case
The general coordinator of IU and deputy of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it will be the regional federation of the formation that will have to take a decision on the case of the former mayor of Youth and Sports of the City of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after he was accused of treating families.
"I for these things am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its competences," Llamazares said about the action that the party must adopt with what he has so far been a council member in the Seville consistory.
However, the leader of IU defended that the need for "transparency" is present in the possible investigations on irregularities that Silva could have committed: "IU has always defended that this type of matters have the maximum degree of transparency."
In the same line he stressed that the training has "strict ethical codes for all public officers".
'Blood of May', Garci's epic bet
Inspired by the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous Spanish uprising against the French in Blood of May, which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with close to 15 million euros in budget.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried to "illustrate the torrent of characters and social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of an extensive cast of interpreters.
Blood of May, with a meterage of more than two and a half hours, premieres this Friday in the cinemas, to become in the future a miniseries for Telemadrid of more than four hours of duration.
Great admirer of the literature of Galdós, José Luis Garci assures that he has fulfilled this filming "a childhood dream", which must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid commissioned him three years ago to film a commemorative tape for the second centenary of May 2 Madrid, something he accepted as long as the story was based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million budget that has been provided in its entirety by the Madrid Community constitutes for Garci a “unique opportunity” to ambient with the decorations and the suitable garment the portrait of “an overwhelmed Spain that was wrong as a leader to fight for, since the struggle for independence led the people to enormous delay with the reign of Fernando VII”, he said.
But the filmmaker regrets not having a funding like that of Alatriste or Goya’s ghosts – more than twice that of Blood of May – so he has not been able to shoot some scenes shaped in a script signed with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has collaborated in almost his entire career.
Therefore, the director of “Back to Start” has incided on what is his usual form of work, the set-up with the actors, with whom he usually tries before starting the shooting and those who do not cast, for appearing “humiliating” and considering that “part of the director’s profession resides in going to the theater and cinema to know what happens in the industry in which he works”.
Many of the interpreters with whom he coincides in Blood of May repeat before his camera, as is the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Candidate for the Oscar in four occasions – of which he won one – Garci considers that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the Blood of May, Seven French Billboards and the finally selected, The Blind Sunshine, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, “which is the one that must be made known,” he said.
With this film Garci does not expect any prizes.
“In the beginning you think you work for posterity, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and now you conform to making one more film,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabel Bayón recovers the essence of Seville dancer Tórtola Valencia
A Sevillan dancer will pay tribute to a Sevillan dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, of Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana neighborhood and moved to London with her family when she was three years old.
She was a free dancer and a specialist in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, pioneering the liberation of women, like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked a dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe between wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me and it seemed incredible.”
According to the dancer, "we do not intend to tell his life but to collect his spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested me flamenco sticks.
So, “the butterfly dance” suggested me a guajira, or “the serpent dance” some tangos.
His dance was sensual and I have been told that my dance is also within this aesthetic,” he says.
The assembly has two exceptional collaborations: Miguel Poveda who will sing Isabel again in one of his shows, as he did in "La puerta abierta"; and with the teacher Matilde Coral, who has exceptionally wanted to collaborate with whoever was his student.
“Matilde makes of Tórtola de mayor, the character of maturity.
I’m happy because I have accepted to act in my work and I feel very honored for that.”
The set also features musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, the cante of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this type of artists who were dives in all their extent, and who are always in love with them."
In the work is also told somehow the life of this woman that developed in places so far away, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, as well as throughout Europe, as she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remember her because I think it is of those women who have an enormous influence in a certain time and now nobody knows and much less puts in value her work," says Bayón.
The show will begin today at 20.30 at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The publication of the "Diary of a Newly Married Poet" also closes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez contracted marriage with Zenobia in March 1916, falls within the activities programmed by the Council of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía to celebrate the "Trienio Zenobia y Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized in order to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the death of both.
In this way, the "Trienio Zenobia y Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress that has been held in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum House and with the itinerant exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: That shake of light", which was inaugurated last May and that, after travelling through the different Andalusian provinces, is expected to travel to New York during the course of the International Congress.
Also, the Council of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America Less Liked by Paul Newman
“Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
The phrase is from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Absence of Malice", and gives the idea of the disappointment of American cinema, and of all America, in the shocking idea that Newman has gone.
It cost him an Oscar.
He has been withdrawn since 2007.
He knew he was very sick.
Still, it has been a mess for everyone.
“Sometimes what one feels is beyond any expression, and I have now lost a great friend,” cried Robert Redford, “my life and my country have been better thanks to their existence.”
No one was afraid to ridicule or exaggerate.
A father of cinema and homeland had died at a dark time, afraid of terrorists and markets, with American self-esteem on the ground, desperately looking for reasons for dignity.
When time is so hard and there is no virtue for men and very few beings to admire, it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
It embodied for everyone a almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was Richard Nixon's formal enemy and a defender of lost and won causes, from the drug-fighting foundation created in honor of his firstborn who died from overdose to his home and organic food brand.
A whole gift to a country that has cost a lot to overcome a suicidal food culture.
The expansive wave of admiration barred Hollywood without taking into account nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, observed that not a man has died, but an era.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was nothing more than the peak of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
“It has left us very high,” George Clooney, one of the few who today dare to try to live as Paul Newman lived: keeping high the demand for probity and having a serious private life and away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today’s media jungle.
But there are those who try, and Paul Newman is his example.
He divorced once but was then married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful when he surely had the chances of not being.
“But why am I going to eat hamburgers outside of the house, if I have filets inside?” he used to joke himself.
In heaven he is proud that on earth his daughters coincide with his fans, something not so common in America.
“Of all the great roles he played, none was so proud as that of a devout husband, a loving father, a caring grandfather and a dedicated philanthropist,” they say.
The Imperfect Race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that the Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday’s race, I say no!
They called it the perfect race, and in my opinion it has been the worst race I’ve ever been in.
A bunch of nonsense that, of course, if they considered it as an assessment and I examined it, it would be a very clear suspension.
But let’s go by parts and from the beginning.
The scams start with the collection of the dorsal, which makes you have to go earlier.
That doesn’t seem bad to me, but if they already make you go they give it all (including the chip to avoid queues in the race).
No is no.
Here they just made you go to pick up the dorsal (first nonsense, go just for that) and (after the relevant tail), surprise!, there was only size 'S' for the shirt (second nonsense, because I need a size XL)
In what world do we live?
Or is it because of the crisis that they have decided to buy only small shirts with fewer fabrics and cheaper?
Well, things like these are a little compared to those of the day of the race.
Apart from having to go very early to pick up the chip, the tail on arrival is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
More than 35 minutes of waiting lasted, something incomprehensible for a race where more than 11,000 people are expected.
Then, as expected, the race began and we had not yet left the backpack, although once achieved, the pickup was worse.
In addition, the rain mitigated the wait of more than 40 minutes, which joined with conats of popular rebellion and assault on the house.
I think about 500 people will probably have pneumonia tomorrow, and some like me, will not even appear with the right time in the ranking, due to the chip they gave me that, I imagine, didn’t mark me out correctly.
Of course, if I were asked about the perfect race, it’t get into my mind.
So I think we will continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a receiver (virtual)
At the MIT Emerging Technologies conference, Microsoft showed an advance of a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of Artificial Intelligence without much intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as asking for a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a launcher to move through the company's campus) taking into account what you hear in the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a shape and face recognition system, this “receptionist” can know how many people there are in the room, who they are – even remember what they wear – and listen and understand the keywords of their conversations.
Also group the present according to the conversation groups.
In the sample video, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that she does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not an employee of the company.
He asks if he’s there to visit someone and says he’ll look after him soon.
All without a blue screen.
It is impressive.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
There has been a lot of talk this week about a change in strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if computers came with the essential things instead of loaded with commercial garbage, they would go five times faster – man, Steve, it will be for less.
All a finding considering that Microsoft, version after version, has added features and “extras” to Windows.
The change of course is appreciated.
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing importance, and also the software.
When Google Chrome came out to the network, I was one of those who joined the theory that it was Google’s first step to compete with Windows.
Many have correctly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential layer for hardware and software to be understood.
You perform the same function as your wife or husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
It is true.
It will never disappear but we must think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but relative.
What Ballmer has said this week is confirmation of this idea.
People are increasingly paying less attention to the operating system, and more to the web browser.
The computer starts only to run Firefox or Explorer – or Chrome – and every day we spend more time browsing than in the window environment.
Why are half of the applications in the system used?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services and finally being an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I bring a small example.
I took the photo of this post in one of Microsoft’s employees’ restrooms in Redmond earlier this month.
On the refresh machine a poster asks them to use their search tool - "Your search.Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the web.
Last week, by the way, a delay was also confirmed in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not come in early 2009 but at the end, rather pulling in 2010.
Microsoft will seek the joint release of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
After all, the phone is becoming more computer every day.
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already on the street, will pass bill.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso carried it on the Blue Coast, Leonardo di Caprio looked one in Edward Zwick's "Diamond of Blood", the same as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's "El Padrino" and is part of the uniform of the muscular gay parish.
And if we start to enumerate star appearances, we can go back to the image of that sharp bigote forced who lifted weights in a walking circus.
Essentially, it’s nothing more than the typical men’s cotton interior t-shirt, cemented and without sleeves.
The ‘tank’, which the English speakers call it, but the Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles stands above all the others.
First, for its rimbombing name - although it is familiarly known as 'Marcel' - it has to do with the sport because it receives its name, according to the legend, from boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of singer Edith Piaf.
‘La Marcel’ stands out above all others for its excellent cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive shield and for the small Belgian flag (only recognizable) that the most emblematic shirts wear as a detail on the neck.
And be careful, because the production of the Belgian firm is not just focused on its tank tops.
It also includes college sweaters, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, marine shirts, babies, mini shorts...
It is designed for the comfort of underwear.
It is a pity to leave them as clothes.
They have too much charm.
"I want to be a young mom; the candidate doesn't bother me"
His enormous resemblance to his sister has not prevented him from developing his own personality.
Mónica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently, Cruz sisters are taking their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Mónica, they are much more than just beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
He has been in Paris for the promotion that the firm Mango makes at its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Warm and shy, wins on short distances.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penélope and I have conceived for Mango in this new autumn-winter season, as well as attending the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner of the Opera in honor of Valentino.
A very intense day but at the same time exciting.
What is your new collection for Mango based on this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I love the movies of the 50s and 60s; from there we have a lot of references.
Then, I like to get lost in a city and watch women dress, combine and mix their clothes, I do a lot.
Dancer, actress and designer, you’re a very polyphasic woman, aren’t you?
I think yes, but in the end, they all come together and have a lot in common.
I liked clothes from a young age; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s house to hide in my aunt’s closet and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to take care of how I dressed.
You already know that dancers like to make our styles for classes and rehearsals, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress when you get the dressing room is when you really find the character.
Then, everything goes together, that is, with a lot of respect for designers and professionalism.
Have you reached the age of 30, have you come into a crisis?
What is.
I feel better than ever, I like my 30s.
I find that the woman is made, has experience and tastes life with fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn’t scare me.
I’ve done the things I wanted since childhood and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
Do you want to be a mother or not?
Of course, I know that I’m going to be a mother because my body asks for it, and I also want to be a young mom; I don’t want to lose that.
As for the candidate, I’m not worried.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As for the movie, you’re waiting for several premieres that you shot last year.
It is so, and I want you to see the light.
I, who am a woman who comes from the theater, am very impatient and restless, I want everything for now and of course, it can’t be.
I’m looking forward to ‘The Last Hour’ and ‘In Search of the Tomb of Christ’.
See what they look like...
A few days ago you debuted on a pass with Naomi Campbell, didn’t you?
Well, well, do not say that.
It’s not that I’m going to go on a walk to be a model.
She simply called me Naomi Campbell, whom I’ve known for a long time, to invite me to go to London to participate in a charity parade for her organization ‘Women for a Better World’ and the clothes we exhibited – I pulled out two pieces of our collection for Mango – were auctioned to raise money for this Naomi’s NGO.
People don’t know that tender heart of Naomi.
There are so many things said about her that I, who know her, would tell you that many are not true.
In addition, I stay with that so good part in which she is involved.
He asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if he comes to ask me to make the pine, then too.
To benefit women of the Third World, whatever it takes.
Drivers who are suffering from alcohol must install the ‘alcolock’
Interior wants the driver with three administrative sanctions for alcoholemia, have to install in their vehicle a system that prevents starting the drunk vehicle, or if it does not blow.
The initiative was announced last June and now appears included in the annual memory of the Prosecutor General of the State, according to which it is a pilot project that will have a duration of one year.
Its purpose is the reinsertion of the driver, so he will also receive a road reeducation course.
In the experience, in addition to the General Prosecutor’s Office for Road Safety, the General Directorate of Traffic (DGT) and the Institute of Technology for Automobile Safety Foundation (FITSA) will participate.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of drivers who have been more than once for driving drunk take the car again.
The Alcolock would avoid it since it is a vehicle-connected system that measures the rate of alcohol in breathed air and prevents starting the car if the driver does not blow abtes; or when a concentration of alcohol is detected is higher than permitted.
Its cost is more than 1,000 euros and would run on account of the sanctioned.
In this sense, a study conducted in the U.S. in 2007 demonstrated that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce offenses by up to 65% during the first year of implementation.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people each year.
The measure cines to administrative sanctions for two reasons: addressing those behaviors before they result in criminal offences.
And facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done by ordinary means, and yet the necessary reform by criminal means requires a reform in an organic law.
The device is still not available in the Spanish market in any commercial mode, although it has already been experimentally implanted in some industrial and public service vehicles.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote tomorrow on a PSOE initiative in which it is proposed to install this system in school buses, as has been done in France.
In Mexico and without ‘peep-toes’
With British punctuality, at 17.40, the time planned in the program, landed in the Presidential Hangar of the Benito Juárez airport of Mexico DF the aircraft of the Spanish air force in which the Príncipes of Asturias traveled.
The sun was in retreat but his rays still forced him to use his hand as a visor to see the real couple descend from the plane.
At the foot of the staircase, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
Hours earlier, he had asked the taxi driver in the street if he knew the Spanish princes were visiting the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very good, then you won't be able to go to the airport to charge at that time...She's from here or so...
“No, no sir, she’s Spanish but she’s lived here a couple of years.
Oh, very good...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the princes of Asturias are and the importance of the trip.
Many are waiting in the airport hangar attached to the red carpet and a military fence made up of 27 naval soldiers who play the salve of honors.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in marine blue, and she, the princess, melena to the wind, very sober, does not use her usual 'peep-toes', they had communicated that in the DF threatened storm.
They give the photographers a smile and a standstill before they go to the room where the official attend.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the city’s four biggest, a Mexican television reporter awaits them.
The Best Fashion Award
There is probably no more suitable place in the world to present a fashion award than Paris and possibly no more exquisite living designer than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to boost the international projection of new fashion talents.
It is awarded a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her designs in the Mango cabin at No. 54 of Paris’s Haussmann Boulevard and almost cried out of excitement.
By the way, it is the company’s second largest store in Europe and has just opened with 1,335 square meters of area.
The first is in London.
So many events, coupled with the desire to thank the designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the competition, made us end up in a luxurious dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris.
With the proximity of the most exquisite Chagals, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango, looked even more spectacular.
Nati, with the heart shattered of grief and making heart shakes, for her brother’s recent death, put on a House suit and some ELAH adhesives, which cut his breath, and his son Luis’s arm – a cannon of almost two meters in length – accompanied Valentino in the presidency of his tribute dinner.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, did the honors and is so gentleman that he ended up, along with the baron of Rotchil, without a jacket, because both had borrowed them to two ladies.
Mónica Cruz, who went to the store with pants and shirts - of her own design - and for dinner turned with a long black sexy dress, was excited when on the night walk by the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they taught us the ballet rehearsal room and she, recalling other times, grabbed to one of the bars and made a 'grand plie' hide.
Inés Sastre did not stay on the walk through the palace dependencies, but before showed us on the mobile phone photos of his son.
The next morning we were able to delight the sight with the presence of Olivier Martínez - another cannon that moves on a motorcycle - and by John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel of Paris, with his sweaters, his towels and having previously asked, that there would be no odors in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, that is life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not a thousand but a thousand more ways to forget the chaotic and frenetic everyday life.
And if it were little, everyone is gathered in a book that will bring the relax to the bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock almost punishes when it rings every morning at 7 a.m., but it’s even worse to imagine yourself embroiled in the hectic rhythm that the current life imposes.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are no one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the problems of disconnection with the world of work.
No, the number rises to, nothing more and nothing less, than 1001.
Alongside yoga positions, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of possibilities adapted to the taste and minutes of each.
The anti-stress work is called “1001 Ways to Relax” and its calm will reach the bookstores from the editorials Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone considers that it is not possible to tranquility in areas such as work or through personal relationships, this ‘manual’ denies such a belief.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as being in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline no longer runs through your veins to restore body balance and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, disconnect your mind and focus on reading.
Speaking asleep
Some children talk at night.
I’m not referring to those who wake up very awkwardly telling us something that happened the day before, but to children who talk while asleep.
The first time it happens, you may get scared, but it doesn’t really matter.
It is a benign sleep disorder called somnilochiae.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I’m sure more than one has told him that he spoke overnight.
This phenomenon can appear very sporadically (once in a lifetime, for example, associated with a high fever episode), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the next day the child remembers nothing.
There is no single cause for its appearance.
Often they are related to other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night terrors, night enuresis (to get sick) or sleeping, but it has no reason to be so.
As we mentioned above, they can also be associated with very high fever, stressful situations or over-excitation.
This is a very little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
It may be that you speak in a quiet tone, loose words, a whimper or the opposite (crying, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where the manifestation is very intense it would be advisable to observe the child and consult with a specialist, to check if there is any issue that is generating a lot of anxiety and gives him out of this way.
We have said that it is a benign disorder, therefore it has no treatment, unless it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with sleep apnea or a stress picture).
What can be done is to consider a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child too much before going to bed.
So look for quiet games and avoid programs or television series that are frightening or a bit violent.
With children who are very nervous and who find it hard to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them acquire some inner calm.
This will help the child to have a quieter sleep.
Once the somniloquies appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless for the child and that the next day he will not remember anything of what happened.
Useful Advice
Do not wake him.
It is useless, because he is not conscious, and you will break his sleep.
Even though he is speaking, he is sleeping and therefore is resting.
Remember that if you are very anxious during several episodes, it would be advisable to consult or find out what generates so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what you say (which is not the most common thing), do not fall into the temptation to make an interrogation to give you information.
You won’t get anything, because when you’re asleep you’re not conscious how to organize your thinking.
Moreover, you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he is dreaming to say that, so be very careful in how you interpret the information and with the conclusions you draw.
Never tell a child that you can question him at night to know his secrets.
Not even a joke.
That creates a lot of anxiety.
In short, don’t worry, it’s not bad, it’s an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern finally!
The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found the way to victory on its field after a long period of shortage.
Without making a good match, the team created many goals and was able to score a goal to win the match.
The rhythm was not very constant during this meeting in which the aggressors had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann to scratch the squad with a shot from afar, Illhaeusern was almost going to take the "power" and by turn Fonderflick from afar, then with Hirn up, Romain with the tip of the foot or also Diebold came to prevent Dannemarie's defense.
In front, we didn’t let the midfielder pass and left only Riahi in attack position.
The beginning of the second half was crucial, first with two goals from Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the scoring for the Illhousiens with the Marais goal, well-positioned to pick up the ball rejected in a first attempt from Diebold (53 ').
But the goalkeeper Illhousiens will not be able to taste his happiness for a long time and will be forced to return to the gardens a dozen minutes later and leave his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie won't take the opportunity and it won't be a problem for the eleven illhousiens who backed a little to "compress" their defense, except in the last seconds of play during which, after an important blade, the ball passed very close to the crossfield.
Sarkozy finds angry fishermen
Before heading to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a tour of Britain.
In the face of the resistance demonstration by fishermen who heavily disrupted the entrances of several Breton and Normandy ports last Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go last Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, to meet there with his representatives.
They promised to welcome him "with a constructive spirit" and hope that he "comes with concrete propositions".
This presidential visit coincides with the general meeting of the “crisis committee” created by the Breton fishermen to measures against the increase in gasoline prices, which marks a record by reaching 1.14 euros per litre.
According to the Elysée spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies become competitive again and to save the conditions of employment and remuneration of sailors."
Fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out operations to reduce traffic on the Morbihan and Calvados, which have resulted in blockades of 10 km.
The sports port of Quiberon has also been blocked, but connections to Belle-île have not been stopped.
A “filter barrier” has been laid in the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors already showed their determination on Monday by burning, at dawn, tires and wood pallets in front of the fuel deposits of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic coast and the Channel, such as Les Sables d'Olonne, in Vandea, where the bous stayed in the port, or Le Havre, where about twenty ships blocked the movements of the trade ships.
Fishermen from La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loira-Atlantic region, stopped in the afternoon the blockade of the important Total refinery in Donges.
Fishermen from Boulogne-sur-Mer have decided to wait until the ministry’s meeting on Wednesday to consider possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the “crisis committee” will have to think on Tuesday about the development of the movement and its participation in the planned meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen have not abandoned" and "they do not want to move toward Paris," announced for example Liliane Cariou, the chairman of the Lorient fishing committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay gasoline taxes, currently pay around 50 cents per liter but consider that the financial balance point of a boat can be reached only with a gasoline with a price of less than 0.30 euros per liter.
The Great Paul Newman
The unforgettable performer of “Two Men and a Destiny” has died of cancer, at the age of 83, in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and also Sam Mendes greeted the film legend and committed actor, Paul Newman, who has passed away at the age of 83.
Embraer keeps its delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian airline has delivered 215 aircraft this year despite the threats of recession that weigh on the global economy.
The fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, Embraer,ins its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, Embraer president Fredrico Fleury Curado reaffirmed.
During the first half, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer relies heavily on the Chinese market to sell aircraft ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG plans to sell more than 15% of its assets
Insurer American International Group, which has been pulled out of trouble thanks to U.S. monetary authorities, plans to sell more than 15 percent of its assets with the aim of repaying its $85 billion loan, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is willing to study selling most of its services beyond its international life insurance and retirement insurance in the United States.
AIG’s board of directors met last Sunday afternoon to examine possible sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation was obtained from AIG.
The assets from which AIG intends to separate include its air leasing subsidiary, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the insurer Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the Financial Times adds.
No final decision has been made on these sales, pursues the Financial Times.
AIG must quickly raise liquidity to repay its $85 billion loan granted by the Federal Reserve at risk of seeing U.S. authorities take 80% of its capital, diluting it with the right proportion among current shareholders.
Historic Session of the Paris Stock Exchange
The New York Stock Exchange accused of a historic fall on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson’s plan to save banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss ever seen on the stock exchange of almost 800 points, and the Nasdaq lost 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Index fell from 777.68 to 10.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the most significant fall in its history (684.81 points) had been recorded in the past on September 17, 2001, the day in which exchanges started again after the terrorist attacks of September 11.
The Nasdaq, a technologically dominant index, fell 199,61 points to 1,983,73 units and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index 8.81 % (i.e., 106,85 points), to 1,106,55 units, according to the final figures of the closing.
Already depressed by the crisis at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the House of Representatives unexpectedly rejected the plan to save banks that would have allowed to regain some stability in the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favour, the representatives denied U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
“That’s not a good signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan,” estimated Lindsey Piegza, of FTN Financial.
"This shows to what extent the market had this plan," Lindsey Piegza added, fearing a project adopted within several days would arrive "too late."
"If the project is really dying (...) the Fed and other central banks will quickly take the relief (the U.S. central bank, the N. of the Network) to manage the crisis, which would tighten credit conditions further," warned Brian Bethune, head of Economy and Finance at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the feeling of urgency, “every day that passes is announcing the fall of a financial institution” in the United States, Ms. Piegza stressed.
Following Washington Mutual’s bankruptcy last Friday, authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia’s banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated dramatically, provoking emergency interventions to benefit banks in the UK, the Benelux, Iceland and Germany, which shows that markets are facing “not just a crisis in the US but a global crisis,” added the analyst at FTN Financial.
The bond market has risen dramatically.
The yield of the 10-year treasury bond fell by 3.632%, against 3.827% on Friday afternoon, and the 30-year bond by 4.161%, against 4.357% on the eve.
Obama wins first television duel
At the first Friday debate between the two candidates in the White House happened another to know who has triumphed between Juan McCain and Barack Obama.
Not surprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this television duel that has been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen says McCain’s performance, although honourable, was “not brilliant enough” to allow him to slow down in polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion poll published last Saturday gives Obama five points of advantage (49% versus 44% for McCain), judges that it was the Democrat who went well.
Among the indecisive voters, who are the ones counting, Obama came out winner with 39 percent of respondents, while 25 percent of them grant McCain the victory, according to a CBS poll.
Obama could confirm his advantage on Thursday with the expected good performance of his fellow candidate, José Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
He has good instincts," Bill Clinton predicted this weekend.
The seventh-year-old McCain highlighted his undisputed experience in foreign policy, highlighting his opponent's "ingenuity" on these issues that were at the heart of this first care.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand what...” he has accused several times.
"I don't think Sen. Obama has the experience and knowledge needed to be president," he said.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in republican television advertisements.
Obama said he represented the future.
Without being confused, he was concise and accurate.
He highlighted his ability to make good decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain has not yet understood, while Obama has already understood," he replicated, this weekend, in a Democratic television advertisement blaming the Republican for not considering the importance of the impact of the crisis on Americans.
“During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama said yesterday in front of 20,000 people who had gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina under a rainy rain.
He did not pronounce the words "middle class" or "workers". "The financial defeat clearly favors Obama, who is considered by Americans as the most capable figure to save the economy that is on the brink of the prey.
"Next week could be a decisive episode," estimated, yesterday, influential and Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the Democratic candidate, the current financial disaster “is the final consequence of eight years of a bad economic policy put in place by George Bush and sustained by Senator McCain.”
Reaffirming that he would nevertheless reduce the taxes of 95% of Americans despite the Wall Street riots, the Illinois senator also noted that the realization of an eventual energy independence of the country thanks to the promotion of renewable energies was his first priority, with the creation of a security and health system.
McCain wants to build a fleet of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Prudently, both candidates shunned the issues referring to the $700 billion ($470 billion) financial bailout plan adopted yesterday afternoon by Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, “Have you noticed the elections in Minsk?”
Young people and opponents demonstrated last Sunday afternoon in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the legislative elections.
Some hundreds of Belarusians gathered on Sunday afternoon from the closure of the polling stations in Minsk’s central square to protest the fraudulent character of the legislative elections.
While no outcome had yet been announced, numerous young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "The dictator has to resign."
Some acknowledge not voting: “Why, since they will do what they want with my vote,” says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has put a good face on foreign observers in order to renew contact with the European Union is willing to make a democratic change.
The sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections are considered clean for observers.
It was not according to the opposition.
"We have been placed by the side of the election commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the vote count," Youri Potemkine, a spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous group of twelve parties, said.
“It’s a cosmetic change,” stresses Alexandre Milinkievitch, a former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, because what matters is who counts the votes, and in our house, it’s the executive power.
If some opposition deputies enter parliament, it is because they have been appointed but not elected.
“But their entry into parliament can mean television appearances, meetings in the regions, and bills.”
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because "it is necessary to start the dialogue with the European Union.
Because if our economy, which has a lot of debt to Russia, goes into crisis, and if we do not reform, we are at risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which followed the election process, will not recognize the validity of the vote.
It stresses that the participation figures seem too high, and that the generalization of early voting (the 26% of voters in Minsk) favoured the manipulation.
Ask the Social Democrat leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five deputies from the opposition to parliament, the ones that are best suited to power.”
The silence of the night is back again in the square of October.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate themselves on his success.
The Interview - Blood Is Safe Again
Héma-Québec celebrated its 10th anniversary yesterday, and its president, Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, because Héma-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, it regained public confidence that had been seriously vacillated by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this drama and the dissatisfaction of the public, the government of Canada made in February 1994 a public survey, chaired by judge Horacio Krever, intending to clarify the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and to formulate recommendations for such a disaster not to be repeated again.
While Judge Krever was delayed to present his relationship, certain provinces then created a committee aimed at planning a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mission.
As a result of Gélineau and Krever’s reports, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Héma-Québec to supply Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and both territories.
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec started its activities, almost 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, recalls Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
After making a lot of efforts to improve the safety of blood products and a lot of work over the years that followed, we have recovered public confidence,” he says before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, 94% of the Quebec population had subsequent confidence in Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary reminds, however, that “confidence is something extremely fragile.”
Since its inception on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, we witnessed in Europe the birth of numerous cases of the human variant of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says Décary.
And we didn’t know if this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
Then we rely on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which when we do not know it and when a serious illness can emanate from it, in this case the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, we impose exclusion measures.
In April 1999, we denied the blood of people who had stayed in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
But, a few years ago, it has been shown out of all doubt that this disease is transmitted through the blood.
This episode showed us so that the precautionary principle that was applied made sense.”
In 1999, a much more sensitive HIV detection technique appeared on the market: nucleic acid tests that allow to detect directly in the blood of donors the presence of the virus and not the presence of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used until now were based.
Nucleic acid tests have shortened the period between the time the person has been infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
We were able to reduce this period by less than a week.
This substantially reduces the risk of certain donors being infected without knowing it and being unable to detect them.
These improvements significantly lowered the risk of contracting AIDS through a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
“This means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission by a blood product occurs.
I believe that one can today receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover health without worrying,” says the head of management of Héma-Québec.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen could emerge in the system.
Last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Reunion that, for example, the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We need to be constantly vigilant,” Dr. Décary continues before emphasizing that in addition to a safe supply, Héma-Québec must also provide sufficient supply.
“The demands are increasing because the population is ageing.
As the most aggressive anti-cancer treatments, patients often need an injection of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also has consequences on the blood donor network that agglomerates on average only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation.
All persons with good health, aged 18 and who meet the eligibility criteria can however donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer their blood are not accepted, because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they traveled to a country where malaria reigns, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
“With this 3% we manage to maintain an inventory that covers the needs of hospitals.
The shortages are very rare.
But members of this network of donors must be renewed as they get older and can no longer donate their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but above all to retain them and encourage them to be a regular donor.
Since current life is very unrestricted, we rarely find the time to spend an hour donating their blood,” grieves Francine Décary.
With a budget of $297 million annually, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone envelopes, heart valves, eye balloons and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, transformed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public umbilical blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered biomedical waste is filled with a rich blood of stem cells that can be used for the treatment of serious diseases such as leukemia.
“We celebrated a few weeks ago, the putting on the bench of our thousandth sample of umbilical blood and is expected to take more than a thousand of these per year.
We should start proposing it for injections early next year,” says Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood-taking program as very popular.
“Many moms are disappointed not being able to enjoy this,” as Héma-Québec lacks the resources to propose this complex and costly program in all Quebec hospitals.
Softball - The Impact in the Semifinals
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semi-finals of the USL First Division eliminatory series, thanks to a 3-1 (4-3 in short) victory at the expense of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during the second and decisive game of the quarter-final series, at Saputo Stadium.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal at the 90th minute of the game.
After the first half without a goal anywhere, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino created many goals.
Roger Levesque was the only one to beat Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Remember that during the first game of the series of going and going matches on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the Seattle suburb.
The impact will be measured at the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-final.
On Saturday afternoon in Minnesota, the Thunder lost 3-1 in the return match to be taken by 4-3, but the Whitecaps accessed however in the semi-finals by 5-4.
The Impact should face the Whitecaps next Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In short – the victory goal of Kovalev
The Canadian number one trio is ready to start the season.
The composite unit of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the attack in a 3-2 win from the Canadian to the barrier free shots against the Florida Panthers yesterday night at Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec accumulated two aids, and Kovalev picked up a pass in this win, the fourth of the Tricolor in six preparatory matches.
Kovalev won by scoring the only goal.
“I’m not ready yet, the Russians warned.
“I need another game to feel comfortable.”
He tried to play the maximum in the first half, Guido Carbonneau recorded.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a beautiful applause.”
Charest takes care of the north
The prime minister does not rule out the possibility of elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party ends, Jean Charest went yesterday to Juan-Talon, Quebec, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc (left), tries to be elected during today’s partial election.
Rejecting the boundaries of our last great northern border: such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual strength staying in the broad lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, images were projected.
They showed, on three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric, mining, Quebec, seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
as well as during the electoral period.
The prime minister thinks the elections will take place this fall, although he showed that his schedule was very crowded.
The "Northern Plan" is the fourth side of a "vision" that the prime minister intends to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes an agreement on labor with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmony with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the prime minister’s recent speeches, the opening of the North – the northern territory to the 49th parallel – had never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister limited himself, however, to explain why the North was "a jewel to the immense potential", but did not give a term, amounts of investment, or precise priority on future projects.
What could above all be more developed are: hydroelectricity, forestry, but above all the mining sector, doped by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond," according to Mr. Charest's enumeration.
This “territory twice as large as France”, “is our home, it’s in Quebec.
Not only is it our home, but it’s in us,” he insisted, as to show that he sought a national founding myth.
Quebec was built a lot thanks to its relationship with the North, he stressed: the riot towards gold at Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
“It belongs to us, it’s our future,” he added, after taking a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70 percent of Quebec’s territory, comprises a portion of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister said during the press conference.
“This is a traditional position that all governments have repeated.
There is a border line on which they have not agreed for a long time and, when the opportunity comes, I reiterate that position on the part of the government," he said.
Moreover, "with climate change, we need to rethink our Northern vision," he said, speaking of the northwest passage, which will open every year due to the melting of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister considers that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The prime minister said the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former deputy of the Quebec party of Ungava), have already started consultations with about thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role began some work.
The prime minister does not rule out an important meeting, "not necessarily a summit," but a meeting at which "a common vision will be given."
The development of the North would be done in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan “will be concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly,” he promised.
Jean Charest described this “vision” as one that is in continuity with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
“Like the liberals who preceded us, we have thought differently to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was one of the recurring topics of the weekend, which began Friday with a great cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival to power in the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Central in the Adélard-Godbout Basin.
"From Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, in Lesage who made the Revolution quiet and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Bourassa who made the James Bay our party knew how to forge the future," declared Juan Charest.
In the press conference, she invoked another reference, that conservative, the "Roads to the North" program by John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
Touching the topic of Eastmain1a-Ruper’s hydroelectric dam project, Mr. Charest stressed that its commissioning is scheduled for 2012.
"This remains among us, but I expect to be there," he told his militants, provoking applause.
Indeed, the prime minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of launching a vote this fall, which the law allows.
He stresses that his schedule is however full, due to a Federation Council mission in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The general council of the weekend supplied the liberal chief with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, "constitutional aspirations" that had no trouble being accepted: the Liberal Party of Quebec claims in particular the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also wishes that Quebec name members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that they have a veto right on decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, we welcomed the large lines of the Northern Plan with skepticism.
The leader of the Quebec party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, coming to power in 2003, renounced its application.
If he had done so, "we would make progress today," Marois said alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (vote today), Françoise Mercure.
The Quebec Democratic Action seemed to support the adoption of a Northern Plan by the government.
"But what is desired is that this is not just a show," said leader Sebastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who is coming back from vacation today.
Letters - a dishonored country
It’s Mr. Vic Toews, former “Justice” minister (oh irony!) in the Harper cabinet, who was allowed last summer to say that Luisa Arbour was a “shame” for Canada.
To dishonor this woman who fought an unceasing struggle for justice and who deserves all our admiration for what says everything about the relationship between the prime minister and Stephen Harper.
We are facing a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated their national who is locked up in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
It’s a government that doesn’t take into account in any way the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the facts he is accused of happened.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, rejects its promise and leaves a child-soldier living in inhumane conditions.
The only one who chants with false justice to assess the accused’s guilt.
Remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, support Omar Khadr’s repatriation in order to benefit from a fair trial in Canada.
It is this government that shuts its eyes on torture: it doesn’t care that a young adult is psychologically destroyed, undoubtedly forever after so many years of executions.
We still don’t realize that, but we are witnessing at this time an insidious erosion of our rights, of our freedom and of our “democracy,” that’s the word Harper continues to repeat and that doesn’t make sense.
The time has come when no morality exists anymore: we can arbitrarily abuse, torture, imprison a Canadian citizen as the government chief, who is so far a minority, wants (what will happen after October 14?).
Many voters believe they will find salvation in a party that praises virtue, law and order: they do not see that this government has given up what was doing the reputation and dignity of our country.
Mr. Toews the shame is caused by this resignation and nothing more.
The Orwellian Discourse of Barrick Gold
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice president and director of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold claims that the world’s largest gold company attempted a defamation trial of six million euros against three authors and a small publishing house in order to provoke a “transparent public debate.”
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of persecution for defamation, but the law.
Not surprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to hurt anyone who dares to hold a position contrary to his?
The outcome of the trial is of little importance, the authors and the publisher of Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums in order to prepare their defense and to fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the bottomless pockets of the mine.
The tactic, in these unequal battles, is often consisting of ruining the defendants in order to impose a friendly settlement that will stifle the opposition in addition to frightening anyone will dare to examine the matter again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was before the public that he would have had to present his view of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in several of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are usually made by the exchange of ideas and not by clutches.
It was enough for the mine to open its books, its records, and set up a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications, and funding independent search teams that could have clarified the matter.
But Barrick Gold seems to not trust public opinion and rejects petitions and support letters for Noir Canada authors.
Could Mr. Garver possibly explain how he can call for a “public” debate by disregarding the opinions of the latter?
According to the vice president, this word seems to refer only to high-paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; that represents a very limited view of the concept.
In democracy, detractors also have the right to speak.
What he doesn’t understand – or what he doesn’t want to understand – is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does so mainly because it rejects the brutal way of mining.
This audience is willing to listen to Barrick and judge him, but based on civilized changes in arguments, and not in the framework of what many people perceive as a persecution-morning (pursuing the “public debate”, Barrick Gold has just filed a request with respect to Noir Canada’s authors intimidating them not to use this word anymore).
In addition to Mr. Garver’s surreal speech, Barrick Gold’s process is a direct attack on the freedom of university search and truth, essential to all democratic societies.
It denies the right to cite credible sources and to make a debate about the facts and interpretations, which represent the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that disagree to the rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, under the penalty of many persecutions, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do so following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have a right to respond.
The university world, to which we belong, has long known how to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s exaggerated persecution clearly shows that, contrary to what he intends, he has no desire to make a transparent debate.
It’s a loss for the university world, but also for the public debate in Canada, and it’s time for governments to put in place devices that limit this kind of abusive persecution.
Wall Street rescue operation: Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most important economic bailout plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to curb the financial crisis that has shaken Wall Street for months has yet to be confirmed by both houses of Congress.
It provides in particular for: better control by the elected of its implementation, new mechanisms aimed at ensuring the refund of the public money invested, new provisions to contain the number of houses barred the lack of payment, as well as a right of taxation on wages paid to the leaders of the saved companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a two-day marathon of negotiations.
“We have made great progress towards a deal that will be effective in the markets,” said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
“Everything has been done to cover up the economy and ordinary Americans in the face of the current Wall Street crisis,” she said.
"It's the fundamental point: if we don't do this, the trauma, chaos and disruptions on the daily lives of Americans will be immense," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had ended very quickly in the last few hours because they feared the effect that would provoke a new failure in the mood of investors.
The last time they had set was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates in the American presidential elections, who have joined the negotiations late, were rather favorable to the agreement, but did not forget to express their dissatisfaction with being forced to reach this extreme.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama was given certain arrangements to reach the agreement, the one that would allow owners to keep their homes and the one on the salary of the executives of state-supervised companies.
“When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is no need to be congratulated.
But these measures are necessary,” he commented on American television.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, asked on another channel if he would vote for the proposed plan, responded that: "I would like to see the details, but I hope to vote for it."
"The important points I read [show] that it is something we will have to digest and with which we can move forward.
He said the option of not doing anything is unacceptable.”
The $700 billion plan aims to buy from taxpayers’ money the dubious debts, risky assets and non-selling assets of American financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis provoked by the eruption of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of risk mortgages before spreading to other more common forms of credit bonds (PCAAs) and provoked a freeze of liquidity and a breakdown of banks and financial institutions.
It is a group of elected Republicans who had changed the first draft agreement last week.
We believe we’ve come out of the stagnation since Democrats accepted that certain “toxic” assets from companies in trouble are only insured by the government, rather than purchased.
With the aim of limiting the hardships for everyone in Congress, we also added a provision that stipulated that if the government had to assume losses for five years with this program, it could impose new rates that would aim to help it recover money.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first portion of $250 billion to which another $100 billion may be added if the president considers it necessary.
The payment of another $350 billion would have to be confirmed by another congressional vote.
In exchange for their help, Washington will get shares in the rescued companies that will be worth dividends in case of profits and that will be able to re-sell when the storm is over.
The federal government will have the possibility to delay the procedures of embargoes concerning housing obtained with real estate loans under this plan, as well as to set limits on remuneration and on compensation paid to the leaders of the companies affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see it submitted to the voting of the House of Representatives from today and the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all his efforts, he is still not sure that his plan will be approved.
Some people continued to protest yesterday against this project, both on the part of the Republicans and Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, declared to his voters that "with all evidence, Washington does not want to understand."
“We have a very serious financial problem.
There are some solutions.
But not that which consists in taking advantage of the taxpayers.”
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, who is an animator of a small group in Congress, presents the problems differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred economics professors, including three Nobel Prize winners, wrote to us to tell us: we ask Congress not to rush and carefully examine the path to take,” he said.
At this same time, in Europe, we once again had the proof of the global nature of the crisis.
Following an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the banking group Fortis for €11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it had given up buying its bankrupt competitor since it lost €2.9 billion during the U.S. risk real estate loan crisis.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is part of the 20 largest European banks and the 10 largest insurers.
"This is not lost money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said.
Instead, we have a right to vote and influence in the bank.
It’s just something that savers and families would appreciate now that times are uncertain.”
During this time, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank suffering from the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all outstanding loans at the bank Bradford and Bringley and more than 41 billion euros ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and bank accounts of the British bank.
The Bradford and Bringley bank would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an Icon Compromised
His blue eyes represented for so long his triumph.
Had the American actor with a charming smile freed himself from his narcissistic side?
Yes and no.
His pudor, his sensitivity and a talent that was evident will also have removed him from the record of power that the true sacred monsters have.
What a great corner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday, at the age of 83, from lung cancer at his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the fast years.
He is less phenomenal than Brando, to whom he looked much and who was considered for a long time as a rival in cinema, more prudent in his play, more fragile, but also apostle of freedom and the outbreak of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes wonderful kids.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, of a German Jewish father and a Hungarian-born mother.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American Dream.
No exaggerated ego, last mark of quality.
Because it projected a whole country in love with the self made man, the Pacific War Fighter, wounded in combat, who at the beginning of the 1950s studied dramatic art at Yale, then frequented the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing in the theater, television and soon in the cinema.
This man who fought for civil rights was also the car driver who ranked second in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1979, twisted by a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
With him the secret sides of this secret, discrete and committed star disappear, allergic to the scandals of the world of the spectacle that we do not know very well.
He is an honorable man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman’s death has caused the filmmakers to vertigo this weekend, as his big roles on the black screen of memories are shocked.
More than half a century of the seventh American art in perpetual shift parades through it.
Many memories come back to memory as the cowboy with charm of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in Tennessee Williams's 1958 Zinc roof-adapted Gatsby.
Nearer to us (1990), we evoke his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
Others like Paul Newman have gone into the history of cinema.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Robert Wise's Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role intended for James Dean, repeated after his death, which truly launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic manger in the sumptuous film The Sting, Oscar for best film in 1973.
Bitter billiard player and avenger in Robert Rossen's great film The Hustler (1961), he will repeat the character in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earned him in 1987 his only Oscar among nine nominations.
The person who changed over the years was he.
still him.
Time changes during his career.
Young people know him especially thanks to George Roy Hill’s Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans saw him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy by the Coen brothers.
With a last role as the Irish mafia's stepmother in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003, the rice was ripped.
Contrary to several film legends that soon abandoned the career, Newman remained much in the world of cinema, denouncing Hollywood, its ores, its fasts and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, with humor, "as a challenge that lives in "the underplaying" and that judges its performances too supported.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the papers came for a long time without doing anything.
However, he interpreted less often the role of a young man than of a marginal: neurotic, alcoholic, cowardly or desperate, whose traits reflected rebellions.
As a filmmaker, Newman revealed his true, not very well-known, pudic sensitivity.
Her film Raquel, Raquel, in 1968 (according to the Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with her wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, described a female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott due to overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son in 1984, work of pudor and sadness.
Among the numerous tributees that unleashed yesterday for Newman, his great friend and former gunmate Robert Redford (who had worked together on The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) affirmed, very saddened: “My life and my country were better thanks to their existence.”
Generosity, love of existence are important traits of the deceased actor.
On the other side of her legendary career, he also hides a great militant for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a contestant against Hollywood’s excesses.
We have long seen her face reign over the saucer, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging this method as a method of bad taste, although it started as a gag.
The proceeds from these sales were donated to his Foundation for Disadvantaged Children.
Newman, rather than content with his myth, will have committed to the end.
She left her five daughters a letter containing these sentences: "Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there.”
And it’s a privilege for us to have followed the career of such a lucid and generous American artist.
A model citizen.
What was produced in the facturing factory Zuschlag &amp; Co. ?
Very soon, on 8 October, criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of committing fraud of significant harm, in a business manner, continuously and in an organized manner, in addition to other crimes, including the counterfeiting of documents.
According to the Prosecutor’s Office, the funds obtained in public contests were used for their own purposes, justifying in many cases the fulfillment of the tasks with false invoices.
Public funds and municipal funds – in total about 65 million HUF – were partly left in the treasury of the Fiatal Baloldal organization and partly in the pocket of private individuals.
The method, which was also made known by the researchers, was to justify the collection of funds obtained in public procurement with false invoices behind which there was no real execution, the different associations never fulfilled their obligations assumed.
According to the prosecution, most of the bills were fake.
To do this, the talonaries were obtained in the Józsefváros District market and the circular seals were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question of which company to carry out the counterfeit invoice was decided, among others, on that tour of the Upper Balaton Region where János Zuschlag sent István Lados.
The latter confessed that for this purpose he had to choose hostels and restaurants.
He asked for invoice for his consumptions and these served as a model for the invoices they presented, among others, in the competitions of the Ministry of Youth and Sports Affairs, in the Ministry of Social and Labor Affairs, as well as in the City Council of the Capital.
These invoices were mostly signed by István Lados and his accomplice András Őri, who according to our information rather wrote the reports needed to obtain the public subsidies.
During one of his "study trips" Lados chose a brewery.
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and his accomplices, this gastronomic center provided food for a group of ninety people from the Association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
However – according to the center manager – so many people don’t fit in that place at the same time.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb Jövőért Foundation – later called Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért – was filled with formal and contextual errors.
For a hostel in the town of Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and more than ten people could not stay there in one night, however in the bill stood one hundred and thirty people.
But the fancy billmakers also exaggerated when they pointed out to the gastronomic center Pigal Kft. because in the bookstore of the same - according to the information given to the Prosecutor's Office - there were no documents on behalf of Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá.
Győző Farkas, the manager of the company, informed hvg.hu that when he was quoted by the prosecutor’s office and shown the invoices, he already knew it was fake documents.
"On the seal the name of our company and the NIF appeared in the wrong place."
He added: in addition to the formal problems, he did not agree that according to the invoice, 100 people were housed, since they have only eleven rooms in which there are not so many people.
In addition, meals were included in the bill, while the restaurant has not been operating for a long time.
The enthusiastic bill makers were also not informed that the travel agency chosen in Budapest exclusively organized trips abroad, so that on the cash payment invoice they foolishly indicated a trip within Hungary as a service, which also did not coincide with the agency’s practice of invoicing.
In addition – as it was known during the investigation – they included VAT in the document as well, despite the fact that travel outside the territory of the European Union were exempt from taxes.
Among other things, the measurement of VAT was also incorrect in the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. for the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, since the services of that company are not charged with a 25 but only with 15 percent of VAT, in addition the hotel employees only issued machine-made invoices but the invoice was manual.
In addition, the "expedients" also committed other mistakes, such as in the case of a company in which they put on the invoice as an activity carried out by road to which - it was known during the investigations of the prosecutor's office - the company founded as an investment consultant does not.
Equally due to formal differences – inadequate format of the invoice, false seal – it was known that the invoices issued for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, for XXI.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives denied having issued those invoices.
The counterfeiters also did not pay attention to the fact that when the Fiatal Városért Egyesület group ate there (2001) the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in the process of liquidation, so the liquidation process manager - according to our information - denied having issued such a document.
Consciously paying invoices
Another group of manufacturers of fake invoices are those who were aware that they had to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of Fiatal Baloldal – Ifjú Szocialisták, issued an invoice worth about four million HUF on behalf of the Együtt Foundation to Harmadik Évezredért.
The manager of Collab Kft. – according to the indictment – was persuaded by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, to issue fictitious invoices.
Similarly, Biogate Kft., currently under liquidation, collaborated with Zuschlag and its accomplices, which in 2003 supplied invoices worth approximately five million HUF to the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány, the Atlasz Egyesület and the Vörösfenyő Egyesület, with no real economic activity behind it.
There was no movement of capital either, because afterwards they canceled the prepared invoices but forgot to make this entity recorded in their documents.
The next group of manufacturers of fake invoices includes those who have some link with the accused.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the plaintiff of the Ukrainian manager of the Delta Trio SL with a fictitious headquarters in Budapest, which dealt with fuel and vehicle trade.
This company issued numerous invoices worth approximately 18 million HUF in the months of October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer media.
According to the investigation data, these bills were purchased by Cash Investment Kft. in Kiskunhalas, which has been under liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The manager of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov should have dispatched the documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued in the name of the company invoices for the Atlasz, for the Hoppá and for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, collecting the amount himself.
Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian farmers at the express request of Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies worked effectively because – according to the accused – they did not get a job.
But he took advantage of these companies, as at the request of his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who prepared the company's registration documents, issued invoices on behalf of the companies for the organizations linked with Zuschlag: for the Atlasz and for the Y-Generáció.
Kubatov, on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, gave a total of 15 invoices to different entities worth HUF 14.2 million.
The Prosecutor’s Office found that Kubatov received VAT and 10% of the amount of the invoices.
That man even took advantage of the company in command Szi-Beri to issue fictitious invoices used in the Biztos Pont contest.
The Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted a contest in January 2006 to Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA), a public utility entity of the Socialist Party.
They received 500,000 HUF respectively from the tender, but did not use the money for the purposes of the tender.
To prevent this, they submitted to the TMA five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft.
These were the invoices found during the registration of the office that Árpád Kemecsei had at the headquarters of the Ministry of Education.
Part of the accused will probably report in the trial – as they did at the Prosecutor’s Office – the course of the counterfeiting of the invoices.
The most interesting will be the confession of the main accused János Zuschlag himself, if he decides to dismantle everything.
For his confessions have so far not been very detailed and although he has repeatedly promised to speak of everything, this has not done so far.
The question is: what interest does he have to do so? because in exchange for the refund of most of the money – fifty million HUF – the socialists have reached an agreement with him so that Zusi assumes all responsibilities.
Who, on the other hand, for these days even could offend himself, since to ease his prison conditions he requested house arrest, but was repeatedly denied.
While the numerous perpetrators of very superior economic crimes, who have never returned the money, pass freely or at least can wait in their own home for the sentence, he has no possibility for that.
Overlapping Psychology: Why do we spend more money?
Participants in auctions are likely to spend more money and overvalu the product.
Neuroscientists and economists at the University of New York discovered the neurological-economic foundations of this well-known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to the study appeared in the journal Science, people don’t want to lose in competitions like eBay auctions, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
Scientists tried to establish the neurological scheme of this “game” through experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played lottery, the other participated in a auction and in the meantime the functional magnetic resonance imaging system (fMRI) examined the active areas of the brain of the participants in the experiment.
In both games participants could earn money, but during auctions, where it is a fundamental element to bet more than the other, when losing the game intensified the functioning of the complex called stratum located beneath the cerebral cortex.
This area of the brain, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the "self-price" mechanism of the nervous system.
According to the scientists, the increase in bets is explained as a prevention to not provoke an intense reaction of the layer.
To support their theory, the economists of the scientific group also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In this experiment, three groups bet against one person in different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed of the actual value of the product in question, and its members made a bet.
Another group was also promised that if they won, they would receive $15 more in prize.
Instead, the third group received exactly $15 before the auction, but in case of losing the auction the members of the group lost even that money.
So the only difference between the two groups was that for one the triumph was highlighted and for the other the failure.
However, checking the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the group who played "against failure" were willing to bet even more than the members of the control group and the "winning" group.
"These results cannot be deduced from any previous economic theory.
Those who so far explained the phenomena of auctions only with the joy of winning and with the prevention of risks.
Only visual neurological methods helped solve this contradiction between the two theories, so we now come to a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, a professor at the University of New York School of Economics.
Hepatitis: When to go to the doctor?
In the world about five hundred million people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary chronic liver disease is considered one of the leading causes of death.
The number of infected in this country is estimated at 100,000, but only seven thousand are treated because many of the sick do not know they are infected.
Hepatitis is the common name for various liver diseases caused by viruses.
The symptoms are very similar; liver infection and ictery are characteristic, but their pathogens and the diseases caused are very different.
Hepatitis viruses in dependence on the pathogen spread in two main forms: hepatitis A and E by food (e.g. with water or food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and with body moods (sperm, vagina mood, saliva).
It is recommended that travellers protect themselves against the A and B viruses; there are no vaccines against the C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after consuming the infected food, it is manifested by a general illness, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After this appear on the skin and in the white of the eyes yellowness, the feces become clear, the urine is dark and healing can last even two to three weeks.
Every year one million people die in the world from cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B, the most severe forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that according to the calculations, only one in ten infected receives pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without treatment it can cause liver cirrhosis and even cancer.
Most infected people do not know that they are sick because this pathological agent gradually destroys liver cells and often the first symptoms only appear 20-30 years later.
Therefore, early detection and systematic medical check-up are very important.
This disease is much more common in three groups: people who had blood transfusions before 1991, drug users and those who wear tattoos.
There are currently about 200 million people in the world who suffer from chronic hepatitis C.
As this disease can be discovered with a routine laboratory check too, it is worth consulting with your family doctor if you experience any unknown symptoms.
The disease has cure if it is discovered in time, it is possible to exterminate the virus from the body, so it can suppress the contagion and prevent cancer.
The 30th of September is World Hepatitis Day, which was organized for the first time in 2004 by organizations representing the sick.
Its aim is to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver infections caused by viruses and the importance of their premature recognition.
Does it hurt those who believe in God?
According to the results of a recent research, religious faith has a calming effect that also relieved the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment: they analyzed how religious belief influences human pain, the British newspaper Telegraph.
In the context of this singular experiment, they applied electric shock to 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists, while all were looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the human brain scanning technique, it was possible to verify that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain.
This experiment is the first of a series of researches in which scientists, philosophers and theologians from the different departments of the University also participate alongside academics.
The analysis occurred as follows; they fixed a sparkle instrument to the patient’s left hand, which applied the electric shock.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to look at two paintings; the Virgin Mary, a 17th-century work by Sassoferrato, and Leonardo da Vinci's 15th-century armor lady.
The researchers had the hope that the show of the Virgin Mary would provoke a certain religious encouragement among the faithful, while they chose Leonardo's oil because it wasn't too different from the other, and thought it had a reassuring effect.
The patients spent half an hour on an MRI scanner, receiving during that period 20 electric shocks in four consecutive parts while observing the religious-themed painting or the other.
Catholics stated that when they looked at the Virgin Mary they felt “safe” as “protected” people, they “reassured themselves and peace reigned in their hearts.”
When they looked at the religious theme picture, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they looked at Leonardo’s work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any such shocking image you can a similar effect with atheists too, you just have to find the right image.
"We should find the portrait of a person for whom they feel very positively, like for a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
Anglican bishop Tom Wright celebrated the outcome of the investigation.
"The practice of faith should and in many cases truly changes our personality," Wright added.
After these formidable results there is only one question: what effect would it have on the regulation of pain if the faithful were shown the Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of his size?
Would the vision of a high-quality Virgin Mary bring even better results?
You are what you say about yourself.
On its 10th birthday, Google can say: you can find it in people’s pockets as well as in the sky above their heads; you know where they spent their holidays, what doctors they visit and what interests them.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company’s executives, this is not yet enough.
On the other hand, skeptics who make a parallel to the Orwellian vision do not see the essence of the Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently stated to the Financial Times that the main goal of Google is to gather as much personal data as possible about its users, and this is necessary to be able to meet the original goals of the founders of Google: "we gather all the information in the world in one system!"
According to the leader of Google, the company even after ten years of work that revolved the World is still in the early phase of the endeavor to be able to process all the information.
Asked what would happen in five years, Schmidt replied: “I would like Google to be able to answer questions like “What to do tomorrow?” or “What would be the job that would best suit me?” – however, software won’t be able to answer questions that seem so simple as long as there’s not enough user information.
Not all Internet users are aware that during their browsing on the Web the keywords searched, IP addresses and pages where they went when they finished the search are accurately stored.
Thanks, for example, to Personalized Search that debuted two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, they can re-consult what they were looking for before, what they opened and thanks to this history will generate much more personalized searches -in this same logic will be based on the Recommendations, in which the system will offer us products and services based on the previously defined and stored preferences.
What if they take advantage of my data against myself, if they collect information about my activities? - ask those users who are concerned about seeing the information monopoly of Google.
In most cases rather the potential represented by the company is what can be fearful and not remorse, fear of punishment, longing for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is a fact already confirmed that they not only preserve, but in justifiable cases also assign to third parties all the expressions sought, in these cases there is nothing that protects the personal rights of the Internet users.
The most debated example of recent times was the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, when Google handed over to the Brazilian government the information on its website, called Orkut, to identify pedophiles.
Instead, people who care about people’s rights, in May, were relieved when the company together with the EFF, an organization for the defense of electronic rights, successfully demonstrated before the court that it was right in its litigation with the FBI: according to the judgment, it will not be able to force Google, by any of the points of the constitution to provide any type of information requested in secret by the FBI.
(At the same time the federal government managed to get under the pretext of strengthening the child protection law passed years ago, about fifty thousand Web addresses and about a thousand search phrases, but without getting the search lists of individual users, nor the full lists of Web pages and keywords of the last two months.)
So the opinion about Google is quite contradictory: it is criticized by those who fear to provide their personal data because they think that their privacy, their privacy is damaged by starting to use the services of Google, and rebelled against it as against the multinational companies of conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, internet users and users from other countries, see in them the future generation, the "vanguard corporation", not so their rival, Microsoft, cataloged by their Windows as the conqueror of the World, no matter how much they both struggle for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask users for any identification code, nor money for their applications, the code is open and the free program package, constantly updated and looks more youthful, more collaborative than the practice of the official software giant.
But it may also be because geeks see with precision the very problematic relationship existing between human rights and the Internet that was produced precisely by one of the most mentioned keywords in recent years: the Web 2.0.
The Web 2.0 is about collaboration, leaving intentional footprints behind us and taking advantage of the communication channels available, and while the measurements of these vary individually, the essence remains the same: showing ourselves.
A normal young person can have a profile on numerous collective pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and can even join them with other services, such as Twitter or last.fm that offers list of their music customs, then they can include them in a tracking system like FriendFeed or Blip.fm, can also have a blog, in which the most recent photo galleries that are stored on Flickr or Picasa appear automatically.
We can know numerous cases from which it arises that for example the girlfriend, by seeing the flow of photographs the next morning of common friends, finds out who spent the night before her fraudulent boyfriend or can dismiss the employee of a company because he writes his sincere opinion on his blog about the direction of the company: one thing is certain, the definition of privacy has been completely revalued.
A person’s “on-line” life is what he shows of himself – this is the definition that lies behind the behavior of today’s youth.
And whoever wants to hide something, or at least intends to evade the monopoly of Google, can do so (beginning for example with the Scroogle that uses the Google search system, but does not leave traces).
There are many people who do not want to register on the collective pages to avoid being able to find them, but they can replace Google's "on-line" applications, from text writing software to image and news reading apps with alternative versions which do not connect to gigantic servers or prepare the most perfect profile possible about us.
Public opinion is almost openly waiting for the day when Google will show its true face.
The company with its current value of $156 billion is worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars), AdWords/AdSense advertising surfaces threaten the revenue of advertising agencies, while services that are increasingly rapidly introduced cause serious headaches not only for Microsoft, but also for numerous other software developers.
Critical observers, however, will find the alarming contradictions too: for example, the top management roughly rejected the employee protest after doubling the price of the company's nursery, considered too expensive the unlimited number of employees' feeding, but all this is nothing compared to the fact that in 2006 Google ceded to pressure from the Chinese government and the company under the agreement filed all information that violated the good morals and interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company’s internal regulations says they won’t announce any new service in advance, but only when it was already ready to operate, which if it’s certain is that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years may revolve the World: while some believe that the scanning and archiving project of Google’s books and magazines will acquire such dimensions that the company will soon be quoted by the U.S. Supreme Court, others fear their Health system, because in it we can create our own complete health profile, with previous analyses, with our doctors and our problems.

Two minors helped erase the footprints of the author of the double murder in the city of Ózd.
Police questioned two minors about the double murder of Ózd who, according to substantiated suspicion, helped wipe out the footprints of the crime, a spokesman for the General Commissioner for Public Order of the Borsod province said on Tuesday.
The young women acknowledged the crime they were charged with, and are currently accused of committing the crime.
The two minors – according to the Hungarian news agency reports it is two girls – will be able to defend themselves in freedom.
For complicity, they can get up to 5 years in prison.
The accused of the double murder of Ózd - a 23-year-old man - has been in custody since Sunday.
He is accused of murdering several people with premeditation and greed.
During the investigations it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum to a 53-year-old man.
The accused did not want to pay his debt, so on Wednesday last week he cited his creditor to the headquarters of a company in Ózd, where he killed him and then killed the victim's 9-year-old daughter.
According to information from the MTI, the young man prepared much earlier to commit the crime, since he committed the murder with a weapon previously hidden at the crime scene.
The police investigate the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange offers to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros — about five billion Czech crowns — for one hundred percent of the stock of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles, despite the fact that the Czechs have previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which within a few months wants to sell 60 percent of the shares.
The Czech economic newspaper E15 that the offer of the Poles has been the highest among those offered by those interested in the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, so far the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Stock Exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have offered.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that the worst new owner would be the Warsaw Stock Exchange and did not rule out the possibility that the Prague Stock Exchange would disappear in the future.
Experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at about 5 to 10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders’ agreement, approximately 90% of the shares could be sold.
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is investment bank Patria Finance with a stake of approximately 25 percent, followed by Banco Ceská Sporitelna with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the perspective of the European press
Major European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday devoted to the ever-deepening international financial crisis speak of a "second September 11".
The global financial catastrophe is due to the U.S. president, the president has not even been able to get his own party’s support for the rushed bill, which aims to solve this desperate situation.
Instead of a new “Pearl Habor,” of which billionaire investor Warren Buffett spoke, it is more correct to talk about a “second September 11th.”
According to a portion of the Madrid press, Washington is the expiatory chief.
In the opinion of El Mundo, the mistake of the political direction of the United States was the one that brought the world economy to the brink of the abyss.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. monetary system is increasing and this will later affect the entire world.
Although Bush’s plan was not perfect, after the congressional vote the danger arises that Washington does not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air—just when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
We cannot ignore this threat, notes the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states today can still throw a lifeguard belt on thundering financial institutions, saving them from bankruptcy with taxpayers’ money.
But if as the dominoes collapse more bank yet, then neither the new funds nor the new improvisations will be enough.
In the long run, EU member states need to put aside their nationalist egoism and centralize control over the fragmented financial markets.
The financial institutions in crisis received more than €100 billion on Monday alone, the Viennese newspaper Der Standard recalls, adding that concerns are increasingly real that, as the Americans did, European taxpayers will also have to pay a lot of money to solve the crisis.
The EU has so far not seriously dealt with the crisis that is passing through the Old Continent.
The “saviors” will not have to immediately present hundreds of millions of euros, but it would be good if they defined: in what cases is it justified to use taxpayer funds to avoid a greater evil?
The smart car imitates the flight of the bird
What would be the best method to develop technologies in order to avoid collisions, if not the imitation of obstacle sensors existing in nature?
For example, those of the beetles.
In a surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, the beetles provided the starting point for Nissan engineers to design the next generation of collision prevention systems.
Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the nature-imitating BR23C car robotic steering system, which was given the characteristics of beetles, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that can evade all collisions.
During flight, each butterfly creates its own particular oval space that actually looks a lot like our safety protective capsule - explained at the exhibition Kazuhhiro Doi, technology director of RP and development and research.
A major role is played by compound eyes that are able to see in all directions at a angle greater than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of compound eyes, the engineers used the laser beam length measurement system.
This identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C within a distance of 2 meters, at a angle of 180 degrees, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the vehicle’s microprocessor that immediately turns into a manoeuvre to avoid the collision.
In a fraction of seconds the obstacle is identified, then the vehicle robot imitating the movements of the beetles, changes the direction by turning the wheels to the necessary extent.
Unlike any existing system today, this manoeuvre is entirely instinctive.
“If it didn’t, the vehicle robot’t be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the vehicle robot project.
You must react immediately and instinctively, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable inner layer of the safety protective capsule, in a layer within which currently all kinds of collisions are considered inevitable.
The whole process should reflect what a beetle does to avoid other beetles.
This process should be done in an open and closed eye.
However, unlike beetles, the movement can not be directed upwards, downwards or diagonally, but can only be two-dimensional and exclusively in the direction of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the endless possibilities that exist for the cockroaches to avoid other cockroaches, here they only used as a possibility for the car robot the rotating movement and acceleration as well as the braking.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy density, meaning they have a longer life than lithium-ion batteries.
According to Andoh, the important thing is instinctive and intelligent reaction and not the ability to process data, much less the ability to store it.
This device every second only needs to process some input signals and react accordingly.
It is not necessary to store this data or react with an instinctive logic based on the data of the previous manoeuvres, so it uses only a few dozen kilobytes of memory.
No gigabytes or megabytes are needed.
This is the first step to develop the technology to immediately evade obstacles, which according to Nissan’s calculations, within ten years will be able to be incorporated into mass-produced models.
Another possibility for its application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to his destination, avoiding obstacles on his way.

The written version of the law of the $700 billion financial bailout package has been prepared that will be applied in several phases with the purpose of buying bad credit from banks.
In the first phase, half of the money will be spent.
During the new consultations that lasted until after midnight on Saturday, congressional leaders reached an agreement around the $700 billion financial bailout package in total, after several days of discussion, Reuters.
We’ve made significant progress,” said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic president of the US Congress, saying it’s just about to formalize the deal in a document.
The commitment on the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, the Minister of Finance, speaking about the outcome of the compromise stated: this program will work and will be efficient but other measures are needed.
The written version of the package was released before the opening of Asian markets, i.e. Sunday before 8 p.m. on Washington time (i.e. before 2 p.m. on Monday, Central European time), without causing a spectacular leap in the stock markets.
On the draft law called the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, Monday will be voted first by the U.S. Congress and then the Senate.
President George W. Bush on Saturday night consulted with Pelosi and then the White House also celebrated the news about the deal.
"We are pleased with the progress achieved overnight and highly appreciate both parties' efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said.
The program is different from the Bush administration’s original proposal to spend all of the $700 billion to buy poor-quality credit fund securities.
Now only half of the $700 billion can be spent, using $250 billion immediately after Congress votes, probably on Monday, of this sum the Ministry of Finance will buy bad-rated credit fund securities and the fate of another $100 billion depends on the president’s decision.
This program will be controlled by a special body, in which the president of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of the $700 billion could be spent after a new Congressional decision.
According to the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy bad loans, mortgages and credit fund securities, in addition to other "poison" type loans as well.
The purchase can be made at auctions or directly - informed competent persons of the ministry.
The law allows affected companies to participate in an insurance program where the financial portfolio guarantees the worrying elements, for which companies will pay the amount corresponding to the foreseeable damages.
Henry Paulson stated that the law thus ensures the necessary financial means, that can even reach $700 billion to meet the urgent needs of the U.S. financial system, whether it be the purchase of bad financial means, their insurance or the prevention of risks that could cause the collapse of some large financial institutions.
We do everything necessary to be ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed, he added.
Instead, the heads of the banks who are in trouble and waiting for state aid will be able to count on the official limitation of their compensations, which the American argot simply calls gold parachutes.
Only in certain cases will the payments be limited, and the limitations depend on the form of aid from the Ministry of Finance.
The limitation means that if the ministry buys under an auction, an extra tax will be imposed on the gold parachutes, unless the bank’s failed chief is fired.
By directly buying bad loans, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that boss compensations are not exaggerated.
In addition to the above, existing gold parachute contracts will not be changed, but restrictions will only apply to new contracts to stimulate participation in the program.
This is the first case in U.S. history in which a legal limitation on general directors' income will be in place, said Barney Frank, chairman of the Congressional committee responsible for financial services.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares of the banks participating in the program, so the risk of taxpayers will be reduced, as ultimately they will even be able to get profits from the transaction as soon as the economy and the bank recover.
According to the bill, in the next five years, the president will have to submit to Congress a proposal on how to reimburse the financial sector’s losses to taxpayers.
Of course, there were those on both sides who expressed their reservations regarding the project.
This is not what the American citizens have commissioned us, that is, they are not protecting the taxpayer’s dollars,” said California Republican congressman Darrell Issa.
His Ohio Democratic colleague Mary Kaptur said the measures were urged by those who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Will I no longer need a visa to travel to the United States next year?
Kinga Göncz believes there are many possibilities for the US-Hungarian visa-exemption agreement to come into force around January 12 - the foreign minister spoke about it in Chicago, before Hungarians residing there.
In his opinion, "practically everything depends on the time to build the electronic access and control system on the other side of the Atlantic."
At the same time, he warned that in the new system will disappear the premise of entry, but tourists before their departure from the country of origin will have to register.
The Hungarian Foreign Minister is holding talks in Washington.
He will interview Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice with the Middle Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary and hold negotiations with the international policy advisors of the presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favor of the bank rescue package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both presidential candidates for the two major U.S. parties, assured on Sunday their support for the administration’s $700 million banking aid program, but there are politicians who demand the resignation of the Treasury Minister.
Representatives of Congress and the administration, after several days of marathon-type negotiations, on Sunday morning announced: an agreement of principles was reached on the bank rescue package.
The financial package aimed at solving the Wall Street crisis and unfreezing the frozen credit market became the central theme of the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to show that they are more capable than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, by putting economic issues in the forefront, Obama regained some advantage and disappeared McCain’s advantage that he had obtained after the Republican convention with Sarah Palin’s candidacy for vice president.
At a Detroit campaign rally last Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress will quickly pass the $700 billion package law.
He pointed out that the proposal includes those consumer protection points, which he himself supported.
"We have to act now and with responsibility (...) the employment, the savings of you. plus entire industries and the stability of the entire economy are at risk," he said in front of a crowd of 35 thousand people.
He did not miss the opportunity to call McCain’s economic concepts obsolete.
In an interview with ABC, McCain explained that “we’ll all hardly swallow this (...) but not doing anything is simply not a viable path.”
The Republican senator said that the proposal includes the establishment of a supervisory commission to the minister of fines and the limitation of executive compensations, he was the one who insisted on that.
Obama told CBS that McCain played no important role in the consultations, but he consulted daily with the minister.
Congress president Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that congressmen are likely to vote on the bill on Monday.
Press magazine of the German speaking area
The right-wing group is intact, only that within the group itself became the most conscious voters - says Der Spiegel on the weak CSU election result in Bavaria.
Haider and his followers are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a red-green coalition.
by Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the electronic edition of the left-wing German magazine Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution Eats Its Parents" he analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known politologist, the erosion of the CSU had begun long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber had taken over.
Social Christians for several decades were developing Bavaria – and now it is just these modern citizens who give it their back.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as is Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but on Sunday a process that had been forecast for almost a decade ended: the undisputed hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU gained 47.7 percent, for the first time below 50 percent since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago, in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, even during the so-called Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consequent modernization of the CSU in the devorating province of its parents.
Sociologists have already predicted this for 40 years, but in the pace they have been very wrong, however, the secularization, the results of education and the settlement of the Northern Germans in the developed regions of Bavaria have had their negative consequences on the loyalty of the CSU voters.
With modernization the possibilities also increase and this also has political consequences.
The right-wing group is intact, only that within the group itself the more conscious, more critical and more stubborn voters have become.
It is surprising that in the last few weeks just the conventional groups of citizens have been the ones who have moved away most from the CSU; the self-employed, the small industrials, those who have bachelor’s degree and the diplomats.
So the support for the CSU fell to less than 40 percent.

The Vienna Conservative newspaper: "Who with whom?" in its article entitled "Party presidents are very reserved on coalition issues" - deals with the confusing situation of domestic politics after the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ from meddling in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open in all directions to negotiate, but the Greens still do not want to consult on the coalition.
Elections have already been held, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the party leaders barely let some of their barracks be seen.
SPÖ president Werner Faymann has confirmed that he wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to demonstrate that collaboration between the two parties is possible – it already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman asked if he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, as deputy chancellor.
He argued that in any case they disapproved of the Schüssel-Molterer era.
This political trend cannot be followed.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
He said that cooperation will probably not be successful if Faymann tries to interfere in ÖVP’s internal affairs.
It is still open in the party whether they will choose the opposition or enter the coalition, these issues must be discussed without a doubt, within the ÖVP itself.
BZÖ President Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to take responsibility from the government," Haider said.
The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken.
Today the European Summit for Equal Opportunities has begun in Paris, its host is France, which this year is also the turn president of the European Union.
Lívia Járóka, member of the European People’s Party for the Fidesz, in her message to the plenary, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, drew attention to segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations that strike Roma children and is also the biggest obstacle to the prevailing foundation of their interests.
This high-level conference was inaugurated – on behalf of the French Presidency – by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Employment and Social Affairs, and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Representatives of governments, European social partners and representatives of the leading European organizations for the protection of social rights attended the meeting.
Járóka - according to the press office of the Fidesz group of MEPs in the European Parliament - warned that in addition to discrimination in employment, Roma are left out of the labour market primarily because of their low schooling level.
“The majority of young Roma have not completed secondary education and due to the poor quality of basic education, only an insignificant portion can obtain a university diploma.”
Járóka also pointed out that education, as a fundamental human right, has a determining role in the prevailing foundation of other human rights as well.
Investing in the education of Roma children at an early age can strengthen the economies of the EU Member States.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these issues widely, both among Roma and among non-Gypsy.
The sooner a Romanian student starts school, the more chances they will have to become an active member of the labor market; through income and consumption taxes they will also contribute to the national budget.
“The Roma, as citizens of the European Union, must be assured of the right to quality education and guaranteed the abolition of segregated and low-level education,” said Lívia Járóka.
The objective and active unity of the European Union is necessary to immediately accelerate the processes of school segregation, for which the correct compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is of fundamental importance.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, we must offer Roma children the possibility that guarantees the democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as full-fledged citizens," Járóka said.
The aim of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, organized annually since the Berlin meeting last year, which was held in the sign of the “European Year of Equal Opportunities”, is to ensure a unique forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities at the European and national level of the Member States.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
In late October, a decision will be made on the fate of the failed duo Huber-Beckstein
Despite the severe electoral defeat, heads have not yet been cut in the Bavarian CSU summits, for the time being the debate on personal issues has been postponed.
Erwin Huber, party chairman, and Günther Beckstein, provincial prime minister, are still in office, but it is not known how long the grace will last.
The fate of the duo, who suffered a catastrophic electoral defeat of 17 percent, will be decided at the extraordinary party congress that will be held on the last weekend of October.
The members of the critically criticized duo let intervene: they do not stick so much to their positions.
With it they intended to reassure the furious members of their parliamentary group and their base organization, who a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago – although under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber who was at the peak of his career – the social-Christian union reached 60.7 percent, but now, a year after the coup attested against Stoiber, they have only achieved 43.4 percent.
The CSU for 46 years had a “monopoly” in Bavaria that gives 18 percent of German GDP.
Although in the Southern province, of key importance for the Hungarian economy, the Conservatives continue to prevail, in the future they will have to make a coalition with someone.
As a first sign of the party's restructuring, Vice President Horst Seehofer, federal agriculture minister, one of Huber's possible successors, also has a position in the reduced intelligence group that initiates negotiations with the liberal FDP and right-wing Free Electors on a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange thing about fate is that on the list of the Free Electors enters parliament that Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was exploited for the coup by the duo Huber-Beckstein and then cruelly wiped out of the stage the ambitious local politics.
The CSU’s top leaders are now investing all their energies to stabilize Beckstein.
Stoiber, who has so far been moving the ropes in the background, the former head of provincial government and former CSU president called September 28 the bitterest day of his political career.
Huber made some critical remarks on Monday to the CDU, in his opinion they would have deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning for the CDU and for Angela Merkel too.
After the September 2009 Bundestag elections, Merkel will not be able to be chancellor unless they are able to boost together the CSU that played a transcendental role in the national election successes of 2005.
According to Merkel, she could hardly hide her disappointment over the failure, the losses of the CSU will not negatively impact the great Berlin coalition.
What, of course, is relative: it will not be easier to treat the wounded CSU and the social-democratic crisis continues.
The SPD with 18.6 percent achieved its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
The opposition of Lukashenko: 110-0
After the elections on Sunday, there will be no opposition MPs in the Belarusian parliament.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by the well-being and stability that Alexander Lukashenko guarantees in the country, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained rather by the violations of the law committed during the counting of the votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election result.
While the country’s ten-million-member legislature, comprised of one hundred and ten deputies, has no opposition for more than a decade, before yesterday’s elections the united opposition under the name of United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) hoped that Lukashenko, who for the fourth time renewed his mandate after the 2006 elections of dubious legitimacy, as a result of the constitutional amendment this time would “allow” the entry of some opposition deputies into parliament.
So the ODSZ suppressed the boycott that it originally wanted to make.
At the bottom of the opposition’s expectations was that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia – which took credit to moderate the increasingly expensive natural gas imports from Russia and which contributed to the sale to Russia of Beltransgaz, the owner of the gas pipeline that passes through the country – wanted to improve its relations with the European Union, which does not allow Lukashenko and other high-level politicians entry because of a political regime considered antidemocratic.
It was a sign of discouragement when the OSCE, when evaluating the election campaign, placed emphasis on positive phenomena rather than errors – such as the ban on participation imposed on a third of the opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE primary report on Monday criticized even the campaign itself – in which opposition candidates could not appear in the press – and especially that the opposition could not be present in the vote count.
With all this in the opinion of the opposition there is an improvement in the political climate: political prisoners were released and Minsk is ready for a small confrontation with Moscow, denying the recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus theoretically constitutes a federal state - has already a month considering the two regions as independent.
"We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has begun," Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable to maintain this situation, despite the fact that “the regime fears to allow the entry of even one opponent into that parliament without weight.”
The opposition does not plan to organize demonstrations of protest by seeing the results, rather it tries to bring to the voters its message about the need for economic reforms.
- This clearly causes us many problems because we must print the opposition press in Russia, the local authorities put difficulties in its distribution, but even so I see that there are more and more who support the change among the elderly too - said Milinkevich, alluding to the fact that Lukashenko's regime, which believes that its main result is the creation of social security, is not considered appropriate even by the retirees, who are officially the most subsidized by the regime.
Due to the country’s indebtedness and rising trade deficit, it’s only a matter of time the breakdown of social security that “appears to the silence of the cemeteries” – said Milinkevich.
Russian observers, unlike the opposition politician, called the election democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: “People don’t believe in words but in deeds,” so the lack of opposition is nothing more than a testimony to the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, you eat breakfast before you start working"
It has never happened in the history of Chigi Palace that they put automatic doors to control the entry and exit of staff.
But from today it starts with this measure against who fit and then goes to the bar to have a coffee in working hours.
This was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta and by the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
“Automatic doors,” says Brunetta, “are a tool for working better, with greater productivity, more presence and more services,” the minister said.
“Now a new season of responsibility and transparency opens up.
This is Reformism,” Brunetta stresses again.
With Palacio Chigi the installation is completed in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi, “the choice of automatic doors is also important from a symbolic point of view.”
No resistance has been found by the employees, the secretary-general says: “It has been a change shared by the workers and there has been collaboration from them.”
In short, no more breakfast in working hours; no more coffee and lunch.
Brunetta said, “A good cappuccino at 7 am is a holy hand.”
During a convention at the Higher School of Public Administration
In Rome, the minister declares that "in three months the absences due to illness of public employees have been reduced by 50%, that is, 60,000 more people to work in a year".
It is necessary to make public administration more efficient.
In Italy, “which wage dynamics – explains the minister – in the last 8-10 years have been double compared to the private sector and well above the inflation rate.”
For now, millions of public employees have united to oppose the rules of the Brunetta decree by adhering to the petition backed by the Codacons.
“While the public service minister shows the numbers, the lowest absence from work due to illness – writes the consumer association – the population of ‘vagus workers’ is continuously increasing.
In Italy, millions of correct and productive civil servants have united to declare war on the illegitimate rules of the decree.”
In particular, the Tar would contest the exclusion of economic treatments aggregated for illness due to service; the extension of the hours in which the medical control visits of the sick employee are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions wanted by the minister.
Occupational Accidents, Napolitano: “Prevention crucial”
Every day, 2,500 work accidents occur in Italy, 3 people die and 27 are permanently disabled.
For 2007, Inail data effectively confirm that white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
These figures testify to the gravity of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic issue, today the Anmil celebrates in all provinces of Italy the 58th national day for victims of work accidents, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
“The worrying data spread by the Anmil and the same tragic news these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention in the workplace is,” said President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the President of the Anmil, National Association of Mutilated and Work Disabled, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expressed his “great appreciation for the constant associative effort in favor of prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, the assistance to the families of victims and the awareness of the public.”
“It has been manifested, a ‘basta’, sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, by their dimensions, arouse the clamor of the media and the participation of the public opinion, but everyday reality proposes us dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamics.”
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly a problem of resources: it is decisive to invest in training and information.
Particular significance are the numerous initiatives promoted in school for a more direct awareness of young people who enter the world of work.
It is a duty to keep the attention to the phenomenon alive, not to curb the alarm about social gravity, to apply and improve legislative norms.
For his part, House President Gianfranco Fini stressed “how the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each one of us and imposes on all institutions a determined commitment to urgently end.”
“Data on workplace accidents appear to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not take away that the number of white deaths is equally impressive,” said Anmil president Pietro Mercandelli.
We do not actually want this “diminishing tendency” to translate into less attention, because it is precisely when attention decreases that explodes the tragedy.
“We believe that at a general level too little is still done to counteract the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
They are necessary, at our discretion – Mercandelli stressed – greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the world of the school.”
“A further effort is needed – he added – as far as communication and public awareness are concerned.
But it serves, above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers with respect to a phenomenon that represents a social emergency.”
Mercandelli has denounced "the progressive deterioration of the level of subsidiary protection provided for victims of work" and the "assistance derivation towards which the system is being directed in recent years".
“The goal is to restore the worker the guarantee of the insurance – he added – because the fortune of those who are accused does not have to depend on the gift arranged by the legislator each time.”
MP3 readers under accusation, put the hearing at risk
Listening to high-volume music for a long period of time using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
In a statement released in Brussels, the European Commission cites the opinion of the European Union’s Scientific Commission on Emerging and Recently Identified Health Risk (Csrseri).
“From this scientific opinion – read in the note – it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable music apparatus weekly for more than an hour a day having the high volume apparatus risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity.”
“I am concerned that such a high number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and cell phones at a high acoustic level can unconsciously ruin their ears in an irreparable way,” says Meglena Kuneva.
“From scientific evidence – follows the responsibility of the EU – emerges a clear risk and we must react quickly.
What matters is to raise consumer awareness and make this information public domain.
We must re-examine, in addition, existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion, so that they are widely effective and keep pace with the new technology.”
Bruxel had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the large use of portable musical apparatus and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise that it originates.
“Scientists confirm that this is a cause of concern and the European Commission will now examine, together with Member States and stakeholders, what measures could eventually be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable music devices and related devices.”
Currently, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100 dB, but concern increases as hearing damage that may arise from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit these damages by resorting to solutions such as reducing levels and exposure time to noise.
According to the EU Scientific Committee, users of portable music devices listening to music at a high volume (more than 89 decibels) for only 5 hours a week exceeds the current maximum noise limit on the workplace.
Those who listen to music under such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing ability after a period of 5 years.
This means that it affects 5-10% of users of such devices and the number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Germany gives way to the Commission for the future of the capital
Today it starts, in March it closes, in June the accounts will be made.
This is the calendar fixed by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the future of the capital of Rome", which has been instituted this morning in its new headquarters behind the Thermas of Caracalla.
Within six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will discuss the main points for Rome.
Once the doors closed in March, the board and the municipal council will evaluate analyses and projects, in order to present in June the Strategic Piano for Rome with the "official bull" of the Municipality and its intendent Gianni Alemanno.
“The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas – German tends to emphasize – It must provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who decide politically, the board and the municipal council, can then endorse themselves.
There is no surplus position of roles, only the will to have a place where to elaborate a great project for Rome.
In March completed the works will disappear, because this experience must have a precise time-limit.
In June, we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome.”
To those who accuse the Commission of being useless, given that its opinions are not binding, Alemanno answers: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to carry out and the quality of its proposals.
If the quality will be present, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am also sure in Rome, your contribution will be crucial.
Almost always politics is crushed into ordinary management and emergencies that come back and forth.
We, on the contrary, want to look beyond and in the long run, in a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future.”
The intendant of Rome also tends to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless entity nor a banality: it is absolutely free, does not cost a single euro to the Roman citizens and will serve to make participate and reason the best minds expressed by the capital."
For German, effectively, "it is necessary to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or immovable, to allow our city to make an authentic leap of level, of which we have absolute need, thinking with a unitary spirit to its future."
A future that, precises the intendant of Rome, “will not be limited only to the current communal boundaries but will look beyond” not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital but “also considering the role that Rome can and must develop as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean”.
Obama is the first anti-American president.
He wrote a noted American politician who is interested in passing for independent: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions reduced the U.S. economy and tubed relations (as he does also today gives private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
The attacks on Obama are on the rise as the election date approaches.
A Miami lady wrote on a Web: “This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big stone face: he believes he will win the highest post in the nation that has had two black governors and five black senators!”
In fact, they are attacks that don’t say much; they are attacks clearly of a racial nature and don’t answer the voter’s question: Will he be a good president?
There are people who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the entrances of the southern United States, has written an editorial: Once in the cabin to vote we will know well who the American patriot will vote for.
One side of the American mentality has been covered up to the last.
"Say whatever you want, we will think afterwards where to put the cross, whether on Obama or on McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave America.
Things never said before now, that seems almost true the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these reasonings, the winning weapon for Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1,500 people: what were the mistakes Bush made during his tenure? 89% answered: Iraq.
Change in America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home on foot in the back.
In Iraq there are 4,500 soldiers who have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack their suitcases.
For most, Iraq has been Bush’s weak spot.
Whoever takes over the post of George W will have a huge duty to develop.
US, the economic collapse is felt also for journalists: in newspapers it is time for cuts.
Five hundred American journalists have been questioned by the PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and of mental control for the future.
Today, journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, journalists have not openly stated they feel less concerned about credibility.
They are not as isolated as they were once.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the room where the editors work to carry out the newspaper, is a big problem.
It’s a problem that needs to be solved, according to interviewed journalists, if you don’t want traditional journalism as the majority of the public understands to be substantially reduced.
A clear but complex pessimism prevails today over the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that national journalism is on the wrong track.
In the local field the executive group is 65%.
Printed on broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the web goes.
The largest publishing houses open a gap on the Internet, for many seen as the “killer” of the printed letter.
The “economic pressure” that journalists warn has risen to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope “that it does something good” for journalism.
The biggest divide in American journalism today is between those who run newspapers – that is, the directors – and the journalists who work for them.
56% of executives at the national level are confident that their journalists share the same values, while at the local level the percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this has to do with “work safety.”
Executives who plan to lose their jobs in 3 years are 47% nationally.
The number of journalists is 30%.
The "safe work" at staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work on a contract.
In a huge nation like the U.S., with 300 million inhabitants and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want and thus becomes a matter of “take it or let it.”
Directors almost always get good salaries, while editors can earn up to $10,000 a month, plus retirement and social security.
For holidays, reasoning becomes complicated: a total of days the first year, another after the third to reach 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by his admission, are “sick” continuously during the year.
It is all a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: Rome court, Danilo Coppola remains in Grottaferrata
The chairman of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the instance of real estate businessman Danilo Coppola who had asked to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in the field of the investigation into the counter-pact relating to the escalation of Unipol-Bnl.
In the course of the process of arrest to his charge, last week, he obtained the house release, transforming it into compulsory residence to Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate can travel the route from the city of the province to a room in the capital.
According to the court, these trips (which the PM has voted against) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence that accuses him.
Elites in Danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the $700 million bailout plan launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and this, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
We are confirmed by yesterday’s New York Times informing us that the ongoing crisis is disarming the Republican party, always more divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, on the other hand, conservative, hostile to “those of Washington” and the world of finance, strong above all in the states of the Center and the South.
The soul, in fact, has become prepotent with the voice of the one who spoke at the beginning.
This barely cited is only one example of the mutations, of the great mutations, that the ongoing economic earthquake announces: not only in the United States but in all the West and not only here alone.
In the United States as in Europe for a long time the crisis seems to function as an accelerator of incubation phenomena that with the new climate solidify and come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary reactivation, of the double state-sovereignty category in relation to a type of re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis, effectively, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions which have, yes, strong financial relations with the outside world, but above all, the balances of families living in a single country and in a single state are much more compromised.
The one that immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and those families who, on the other hand, are voters.
The crisis appears globally economically but is politically and exclusively nationally.
Political internationalism seems substantially out of play or they don’t have much to say: the crucial test is the European Union that divided as always between the different interests and the different state strategies does not reach to decide any common policy.
It is from the government of each state that everyone expects an intervention, rescue and reactivation plans, new rules and above all the subsidy of funds: from the moment that it comes to the cut is only the state that possesses the economic resources and the mass of financial resources to remedy things.
And they also possess the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of incalculable value, values under certain circumstances in which no market probably and no organization will ever be able to dispose in the same measure.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the nation-state is in perfect harmony, with the greatest importance as long as the new development of the economy tends to attribute to a factor very connected to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the network of ever more sophisticated technology, of the intangible, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to dominate the world, we realized that our future will instead have to account more and more with the little intangible things like water, crops and oil.
All things that, look, can be transported from one place to another of the earth but are equally united in absolute mode in a circumscribed space, a territory.
So whoever finds himself as a sovereign has many more cards than whoever is not, and whoever has the misfortune of living in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty that presagiated a fracture.
Whoever says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Policy and Leadership.
In this sense, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the objective awareness of the need for leadership, the request of someone who knows how to take the situation in hand.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing, inadequate economic leadership with many dark zones.
And together something deeper and in a certain sense disturbing: a discredit, an intolerance, an inadequate image, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class of the countries of the West in an increasing number.
It seems to advance ever more, in various places of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same as those of the social elites so far on the rise, the same way of feeling and being, their culture in the comprehensive exception of the term, to have done their own time and to be more strange to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in a few words, subterraneanly nourishes a ramified but powerful movement of deslegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which manifests itself in an electoral “revolt” or in the sudden changes in collective humors of recent times, from the conservative exit in Austria-Bavaria to the collapse of the social-democratic consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of the American congressmen against Bush (and capes also with the victory of the right in Italy that has something to do with it).
It has the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format would say any, make it ever more difficult to understand and then to represent, what from today is taking shape are the deep layers of Western society and that the economic crisis renews, increases and shakes potentially in excess.
In the face of all this, talking about a “mass rebellion” today is frankly exaggerated.
But having eyes open is not.
The super glue to walk over the walls
Overcome the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walk on the walls like the spider man.
It is the target of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has approached quite a bit.
With a sticker of only 2.5 square centimeters, scientists have been able to paste a body of 100 kilos onto a vertical wall.
The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is an evolution of existing ones that use a particular structure of carbon, called carbon nanotubes.
“The principle of the glue can be imagined as a series of tubes ordered like a pile of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of the gecks, covered with microscopic hairs that can ensure the animal a perfect adhesion.
Tests done on different materials, such as glass, teflon and sludge paper, have demonstrated that the new adhesive is ten times more potent than the legs of this reptile and at the same time "is easily taken off the walls," explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
“This material could be useful as a transitory glue,” adds Liming Dai.
Capes do, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are heat conductors and electric current.
Other applications could be related to aerospace engineering.
No superheroes at the moment.
OTHER INVESTIGATION - The University of Berkeley, California, is also looking for a new adhesive.
In an article in the journal American Chemical Society, scientists in California have presented a glue made of micro-fiber like hair that cleanses itself from dust during movement on a surface to always maintain a perfect adhesion.
Drugs: Never with fruit juice
Pay attention to apple juice, orange juice and pomegranate juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if taken simultaneously with some drugs, their absorption is altered by amplifying or decreasing according to the case, efficiency with serious health consequences.
To repeat the risk of fruit juices being packaged that fresh associated with the assumption of some medicines David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who from the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society ongoing in Philadelphia sends a new alarm: a glass of pomelo, orange and apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of some drugs, canceling the beneficial effects and putting the health of patients at risk.
Pomelo juice was already under accusation because it was held responsible for raising to toxic levels some anti-arrhythmic medicines, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurological.
The same Italian drug agency had given the news in a news bulletin two years ago alarming doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger that derived from this mixture and to pay attention to what you drink in case you are assuming a drug such as Diasepam or Metadone.
Not just the apple – According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit the drugs.
A long list of active substances inhibited by pomelo and other juices.
From here comes the call from Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology at the State University of Milan: “These findings are generally pointed out to the various international and national drug agencies that eventually provide to change the informative notes of the same.
Therefore, we must always read the illustrative leaflets of the medicines that are assumed and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not let us be impressed, clearly ask the doctor or the pharmacist” stressed the expert of the agency Ansa.
The Economics of Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics has been awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies, his models of trade and on the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a New Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a notorious New York Times publisher.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s economic and foreign policy decisions.
A few months after the September 11, 2001, Enron attack, Krugman had predicted in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in the end of consequence for the United States.
A prediction that has sparked much controversy and that for several years has been reproached to the economy, but now has been revealed to be accurate.
"I am surprised and a little upset by how the memory of the Enron and Worldcom collapse scandal has quickly disappeared from the public's attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of European central banking, Krugman is a “great-value economist”, but also a “very aggressive,” critical of the excesses of liberalism in the Bush administration.
Open Office echoes third edition of anti-Microsoft package
It is the day of the launch of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to attract more and more users, from home to office to the professionals of the public administration, as a free alternative to the well-known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work by volunteer developers, whose backs are overseen by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several new features: the welcome screen and the less rough revised interface are added to other more consistent ones, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Attention also put to the multi functioning with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific functions of some modules such as one that allows to reduce the size of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example, to send it via electronic mail, or the possibility of importing the PDF file into the graphic module, keeping the original appearance of the page.
Always on this front you can create "hybrid PDF" documents, which accumulate the typical graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text maker.
Collaboration is an element that has received different improvements inside the applications: in the calculation sheet can intervene in various users, avoiding conflicts of modifications, in the preparation of texts, each collaborator is given a color in the comment for a better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features to the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks should give the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded from http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and is added to the English version that was on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can also be sent home or to work.
And if the theme of free can be a hook for the dissemination in the houses, it is in the business area that Open Office the suite tries, attempts the big bet, and can already have several projects carried out in public administration and schools.
And there are not even realities that offer an ideal training, consultation and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, in which business prospects could be opened.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for video writing the corresponding of Word; Calc, is the calculation sheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for the presentation of PowerPoint; Dbase, in the case of the known Access is the program that consents to work on the database; and last Draw the graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that until today we have reached almost 3 million 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that the expected figure can be exceeded.
Kohl is the fourth case of doping.
A new positive case on the Tour de France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, team Gerolsteiner, third classified and winner of the best climbing remake.
This is by the newspaper L’Equipe.
Kohl, 26, is the fourth positive runner to the Epo of the third generation, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also from the Gerolsteiner.
The tests of Kohl's blood champions are among those carried out in recent weeks in the laboratory of Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If counter-tests confirm that he is positive, the Austrian will lose the third place at the Tour and anger against the two years of canonical disqualification.
To confirm the news of Kohl's positive doping to the third-generation Epo is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who has declared to the Associated Press that he has notified the news to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian has positioned himself on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, awarded the reboot of the best climber.
Immigrants: The New York Times Asks: Is Italy Racist?
Italy, a country of emigrants, has only recently become a privileged destination for hostile immigrants.
This is what the New York Times asks in a long article that has devoted to the debate on the topic of racism in Italy starting from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso murdered the previous month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case evidences what the New York Times defines as the "northern paradox": the northern regions are at the same time those where "more integration and more work" are recorded but also the country's highest anti-immigrant sentiment and the highest support of the Northern League.
As confirmed by the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times has also cited the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
not only .
Also the new legislation beloved by the League tightening the brake on immigration and facilitating the expulsion of clandestines is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
“Giorgio Napolitano, meeting Benedict XVI in Congress, has asked that the State and the church work together to combat racism.”
Students victims of expensive rental, up to 900 euros per room
The university rental market does not know the crisis.
According to the latest survey by the Sunia, the union of tenants, renting an individual room could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
“The phenomenon has already assumed very serious characteristics to the point of excluding the right to study a large part of young people for the very high costs that the family would have to sustain – explains the head of the study office of the Sunia, Laura Mariani – in these cities the strong demand has totally deformed the market to such a point that it has triggered a process of widespread increase even for residents.”
Apart from that in most cases rental offers contain a number of violations: free type contracts, unregistered, no limit of canon, sub-linked rentals.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions are needed that, through the revision of taxation, can regulate prices.
Looking at the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, they serve approximately 450 euros; for an individual room from a minimum of 650 (Bande Nere area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate area, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (in the Victoria area).
In Florence, a bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in the areas near the University, they pay 250/280 euros for a bed in a double room and 370-500 euros for a single bed.
In Rome in the central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Plaza Bologna) you are asked about 600 euros for a single room and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros for an individual room) in areas close to other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
Economy is made only if you change peripheral area: 300 euros for a bed and 450 for a single room in the area of Prenestina, Centocelle and surroundings.
In Naples for a bed you serve 300/450 euros, for a room you spend from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlínico, Vomero and Colli Aminei zones.
In Bari for a bed you get 250/350 euros, at least 350 for an individual.
In younger cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a greater weight on the city’s economy.
In cities such as Perugia, where the phenomenon of student and non-EU rentals is more common, an ulterior anomaly is recorded: an increase of 25/30% of the canon for foreign students with respect to Italians.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso, the cities cancel the historic rooms
Historic cinemas are closed favouring the Multiplex.
“A city without cinema in a blind city is like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by director Giuseppe Tornatore photographs effectively what is happening in the major Italian urban centers and also in the province cities.
The process of marginalization of the cinemas, which with the birth of the great meticons in the periphery and the consequent disappearance of the mono rooms in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear almost always are historical places, full of memory,"it is as if a friend died, a friend with whom a piece of place and so much emotion was shared," Observes the director of the new cinema Paradise, the film that twenty years ago won the cousin Oscar and the grand prize of the jury at Cannes, which told the poetry of a provincial cinema room and the nostalgia for the way of living the cinema that lost forever.
The figures given by Anec, the main association of merchants, are clear: in the past five years, 316 traditional cinemas have been closed, and the majority are paid for the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures are first, Emilia-Romaña with 82 cinemas less, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
It is a demonstration that the responsible for their disappearance is the advance of the multiplex, they are own these three Italian regions that have registered the largest number of new meticons cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany than in Emilia-Romaña.
“The Italian exercise has developed irrationally,” observes Paolo Protti, president of Anec, “it would be useful to build new structures but it would be necessary to guarantee the permanence of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all of its frequenters are willing to transfer to the meticons.
Not to mention the lack of funds in favor of traders: the previous debt of the state is approximately 10 million euros.
It is shameful from an ethical and moral point of view that the government does not respect the laws that exist.
To support the sector would serve between 16 and 18 million euros a year.”
Interesting the case of Bologna, the first Italian city to worry about the closures, decided to repair with the signing of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of this type in Italy to promote and protect the mono-sala cinema in the historic center and on the periphery.
Among the rules foreseen are mediated tax facilitations in favor of managers and advantages for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the traffic-limited zone and will have special rates for parking.
“It’s an initiative that I like,” observes Giuseppe Tornatore, “and I hope other cities will follow the example of Bologna by putting other measures in place.
It is true, that to contrast the extra power of meticons, traditional rooms have to improve the quality of sound and image because the audience today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Bagheria cinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to do the "New Paradise cinema", which I had already thought about 10 years ago.
I’ve lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I go in front of the Rialto or Quirinale de Via Nazionale already closed, where I’ve lived so many emotions shared, not to see the posters darkened by dust, I turn to the other side.”
Lazo between politics and 'ndrangheta, has been arrested the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to uniform the municipal elections for those interested in the Piromalli shelf."
Heavy are the charges that the magistrates of the anti-mafia direction of Calabria give to the intendant and vice intendant of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the intendant of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for mafia association.
Arrested also Gioacchino Piromalli, the elderly mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson lawyer, the same name as the boss, already convicted of mafia criminal association and to compensate 10 million euros.
"Despising any legal and moral norm, and of good sense," the prosecutors write, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay for consultations to lawyer Piromalli.
“It would have been allowed to the mafia family – the judges write – to officially enter the municipality facilitating the great possibility of control and command of the public administration.”
The president of the Calabria regional board Agazio Loiero does not hide that "deals between the organized bad life there are a lot" in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the deal is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of the ‘ndrangheta, heroes who keep themselves clean.’
The arrested this morning are added to those of last July after police had announced the head cut of the Piromalli mafia family.
Since the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had dissolved, already in 1991 and always by alleged conditioning between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been solved from the charge of administering the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, intendent of the Udc at the time of the dissolution, after the ballot in May 2006, had been elected as head of a center-right coalition.
I exploded a scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
I call on the deputy interior minister who at that time was Marco Minniti, accusing him of having organized everything for a political matter, but the judges in the arrest warrant signed this morning explain that Piromalli had even come to ask for the variation of the A3 road project.
From the environmental interceptions made to Dal Torrione, the judges write, emerges “the readiness to favor the demands of an entrepreneur, representative of a group very close to the Piromalli clan, uniforming the elections of the public administration over the interests of the mafia families.”
When the energy comes from the waves, the great ones come down to the stage.
It is an extinct site that occupies more than 70% of the planet’s surface and is now being discovered by the world’s major energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which the big ones like Chevron look.
The possibility of harvesting energy from sea movements has been studied for a hundred years and in the 1970s, along with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil was low, in 1980, the idea of leveraging marine energy was rejected, but now that environmental cases and the new rise of oil give momentum to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London has estimated that by 2007 15 percent of the world’s electricity needs could be covered by implants that exploit the movement of sea waves.
This would be twice as much as the amount currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And there would also be the streams and the tide.
Giants in attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy has been Enersis, which in 2005 has sealed an agreement to build an implant in the North of Portugal.
When the intention was announced it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years away to bet on marine energy are always more and among these companies the ones who have always voted for traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying technology on ocean energy,” a spokesman for a company associated with the US oil giant told the Wall Street Journal, “and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us.”
The cooperation in question is about obtaining a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission, to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It’s a pretty important signal, considering that in Alaska the US continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has activated a plan to carry out new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. in New York and Ocean Power in New Jersey are following the path of energy coming from the sea, the total invested so far, although no details indicate an increasing interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts speak of a technology still in the beginning, because marine energy has no doubt that it has a great impact on the environment.
For now, impacts such as those of the Portuguese or the Scots are of small size and do not seem to create big problems to the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a long scale, a technology with a greater environmental impact must be used.
And the options are several: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of goods joined between them.
The force of the waves, which makes the goods move up and down becomes hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders inside them.
The pressure causes a turbine to spin, which in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to the coast through submarine cables.
For now there are four implants of this type under development, waiting only for federal approval, apart from energy, could serve for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, is already producing power for a shopping mall and a parking lot, using submarine turbines on the East River of New York.
The movement of water when there are tide, makes the pallets of the turbines turn, creating a rotating movement that feeds the generator.
Verdant has said it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to use the energy.
After the waves, the mareas.
A particular interest, they say in the Institute for the Development of Electricity, deserves at this time the potential of tides.
While it is an intermittent phenomenon, tides are more preventable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It’s mainly about tide energy that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others approaching the coast, have invested $7.5 million in 2008 and a $35 million investment is planned for 2009.
