According to the Tatoaba guidelines, members are advised to either add phrases in their native language or translate from the language they understand into their native language. The reason is that it is much easier to compose naturally sounding phrases in their native language. When we write in a language other than their native, it is very easy to compose phrases that sound strange. We ask you to translate the phrase only when you know with certainty what it means.
