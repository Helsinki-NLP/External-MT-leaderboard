Spectacular jump in a "wingsuit" over Bogota
Athlete Jonathan Florez jumped from a helicopter over Bogota, the capital of Colombia, on Thursday.
Equipped with a wingsuit, he flew 160 km/h above the famous Monserrate Sanctuary, at over 3,000 metres above sea level, where many badgers had gathered to observe his feat.
A black box in your car?
While U.S. road planners are struggling to find the money to repair the decaying highway infrastructure, many are seeing a solution in the form of a small black box that hangs over the dashboard of your car.
The devices, which record every mile a driver travels and transmit information to officials, are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and government planning offices to overhaul the outdated system of funding major U.S. roads.
The generally uninteresting area of broad-based planning has suddenly provoked a lively debate and unrestricted alliances.
Liberals have joined environmental groups to push for the government to use the little boxes to track the miles you're traveling, and possibly the road you're driving, and then use the information to draft a tax bill.
The Tea Party is landing.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses concern about the protection of privacy.
And while members of Congress can't agree on whether to continue, several states have not waited.
They're looking at how, over the next decade, they can move to a system that allows drivers to pay based on the number of miles traveled.
Thousands of motorists have already boarded these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system, for an experimental ride.
This is really essential for our nation.
 It's not like we had a choice , said Hasan Ikhrata, general manager of the Southern California Association of Governments, which predicts that the state will start recording the miles traveled by every California driver by 2025.
There will be a change in the way we pay these taxes.
Technology is here to do that.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country's Highway Trust Fund, funded by taxes Americans pay on the pump, is financially dry.
Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars can travel more than a mile with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents a gallon, hasn't been raised in 20 years.
Politicians are reluctant to raise the tax even by a hundred, when gasoline prices are high.
 The gas tax is simply not sustainable , said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently installed tracking devices on 500 cars to test a mileage system.
 This turns out to be the most logical alternative in the long term , he said.
Wonks calls this mileage usage fee.
It is not surprising that the idea appeals to city liberals, since taxes could be used to change driving habits in order to reduce congestion and emissions, for example.
California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the goals set out in the state's ambitious climate change laws.
But Representative Bill Shuster (R-PA), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said he also considered it the most viable long-term alternative.
The free market supporters of the Reason Foundation also appreciate the idea of paying drivers per mile.
 This is not just a tax that is clogging itself in a big black hole , said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. Transportation Secretaries who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go the mile-pay path.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot last year that would have involved about 10,000 cars.
But the House presidency killed the proposal, responding to concerns from rural legislators representing voters who have to travel many miles every day to get to work or the city.
However, several states and major cities are making progress on their own.
The most determined is Oregon, which mobilized 5,000 drivers to conduct the nation's most important experiment.
These drivers will soon be paying the state for miles instead of gasoline taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is considering one.
Illinois is testing a limited number of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transportation in states along the U.S. East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida) is looking at how it could implement change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer drivers recently equipped their cars with a machine, drivers were concerned that the government could track their every move.
 Concerns about Big Brother and stuff like that are a big problem , said Alauddin Khan, who heads strategic performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It's not something people want.
From the beginning of the trial, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website:  It would be relatively easy to turn these devices into fully localized devices. 
There is no need to build a huge, overwhelming technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of people's daily comings and goings.
Nevada is one of the few states that is now struggling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many miles a car travels, but without knowing the exact place or time.
If we can do this, Khan added, the citizens will feel more comfortable.
The research into this technology has led some state agencies to call on a small California startup called True Mileage.
Originally, the company was not intended to help motorists who pay taxes to the states.
She was trying to break into the emerging auto insurance market, where drivers would pay based on their mileage.
But the devices she's testing have been liked by the big-axis planners because they don't use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically downloaded by modem.
 People will be more likely to do that if you don't record their speed and locate them , said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
Major errors have been made in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are far less expensive and less intrusive methods of doing so.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with offering motorists a variety of options.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They can still choose not to have a device at all, preferring instead to pay a fee based on the average number of miles traveled by all residents of the state.
Other states hope to sell the concept to suspicious citizens by allowing the machines to do more than not enough.
In New York City, transportation officials are looking to develop a taxation system that would also be equipped to pay parking fees, provide insurance  payment to driving  and create a real-time speed data set from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
 Motorists would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits the system offers them , said an urban planning document.
However, some transport planners wonder if the whole debate about mileage is not simply a huge diversion.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission of the San Francisco Bay Area, officials say Congress could very simply manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by raising gasoline taxes.
A single or additional annual tax could be levied on drivers of hybrid vehicles and others whose vehicles do not consume much petrol, so that everyone pays his fair share.
 There is no need for radical surgery when you simply need aspirin , said Randy Rentschler, the Commission's Director of Law and Public Affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about protecting their privacy and a lot of other things.
David Bowie: four new songs in the studio
The English musician hasn't finished surprising this year.
Starting with The Next Day, which came out in January, he devised a luxury reissue scheduled for November 4, with several new editions.
Four have already emerged on the Web.
The announcement of the release of a new David Bowie album had left everyone shocked.
On his 66th birthday, January 8, 2013, he announced that a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last record, Reality, dated 2003) and too few public appearances, the English musician proved that he could still be counted on to sparkle the pop scene.
A feast for his fans
Not too tired of surprises, David Bowie had more than one run in his bag with The Next Day.
Thin White Duke is scheduled to re-release this album on November 4.
On the occasion, he's been making a real party for his fans.
This reissue, titled The Next Day Extra, will be presented in three discs: the original album, unreleased studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four previously unveiled clips.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional tracks from the original album: the three Deluxe edition tracks, five songs specially unveiled for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie also made a video presentation of this beautiful box.
He introduces each of the records, but also the accessories that come with them: exclusive photos and covers, a booklet to share his own impressions, a booklet with lyrics...
And, most importantly, he's giving a taste of his new album Atomica, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with very advanced guitars and a skillfully mastered electric rock sound.
Newly Published News
But Atomica isn't the only title to reveal its charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available online.
The Informer is double-sided: a disturbing intro before a bright cavalcade slowing down to make way for a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a small reference to Elton John's Rocket Man, or even Gravity?
With this playful title, the singer seems to be in his element when he no longer has his feet on the ground.
Space Oddity, next door, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie once again refers to his strangeness: would he come from another planet?
The guitar riffs, charming, make you want to leave Earth.
Bowie's having fun playing chameleon with these titles:
He conceals and reveals at the same time, playing to adopt different personalities, as he has done throughout his career, notably with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
No wonder he has a mask on his hand in the Louis Vuitton's "Invitation to Travel" campaign, where he is the new face.
It will appear in one of their advertising spots, broadcast from November 10.
Defence Minister Rob Nicholson insisted that wounded soldiers were not summarily released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was followed by all soldiers before they returned to civilian life.
Attacked by the Liberals and New Democrats in the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson assured that before they were released, members of the military were following a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers are being properly treated for their return to civilian life and none of them are released until they are ready, he said.
Critics accuse the government of trying to save money by not allowing injured soldiers - who do not meet the army's "universal service" rule that requires personnel to be able to perform a range of tasks - to reach the 10-year eligibility period for retirement benefits.
They cited two cases reported by The Canadian Press, including one soldier released last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a London, Ontario, reservist with post-traumatic stress disorder, was discharged from the army despite his request to stay for one more year so he could receive a full indexed pension.
His case came after Corporal Glen Kirkland told a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed out before he was ready because he didn't meet the universal rule of service.
Mr. Hawkins stressed that a soldier could be prepared to leave, with plans and consultation sessions, but that was totally different from wanting to leave the ranks.
"I told them I wasn't ready", he said in an interview with The Canadian Press on Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was a way I could stay, and they said no.
Since the start of the major fighting in Afghanistan, the military has struggled to determine what latitude it can grant wounded soldiers who want to stay in the ranks but are not fit for battle.
Under current rules, soldiers who are seriously injured have up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for deployment abroad, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data presented to Parliament last year indicate that of the 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the age required for retirement benefits.
Liberal veteran spokesman Jim Karygiannis called for the reintegration of Corporal Hawkins on Wednesday, while New Democrat Jack Harris called for an immediate end to "this shameful practice".
Disney put on tablets to launch an animated series
The American media and entertainment group Disney has decided to give preference to tablets to its own TV channels for the upcoming release of a new children's series.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available from November 24 on watchdisneyjunior.com or through its mobile phone and tablet app.
Its worldwide launch on Disney Group channels is not expected until 2014, details the release of its Disney Junior division.
The cartoon, for children ages 2 to 7, tells the story of the cat Callie, a sheriff in a western U.S. town where she uses a magic lasso to bring order to the city.
Each episode has two 11-minute stories.
"Interacting with smartphones and tablets is second nature for children today", commented Albert Cheng, vice president of digital products at Disney/ABC Television Group, quoted in the statement.
This type of experience is part of Disney's efforts to "extend the lifespan of its series and build new relationships with its audience through increasingly important digital platforms", he added.
A survey published earlier this week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of children under the age of 2 already use a tablet or phone, and 72% of children under the age of 8, up from 10% and 38% two years ago.
Snowden is ready to cooperate with Germany on the issue of US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the US intelligence whistleblower, said he was willing to go to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers about their activities.
German lawmaker Hans-Christian Ströbele met with Mr. Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he is granted asylum, to discuss his witness in Germany.
In a letter the member sent to the media in Berlin on Friday, Mr Snowden said:  Although the result of my efforts has been clearly positive, my government continues to treat dissent as a leak and seeks to penalize political discourse with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself. 
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the US government to drop the criminal charges against him.
As part of the complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, he is accused of espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, the German Interior Minister, told Zeit Online:  If Mr Snowden is willing to speak to German officials, we will make sure that this is possible. 
Relations between the United States and Germany have been severely strained following complaints that the NSA tapped the cell phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the Member who heads the parliamentary group overseeing foreign intelligence services, said that if there was a chance to hear Mr Snowden as a witness  without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the United States , it should be taken advantage of.
Mr Ströbele, the German Green MP, posted a photo of himself with Mr Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr Ströbele said that according to the lawyer of the former NSA consultant, Mr Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would have to be assured that he would be safe there, the member said.
Mr Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been the subject of a serious and sustained campaign of persecution that forced him to leave his country.
However, he said he was encouraged by the global reaction to my act of political expression.
Citizens around the world and senior officials  including in the United States  felt that the revelation of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance was of public benefit.
The letter offers an offer of cooperation with the German authorities  when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved 
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers may well have access to apps like Facebook, Twitter and ultimately the Netflix on-demand video service via their TVs in the not-so-distant future.
The Cogeco branch said on Thursday that it was currently conducting preliminary tests of the beta version of the platform with some of its users.
"This will allow us to highlight more user-friendly interfaces and more options", Cogeco President and CEO Louis Audet said in an interview.
Cogeco Cable follows in the footsteps of its competitors, such as Bell, although the Cogeco branch has not yet set a precise date for this new platform.
"You have to adapt and change or resist change and fail", Mr Audet stressed.
The ultimate goal remains to provide tools that our customers do not currently have access to.
The telecom giant Rogers has already indicated that it could offer Netflix if certain technical details, which have not been mentioned, can be resolved.
In the United States, the popular video service says it is in talks with some major cable distributors to make its service available through their broadcast platforms.
The Cogeco and Cogeco cable Ombudsman also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper Government during its speech on the throne on 16 October.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite television providers to offer customers the possibility to pay for services by card.
"It has been about two and a half years since we said that the idea of forcing consumers to buy large chain packages doesn't work", Audet said.
He hopes, however, that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council (CRTC) will lead to interesting recommendations.
"A kind of new framework for defining our new Canadian cultural policy on television will have to emerge from these discussions", said Cogeco's chief investigator.
The CRTC has been holding public consultations since last week and they are expected to continue with the industry next spring.
On the results side, Cogeco reported a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82 cents per share.
This is a decrease from net profit of 44.9 million, or 83 cents per share, for the same period last year.
The Montreal-based company explains this decline by depreciation costs related to new acquisitions.
Cogeco acquired the US-based cable distributor Atlantic Broadband in 2012 for $1.36 billion.
This was the first major acquisition of the company after the failed acquisition in Portugal.
In December last year, the Montreal company also acquired Peer 1 Network Enterprises, a Vancouver-based Internet provider, for 526 million.
Cogeco's revenue grew by 41.5% in the fourth quarter to 504.7 million.
That is 1.8 billion for the current financial year.
Net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was 43.9 million, or 90 cents per share, down from 45.7 million, or 93 cents per share, in the same period last year.
However, Cogeco Cable's revenue increased by 45% to 470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers in the fourth quarter.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established a market economy investor protection scheme.
Mr Audet is not concerned about seeing the number of customers fluctuate like this.
For me, this is not an indication of a change in trend, he observed.
It varies from quarter to quarter with a very strong competition.
From horse to beef products
Horse meat was found in cans of beef products sold by two small British retailers at low prices, the Food Hygiene Agency said today.
Routine tests revealed that products, developed in January in Romania and sold by the Home Bargains and Quality Save chains, contained 1 to 5 percent of horse DNA.
"As horse meat is not mentioned in the ingredient list, it should not have been in the product", explained the British agency.
A scandal over the presence of horse meat in cooked dishes broke out in Europe earlier this year following tests in Ireland.
According to surveys by the European Commission, France was the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products believed to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles has injured four people on the road 131 in Lanaudière.
Shortly before 4 a.m., a driver driving north in Saint-Félix-de-Valois lost control of his vehicle and hit a car coming in the other direction.
All four occupants of both vehicles were injured, but they were not feared for their lives.
Traffic was back to normal by 6:00 a.m. on Friday.
Frontier Airlines plans to pay for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 to passengers carrying hand luggage on its flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for carry-on luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, although in its announcement on Wednesday, it indicated that passengers could take the unopened can with them at the plane's descent.
The new hand luggage charge applies to bags stored in the upper compartment, so small bags under the seat will always be free.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if the fees were paid in advance and $100 if travelers only paid once at the boarding gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 was intended to encourage travelers to pay the fees in advance.
 We do not want to pay that price , she explained.
Airlines began charging first and second baggage in 2008.
Passengers who tried to avoid these costs put as much as they could in the hand luggage that was stored in the upper compartments, so there was often no more room in those compartments.
These costs are a way to ensure that passengers carry less on board.
O'Malley said the new fees won't really be used to raise money.
It is about making the most loyal Frontier customers understand that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the upper compartments.
Passengers who purchase tickets from the airline's website will not have to pay.
For example, a passenger queuing at a border crossing gate could carry a bag for free, while the next person in the queue might have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's site and registration procedures are changing to ensure passengers are aware of the existence of these charges before they arrive at the gate.
The Frontier hand luggage charge will not apply until summer, although no date has been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage and other expenses, but airlines love them.
They believe that the costs of handling luggage are high and that passengers who want this service should pay for it.
Many people on Wall Street view the increased baggage charge as a sign that airlines are paying enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
But many of them did not touch the cost of luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. applied the first hand luggage charges three years ago, and the low-cost Allegiant followed a little later.
The only other company charging such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who is closely following the additional charges.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit's hand luggage costs were $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently traveled on Spirit and wondered what he would find at the boarding gate as passengers learned of the unusual hand luggage charges the airline had imposed.
 I had never seen such a smooth boarding procedure in my entire professional career , he said.
I expected to see grinding teeth and a fight breaking out at the door.
The plane was full, he added, passengers boarded at lightning speed.
Frontier also does like Spirit and charges $2 for a coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Frontier said passengers who take a soda or fruit juice can take the unopened can with them, and those who take coffee can be served free.
She'll always give out free water.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for drinks in 2008 but came back seven months later after passengers complained and when no other major airline had followed suit.
Frontier's decision to charge hand luggage fees when passengers do not purchase their tickets directly from the airline is its last attempt to encourage customers to visit its site.
Airlines pay online travel vendors like Orbitz $10 to $25 for every ticket sold.
This has prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them rather than going to an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, it began offering only half a mile of loyalty to customers who bought their tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she cut mileage premiums by 25% on a trip.
So a 1,000-mile Frontier trip bought from an online travel agency would make 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seats in advance only if they purchase their tickets directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal clientele in his hometown of Denver, but his business is falling and he's losing money.
Revenue fell 9 percent and its flight capacity declined by nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic tried to repair Frontier's finances by selling the airline.
NSA is calling in an internal error, not hackers for the failure of its website.
The National Security Agency working in the shadows said Friday that it was a bug that caused its public website to crash for a few hours, not hackers as some claimed online.
NSA.gov was inaccessible for a few hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a planned update, the spy agency said in an email statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations that the failure was due to a distributed denial of service (DSD) attack are false.
Earlier tonight, online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been down for at least six hours, and some users still can't access the site.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency's sensitive internal network was not compromised at all.
No classified information is in danger, the spokesman explained.
At least one group of online hackers claimed responsibility for breaking down the NSA website through a DSD attack.
DSD attacks are designed to flood a targeted site until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
Cyber tactics are not very sophisticated and attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the targeted system.
The formerly ultra-secret NSA, once known as the  No Such Agency , has come under fire and heavily criticised in recent months following a wave of revelations about its extensive communications surveillance programs at home and abroad  which are part of the NSA's secret files stolen from the agency and disclosed by former disillusioned NSA consultant Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy surrounding the agency has sparked much speculation that tonight's incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
Delta City Centre now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville Hotel closed its doors in Montreal on Thursday after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to developers who will turn it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Of these, 200 still have not found new jobs.
Delta promises not to let its employees down.
Employers came to meet employees directly on the spot, and employees were met individually to assess their needs.
"This support will continue for the next six months", explains Felix Bisson, Regional Director of Labour Relations at Delta Hotels.
The closure of Delta is part of a highly competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned that building had choices to make.
Either he was reinvesting in the building to keep it running, so there was tens of millions of investments whereas the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that have appeared in Montreal.
"Or he was selling it to someone else and that's what happened", explains Paul Arsenault, who holds the Transat Tourism Chair at UQAM's School of Management Sciences.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as the Crown Plaza which will become a retirement home.
Meanwhile, four hotel projects totaling nearly 600 rooms will be completed within two years.
For Titan CEO, "the Goodyear Amiens acquisition project starts with zero employees"
After throwing a sponge in January for the partial takeover of the Goodyear site in Amiens-Nord, which was promised to close, Maurice Taylor, CEO of the American tyre manufacturer Titan, today says he is ready to save 333 jobs out of the 1,137 that the plant has.
The Minister for Productive Development, Arnaud Montebourg, had already announced this on Monday 21 October.
After giving up the purchase plan for the plant in January, you're back today.
You have spoken of violent attacks and insults, of "so-called workers" who "work three hours" a day, of "crazy" unions, targeting the CGT.
We don't understand that turn around.
Is this to please Mr. Montebourg ?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except for my wife.
Mr. Montebourg, is a charming young man trying to save some of the highest-paid industrial jobs.
If I hurt anyone with my words, I'm sorry.
But France has a high level of taxation and unemployment too.
Does the truth hurt you?
Working seven hours a day, while in other countries you work eight hours, is a handicap for France.
In India, China and many other countries, people work ten to twelve hours a day.
But I have no prejudice against France.
What I see is a factory that makes good agricultural tires, has good equipment, is well located and has room to expand.
Why does Titan need this factory so much?
Titan doesn't need to buy this plant.
But with the right price and skilled workers, it's worth a try.
What kind of deal are you expecting between CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the closure of the plant was announced, Goodyear had offered employees a good severance package, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's say Titan buys the closed factory from Goodyear.
Titan could then move the machines to Poland or to any other European Union country that still has its own currency.
I think Mr. Montebourg knows that.
But he wants to keep Amiens' factory with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them from some 1,200 current Goodyear employees.
So Mr. Montebourg needs a Titan engagement before he tries to get the CGT to sit down at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is for CGT and Goodyear to agree on severance payments for all employees.
From then on, there will be no more employees in the factory.
Mr. Montebourg said you were prepared to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
Can you confirm that?
The only number I mentioned to the minister is 333.
I know he'd like a four-year warranty.
But as I told you, CGT and Goodyear must first agree on severance payments.
If all employees accept them, the factory purchase project starts with zero employees.
How can we guarantee the length of employment when there are no more employees on the site?
If Mr Montebourg can get the CGT and Goodyear to agree and Titan buys the plant, we plan to stay in Amiens-Nord for more than four years.
Bombardier's profit declined as aircraft deliveries and orders declined
Bombardier Inc, a Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer, reported a 15% drop in net profit on Thursday, under pressure from a drop in aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contractual problems in its Trains division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, has also not provided flight test data for its new CSeries aircraft or information on whether the aircraft will meet its ambitious commercial service schedule before September.
After the test aircraft's maiden flight about a month and a half ago, it flew only three times, and the question then arose as to whether the test phase was on track.
The results were not as forecast and the stock price fell by 8% on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at the National Bank Financial, lowered his rating on Thursday from  overperformance  to  sector performance  due to the low potential for the stock market to rise over the next quarter or two quarters.
 Although the drop in aircraft deliveries was largely anticipated, we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Transport division , said Cameron Doerksen in a note to customers.
We believe Bombardier will record new orders for its CSeries aircraft as the flight test program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family of aircraft will catapult it into the lower segment of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and took off for the first time in September after months of delay.
But the number of firm orders for CSeries aircraft is still modest at 177, and it appears that potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to validate the company's claims about the energy efficiency and savings potential of the new airliner.
At present, the company has registered a total of 403 orders and purchase commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, President and CEO, is confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 firm orders before the first aircraft is put into commercial service.
The leaders also reassured analysts and the media on Thursday that the programme was progressing on schedule.
 The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected , Mr Beaudoin said at a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned during the time the aircraft was down.
Every builder plans differently.
We decided to go on a first flight and set up an update period, and that's what we did.
This will be repeated throughout the flight program.
The second of the five test planes is expected to fly in the coming weeks, with the others to follow shortly after, the company said.
However, analysts are skeptical that the first customer could fly a CSeries aircraft only 12 months after its maiden flight.
Bombardier said it was evaluating the entry into service schedule and would provide further information in the coming months.
 This slow flight test  although apparently in line with Bombardier's internal schedule  reinforces our view that entry into service will be delayed to the first quarter of 2015 , said Mr. Doerksen.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, compared with $172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
The adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenue fell slightly from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected a return of 10 cents per share and revenues of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer said it delivered 45 aircraft in the quarter, up from 57 a year earlier.
Net orders have dropped to 26 aircraft, down from 83 before.
The delay in the Aerospace division was $32.9 billion on 30 September, unchanged from 31 December of the previous year.
 In Aeronautics, the results were as we had predicted, but the low number of orders and the general market conditions were disappointing , said Mr Beaudoin.
Airline revenue fell by 13% to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway company, said that its revenue had increased by nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The total order book of the Transport division was $32.6 billion on 30 September, a slight increase from 31 December of the previous year.
The margins of the Transport Division suffered from performance problems in relation to some large contracts.
Leaders announced that new guidance would be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's stock price, which also announced that Google Inc. chief financial officer Patrick Pichette would be on the board of directors, fell 8.5 percent to C$4.83 on Thursday afternoon.
Embraer SA, the Brazilian company, the world's third largest aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's closest competitor, reported a 10% fall in its quarterly profit on Thursday.
Two speleologists aged 23 and 27 were missing in a hole under the Croll's Tooth since Thursday night, the Isère Relief Speeo reported on Friday.
They were located this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one of whom was in the habit of practicing and the other not, had gone underground on Thursday at about 9.30pm to make a crossing of the Crolles Dent, located in the commune of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
We hadn't heard from them since then, the same source said.
"The speleologists should have come out around 5 a.m"., said Thierry Larribe, technical adviser at the relief agency.
Dozens of people on the scene
About 20 rescue workers, 10 French civilians, police, CRS and firefighters were on the scene.
Late this Friday afternoon, the two speleologists were located.
"It was another group of speleologists who, after finding them exhausted but healthy in the cavity, passed the information on to one of the rescue teams involved in the network", explains Le Dauphiné.
The two soldiers in the 13th Battalion of the Alpine Hunters of Chambéry were found "exhausted but unharmed".
They got lost in the net, went back on their feet while waiting for rescue, the prefecture said.
They should be fed and come out of the cave with the help of emergency services in the evening.
German journalists asked to flee Google and Yahoo
The German journalists' union on Thursday urged its members to stop using the online services of Google and Yahoo following new revelations about the activities of US and UK intelligence services.
"The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid using Google and Yahoo's search engines and messaging until further notice", she said in a statement.
It called the Washington Post's reports "scandalous", saying that the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the UK Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) had collected massive amounts of information by infiltrating international networks that allowed the two firms to synchronize their servers.
"The investigations of journalists are as confidential as the contact details of their sources and the nature of their communications with them", added Michael Konken, president of the union, which claims 38,000 members.
Repeated fires: MEPs call for Brigitte Grouwels' resignation
The project by Minister Brigitte Grouwels to 'relift' the signalling posts in Brussels is not pleasing to everyone.
The Brussels Minister for Public Works and Transport launched a test project in central Brussels on Thursday to repaint 16 Brussels yellow and blue signalling lights in the region.
The aim is to "increase security" and "Brussels identity".
The idea is to eventually repaint all the Brussels signalling lights, at an estimated cost of about one million euros.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark", according to Brussels MP Emmanuel De Bock, who speaks of "flaming" the capital and demands Brigitte Grouwels' "resignation".
"Not content with foolishly spending the money of the Brussels people on the re-lifting of the colourful signposts in the Brussels Region, Brigitte Grouwels continues her work on the Flemishisation of the Capital", de Bock said in a statement.
After her yellow-black-manger taxis, she finally repainted herself in dark-blue-yellow the Brussels poles.
According to the MEP, there is no longer a 'visual continuity difference between Flanders and Brussels'.
The people of Brussels deserve better than to see their money wasted by a CD&V minister who is herself implementing the NVA programme.
It's high time we stopped the Flemish Trojan.
'It is a reminder that Brigitte Grouwels was elected with only 2 245 votes, or 0.5% of the Brussels population!' concludes Mr De Bock.
the Pont-de-Buis portico dismantled
The Pont-de-Buis tax gate, which was surrounded by a violent demonstration by anti-tax protesters on Saturday, was dismantled on Thursday morning.
Cranes arrived shortly after 10 a.m., and traffic on the national highway was diverted in the aftermath.
The decision to dismantle the building, announced by Finistère prefecture on Wednesday, was taken by Ecomouv, the company managing the portico.
It is the last of the three eco-tax ports in operation in the Finistère department, the other two having been dismantled or sabotage.
Launch of a Google Glass accessory shop
An online store offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass has just been made available to thousands of developers with a Google-signed prototype of connected glasses.
They may buy a headset, a charger, or a storage case.
This store, which is strictly for developers who already have Google Glass, offers a few accessories such as a charger and USB cable for $50.
For the same price, you can also buy a microfibre protective cap or an intra-ear headset.
Although Google is currently working on a Google Glass model equipped with correction lenses, no date for large-scale marketing has yet been confirmed.
My father's been gone for five years.
At first I denied his death, I spoke of him now,
I was so afraid of forgetting it or rather I didn't know how I was going to keep "freaking" it.
There's no recipe, no way to get past the wall of the invisible and find your own.
Then there were signs.
The first time was the very strong feeling of his presence in the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time, a sweet man woke up in the middle of the night to look at his watch, which never leaves me, lying on the night table.
It's the image of my smiling father that accompanies me in my everyday actions.
Our mother left us after a tiring battle with cancer.
At least that's what I thought the day I found her empty body, crushed on that hospital bed with wrinkled sheets.
Likewise, his funeral was a cold farewell focused around the faint glow of the candles framing his coffin.
I thought she was gone.
Little by little, by small apparitions day or night, a little timid, a little erased, she quickly came back into my mind, evolving as she took her place again in the landscape of my thought that I thought was mourning.
And then she would reveal herself to me while revealing my own facets that I hadn't yet perceived, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had not lost my mother's person at all but simply a woman I didn't really know, a woman who embodied that person during her time in life.
By dying, this woman had perfected her life and released the person I loved, and here I was finding her, full and whole.
This detour from my life's path remains the most unexpected and beautiful.
It's a privilege to know that loved ones never leave us.
I look like my father, inside and out.
I've always been told that.
I never believed him back then.
I had a difficult relationship with him until he got old, sick.
I was no longer afraid of him and I could love him.
One day, he died.
He was my companion for a long time, when I quit smoking, when I was scared, when I was in pain.
He spoke to me, he encouraged me constantly, he lived in my body.
I could see his hands looking at mine, I could lend him my body.
But it was never indiscrete.
I could have a personal life.
He left me my privacy.
It was a long time ago, and then one day he left.
Finally, it was comforting and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, and counseled.
I don't know who said that dead people are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are gone, but I feel them around me all the time.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always refer to it: what would they have said? what would they have thought? what would they have done?
I keep dreaming of them, maybe not every night, but several times a week, that's for sure.
I often dream of the last moments I have to share with them before it's too late, only there's always something that's keeping me from fulfilling that moment.
I often wake up anxious when it happens to me and I feel deeply absent from them.
Sometimes some dreams lead me to the opposite and they get into my story and actually they continue to live and share my life.
The day before my ultrasound, when I was supposed to know the sex of my baby, I dreamed that I was waking up, getting out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the steps and he was smiling and cheering me on as I was waiting for a little boy.
The next day, I felt that he had visited me in my sleep to tell me that he was happy to share what was happening to me.
And of course, it was a little boy in my belly.
I enjoyed sharing that moment with him and I am happy to share that shared memory of his death.
Five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer.
A year earlier, she was on a trip with my family to Cuba.
I mean, the shock that her disappearance caused the young bachelor I was in at the time.
I nevertheless realized my grief pretty quickly.
But it continues to affect my life, especially when I have difficulty or when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and becoming interested in the Middle East, to the point of getting a master's degree in Arabic at a major university, were not, in hindsight, a trivial choice.
In fact, I often heard her speak Arabic as a child, and talk about Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she has instilled in me are always present, so I sometimes think about how she would want me to act at any given time.
I am trying to be as generous and upright as a former believer.
Now I feel her as a daily presence, a loving soul, a saving spirit.
I see her eyes fall on me.
My mother died nineteen years ago now.
Dead after you spoke to me on the phone.
I've been through all the stages: misunderstanding, anger, pain, self-inflicted tears, anywhere, anytime, in unusual places, at unusual times.
Then time calmed the pain.
All that was left was the lack, the unanswered emptiness, the need for her to confide in me, to reassure me in the depths of her sweetness.
Yet she's there, silent presence, she's there and she's looking at me.
Every morning I see his anxious eyes fall upon me, I see the dark circles that weigh his gaze, the grooves around the lips that cigarettes dig, the wrinkles that mark the forehead in the days of anxiety.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me in my mirror every morning.
And every morning, I turn my eyes away.
My wife and the mother of my three children died of cancer at the age of 43.
We can always feel his protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his pain bed, so we gradually learned to smile, and pronouncing his name is no longer taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I talk to her in the middle of the night when the absence hurts too much, she invites me into my dreams when the mood is a little bit reached.
We feel supported and protected in difficult times, the passage of time makes us realize how much she was a conductor and we try to stay on track as she set us.
If someone has loved you so much, the absence can't take him out of your heart and memory.
In a way, the one you love becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008, to asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, and I always acted on what he thought or liked.
I couldn't attend her funeral and three weeks after she died, I was giving birth to a baby boy.
Even if my beliefs are sometimes different from his, I still wonder if my actions are in line with his view of things.
I've had some problems in my work with these beliefs.
I can't go the other way, I don't sleep, and I always wonder what he'll think.
I don't know if I've adopted his way of being or if I'm just like him: is it genetic?
Either way, he'll always be my reference.
It was kind of like an alter ego, there was no need to talk between us.
In short, he's here every day.
I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
It has been almost thirty years since my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 and our son was 6.
The great pain that then overwhelmed me has, of course, eased, but he is still close to me.
Very often it "landed" in my dreams in such a precise, so vivid way that when I woke up I was even more sad to find that it was just a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was okay, and I said no, and he said, "I'm coming down", but with a voice so real that I woke up in a rush, anxious, and I lit the headlight looking everywhere, convinced it was coming.
I still live in the same house, and often I feel watched and I turn around to see if he's not there, I know it's him and I talk to him.
Every room I go to feels his presence and that makes me happy.
For nothing in the world would I leave this house where we were happy and where her spirit lives with me.
I'm 58 years old, I've lived alone ever since he left, he's and will always be the love of my life.
I want to make it clear that I'm social with a responsible profession, I laugh and sing, I go out, I'm a grandmother, I have a lot of friends, but my heart and soul belong to him and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October has been the bloodiest month since 2008
October was Iraq's deadliest month since April 2008.
Baghdad released official figures on Friday: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 police and 44 soldiers.
This publication is being made on the day the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the US President.
Noury al-Maliki wants help from the United States.
"We don't tell the world to stand by us and support each other, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it", al-Maliki said in Washington on Thursday.
And also because if what's happening in Iraq is not resolved, it's going to spread, and what's happening in Syria is going to spread, too.
And what happens when a virus of terrorism survives? It spreads.
Noury al-Maliki was speaking at the United States Institute for Peace, an independent institution set up by Congress.
Outside the building, protesters were protesting against the Iraqi leader.
They were holding up signs accusing him of being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide him with assistance.
The cocaine-addicted lawyer who informed a drug lord of a police investigation was arrested
Basharat Ditta, 42, was giving information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction would be exposed.
He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment by the Liverpool Court of Appeal
A senior defense attorney who informed a drug lord of a major police investigation because he feared his secret drug addiction would be exposed was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, was providing sensitive information to crime boss Neil Scarbrough about investigations into his drug trafficking activities after he compromised himself because of his cocaine habit.
The lawyer, who was nicknamed  Bash  and considered by criminals to be a  top-notch case , was arrested at his home in 2011 following police surveillance operations directed at Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous drug trafficking trial.
Police officers spotted Sarborough, 32, dropping three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, as he was attending a Barreau dinner with fellow lawyers.
Investigations revealed that Ditta was a regular user of this class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in her hair, wallet and credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he sought to obtain information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were being followed by police at the time as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in the counties of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They were later jailed along with 32 other men after police seized heroin and cocaine for £1.5m, plus more than £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42, was providing information to criminals because he feared that his drug addiction would be exposed.
Today, in the Liverpool Court of Appeal, Ditta, who works for the Blackburn-based law firm Forbes Solicitors, fell into disgrace after being found guilty of two counts of obstruction of justice after a three-week trial.
He admitted to possession of cocaine at a previous hearing.
The lawyer's fall came after police, investigating Scarborough, discovered he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and spotted him coming to Ditta's home and putting 60 percent pure drug under the lawyer's trash in a black golf glove.
Shortly after the deposit, Scarborough was in regular telephone contact with Ditta who was at a dinner at the football stadium at Ewood Park, home of Blackburn Rovers.
The lawyer went home, found the drugs, and they called nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a regular cocaine user after tests showed traces of this class A drug in her hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested but denied using cocaine, said he had spoken to the suspected drug dealer because he was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to a legal privilege.
During his arrest, Ditta collected his wallet and tried to withdraw several credit cards, but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken from him.
During an interview, he said that he had an office at his home and workplace and that clients would call him at home for legal matters.
But the court heard testimony that he was calling on major drug traffickers, including some he represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators knew.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said:  If anyone should know that they should not break the law, they should be a criminal lawyer. 
Mr Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer and of over-engaging with private clients.
The relationship we're talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the ordinary boundaries of a lawyer-client relationship.
He has obstructed the police investigation as much as he can to allow him to continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta didn't honor his profession, but he dishonored it.
He's been getting too close to some clients, especially Scarborough, and he's been compromising his independence.
Ditta denied any illegal activity and said:  If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately. 
But after the hearing, Lancashire Police Superintendent Lee Halstead said:  Mr Ditta went from a criminal lawyer to a criminal himself as he started procuring drugs from criminal organizations. 
His cocaine addiction compromised him forever and made him vulnerable to the backstory of the leaders of organized crime groups who had commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers should respect the strictest rules of integrity and create a climate of public trust.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the veneer of his profession.
The Lancashire Unit for Serious Organised Crime has been investigating Mr Ditta, who was found guilty of three counts of cocaine possession and now of obstruction of justice, testifying to his commitment to prosecuting the criminals.
You should use this as a warning to criminals so that they know that no one is above the law.
We'll find you and take you to court.
Scarborough himself was jailed for 14 years after pleading guilty to complicity in trafficking heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Another 35 people involved in the trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his website, Ditta hosted a question-and-answer session about himself in which he said that his dream job would be to be a lawyer representing clients on death row in America, his last dinner guest would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would be what would motivate him to work.
Aretha Franklin is back on stage in December.
The Detroit News reports that the Queen of Soul will perform on December 21 at the Sound Board Room of the MotorCity Casino.
Mrs. Franklin is scheduled to record an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music in November, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without specifying the disease she was suffering from, the famous Respect interpreter told the media on October 16 that the side effects of a treatment she was receiving were "difficult".
She says she's "happy to be back".
Menton reduces the cost of Christmas lights
420 motifs, 2.2 kilometres of coastline covered with a mantle of light: one could scrub the heat stroke in Menton with the bill of lights.
The fact that, unlike many municipalities, is also paid by taxpayers, not by merchant associations.
To alleviate costs, the city uses LEDs.
But also a differentiated management of the public lighting network and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles airport evacuated after a shooting
There was a shooting at Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10:00 a.m. local time when a man opened fire.
Local police say at least two people were injured.
It was an employee of the U.S. Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) and the shooter.
The incident was reported to have occurred at Terminal 3, causing a panic wave.
The passengers and crew rushed out to the exits or onto the tarmac.
Soon the police intervened and a man suspected of being the shooter was arrested on the roof of a parking lot at the airport.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is halted.
Classical music for teenagers
Each time, the school's customers will be targeted, an initiative that had been very successful in the previous season.
Five science fiction vignettes, designed and performed by local artists, with a high dose of humor, allow teenagers to master classical singing.
In addition to the show, the Royal Society of Lyrical Art will return with its Lyric Destinations, a formula that now fills the Chicoutimi Pulp Mill.
Two more concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, giving local artists a chance to show what they are capable of.
In addition to these activities, the Lyric Opera was a benefit concert held last August with the participation of the soprano Marie-Ève Munger.
It was a for-profit activity, alongside the artistic dimension, and it helped the nonprofit to produce a financial balance sheet that is as sweet to the ears as a bat's air.
Without giving specific figures, the chairman of the board, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press conference held in Chicoutimi yesterday to show his reassurance.
Despite the precarious situation of so many cultural institutions, the future is bright, even in the long run.
We have stronger and more consistent supports.
"Finances are floating and we hope to last until the 50th anniversary of the opera, a milestone we will reach in seven years", the administrator commented.
"I would say even beyond", added CEO Helen Gaudreault, smiling.
The 37-year-old man who took a child hostage at Gabrielle Roy School in Surrey is facing six charges, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Omar Moustapha Hassan was charged with kidnapping, seizure, threatening, carrying a weapon with dangerous intent, kidnapping, and failing to comply with an order.
"The rapid response of the police involved and their ability to defuse the situation immediately were essential to the safe conclusion of this incident", said Corporal Bert Paquet in a statement.
Omar Hassan is still in custody and will appear in court on Friday.
New class action against the Brothers of the Holy Cross
A new class action lawsuit was filed against the Holy Cross brothers over alleged sexual assaults this time at the St. Joseph's oratory and in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The request is based on the testimony of the applicant, identified as 'J. J.' who was allegedly masturbated in the 1950s, first at Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher Brother Soumis and then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at the St. Joseph's Oratory, where he served as a mass worshiper and where his father worked as a painter.
The first appeal was only against three institutions, and when the regulations were announced, many people said to us: "I, I was in such a place, can I register?" says Alain Arsenault, a lawyer who defends victims in both cases.
The special feature of the new class action is that it allows for the addition of complainants from any institution where abuse could have been committed by members of the Congregation of the Holy Cross.
The appeal now includes the complaints of 25 individuals who claim to have been assaulted by the Holy Cross.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, since many of the institutions concerned closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal also notes that the Congregation of the Holy Cross and the St. Joseph's Oratory, a separate entity, "have allowed sexual abuse of children", that they "have imposed a moral, religious and psychological strain on victims", that they "knew about and yet stifled sexual abuse", and that they "knowingly and consciously chose to ignore the issue".
These latest accusations are based, among other things, on letters written by the Holy Cross brothers' lawyer, Mr. Emile Perrin, in the 1990's, but also on archival research on the matter by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former Holy Cross brother who publicly denounced the abuse.
The collective action must first go through the qualification stage in the High Court.
Once the Court has accepted the admissibility, the second stage is followed, namely the substantive hearings.
In the first appeal, the Congregation of the Holy Cross agreed to settle the matter amicably before the full hearing was held.
A major fire in a commercial building
A fire severely damaged a business in the LaSalle district of Montreal on Thursday night.
Rescue was called in at around 1 a.m. on Friday, due to a fire that broke out in the basement of an Indian restaurant on Dollard Avenue near the intersection with Réjane Street.
The 30 firefighters who were sent to the scene took about an hour to contain the fire.
The fire "caused significant damage to the structure of the building", said Montreal Fire Safety Chief Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when the firefighters arrived on the scene.
No injuries were reported, but about 20 homes on the first and second floors of the commercial row had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross was requested because residents of one of the apartments may have to be temporarily accommodated, the SIM said.
There's a lot of opposition to medical help dying at the Congress of Palliative Care.
The Canadian Congress of Palliative Care, which is taking place this week in Ottawa, comes a few days after the vote in favour of the Quebec medical aid bill.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all patients had access to effective care to alleviate their suffering, in addition to being able to stay home, very few of them would want to end their lives, says Maryse Bouvette, a spokeswoman for the Canadian Association for Palliative Care.
If we focused on palliative care in Canada, the approach to euthanasia would be minimal.
The president of the Quebec Palliative Care Network also rejects the bill on medical assistance to die.
If it is adopted, Alberte Déry is concerned about the consequences for future generations.
"What is the meaning of life?" she regrets.
Most palliative care homes will refuse to help patients die, according to the Alliance of Palliative Care Homes Vice President Suzanne Fitzback.
Mrs Fitzback, also director of the Mathieu-Froment-Savoie home in Gatineau, considers the service to be useless anyway.
We never get asked, "I want to die, give me a shot".
Rick Firth, director of the Ontario Association for Palliative Care, believes that Quebec's bill is confusing the population about the profession of palliative care.
He doesn't think Ontario will follow suit.
The Liberal Member for Gatineau, Stéphanie Vallée, said the notion of the end of life would need to be clarified before the bill was passed.
Kenya's press outraged by controversial media law
 It is a scary country and it is legitimate to ask the following question: what will prevent Parliament from sweeping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow? , the newspaper said, challenging the bill and demanding it be declared unconstitutional.
 This law is draconian and very punitive, and we refuse it , said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group  owner of CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent news stations and websites in Kenya.
He said the new media court  will still be biased because it is an extension of the government  and that restrictions on content and advertising would harm Kenya's place in the global economy.
I hope that the President will listen to us and we ask him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament.
According to The Star, the new bill will give the government  control over the media  The Standard, meanwhile, said that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya  had suffered a hard blow  and punished the bill as  draconian .
The bill was passed alongside a series of measures to strengthen national security following the attack by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping centre last September.
The Kenyan media have angered the authorities by releasing surveillance video footage of troops deployed at the scene of the attack allegedly robbing the luxury mall.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by summoning two journalists and a media official to interview them, although the summons was withdrawn following a media outcry.
Under the new bill, media can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the added risk of being fired or unable to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize the property of an offender if he has not paid his fine.
According to the Daily Nation, even a single fine is enough to paralyze most FM stations.
He also says the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya's vibrant blogosphere.
By silencing the media, politicians know they can do whatever they want with impunity.
 No one will ever know , Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at The Nation, wrote, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
If the politicians were to be turned over to themselves, they would bankrupt the country and lead us back to hunting and gathering.
Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May they took a stand against the cuts ordered by the National Commission for Wages and restored their steeply rolling tax-exempt wages of around 532,000 shillings a month, which are among the highest in the world.
A difficult year for pharmacists
The departure of almost 10 pharmacists from the Centre de Santé et Services Sociaux (CSSS) in Laval caused a great stir in the management of the Cité-de-la-Santé Hospital during the year 2012-13.
The pharmacy department was severely understaffed due to numerous retirement, maternity leave and short-term departures.
It lacked nearly 30% of the required staff, making this financial year "very difficult", according to department head Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS has decided not to employ self-employed workers, which can cost up to three times more than a full-time pharmacist.
The problem solving procedure was not used, Mrs Beaudet explained.
We've streamlined or reduced some of our activities inside the facility to keep things going.
We certainly worked hard to get our young people [residents at the pharmacy] to come and stay here.
There's a race of circumstances that made us in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this difficult period, the year 2013-2014 is expected to be much easier for the pharmacy department of CSSS.
Already, three pharmacists are returning to work after maternity leave and three more pharmacists have been hired in recent months.
In addition, the department's efforts to retain the school have paid off, as the four students currently residing in Laval have also decided to remain employed by CSSS.
Now it's much better, the pharmacist pointed out.
By the end of the fiscal year, we'll have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
So this will fill our gaps from last year.
Growing Needs
The situation is still delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of pharmacists in hospitals or the predominance of young women in the profession, make situations like the one experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of staff] is always precarious, because we have a younger workforce and we employ a lot of young women, so with pregnancy, we almost always take three maternity leave when it's okay, she added.
Last year, we had a lot more and we didn't have any pharmacists available to replace, so it was harder.
The 22-year-old top model doesn't start his film career through the small door.
Director Lars von Trier chose her to play Charlotte Gainsbourg Young in Nymphomaniac, his next film.
This eight-part, two-part drama (January 1 and 8, 2014) depicts erotic memories of a four-year-old girl who became addicted to sex when she was a teenager.
Stacy Martin's resemblance to her older sister is striking: a toasty figure, a diaphany complexion and French-English origins.
Not to mention a certain taste for the risk: the one who did not hesitate to lay naked on ice sheet will be shown in much more sulfuric situations on the big screen.
An excerpt from Nymphomaniac has raised the temperature on the Web: Stacy Martin appears in bed and ecstatic with Shia LaBeouf.

A room at Narbonne's CGR evacuated Thursday night
On Thursday evening, the first screening of a film was interrupted at the CGR in Narbonne, as a precaution, following the throat tickling felt by viewers.
The director of the facility immediately ordered the room to be evacuated and alerted the firefighters to a suspicious smell.
About 70 people left the session.
The people were examined and a full room review gave no results.
A bad joke on the back of a tear gas jet?
Or accidental ?
The film industry has always played the principle of caution and the safety of its customers.
The room was aired and everything was back to normal.
The cinema was able to regain its rights and customers were able to enjoy the images again.

She's trying to import two kilos of cocaine into pumpkins.
Taking advantage of Halloween Day, a woman tried to smuggle two kilos of cocaine into the country hidden in pumpkins Thursday morning at Montreal Trudeau Airport.
It was during the examination of the passenger's luggage that the drug was detected.
The cocaine was distributed in three pumpkins that had previously been emptied.
The drugs were then transported to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) office which took over the investigation.
The Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) did not disclose where the woman was from when she was intercepted.
This is part of the investigation, said Jacqueline Roby, spokeswoman for the CBSA.
All I can tell you is that she was coming to the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border agents at Montreal Trudeau airport have made 173 seizures of drugs, including 10 seizures of cocaine for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, Quebec border agents seized a total of 1,653 drugs.
Air raid on military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli planes entered Lebanese airspace early Wednesday afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A cargo of short-range SA-8 surface-to-air missiles was reportedly targeted and destroyed.
The new IDF airstrike on Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed by Israel or Syria.
The raid was carried out under roughly the same circumstances as the one on July 5th: at the time, it was also an anonymous US official who confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, this time targeting Yakhont surface-to-sea missiles delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials had not hidden their anger at Washington's revelation of the attack, risking forcing President Assad to react.
Ukraine is nearing bankruptcy
The rating agency Standard & Poor's lowered Ukraine's credit rating on Friday, casting doubt on the former Soviet republic's ability to meet its financial obligations, which had been in recession for more than a year.
The country's public debt rating goes to "B-", falling into the speculative investment category.
It comes with a negative outlook, with S&P seeing at least one in three chances of it being lowered again within a year.
"It is less and less likely that the government's strategy will ensure sufficient foreign exchange to meet its high external financing needs", says the U.S. agency.
The Agency notes that Ukraine's foreign exchange reserves declined by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and expects the trend to continue.
This makes it difficult to repay loans taken abroad.
These reserves, which are heavily used by the authorities to support the local currency, the hryvnia, are collapsing, and the agency believes that devaluation is increasingly likely, which would inflate its external debt.
Kiev also needs cash to pay for its gas imports to Russia, which accuses it of not paying a $882 million bill.
This announcement is bad news for the Ukrainian authorities at a time of heightened tensions with their Russian neighbour, angry at Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public the day after official statistics showed that the country's economy had contracted in the fifth consecutive quarter between July and September.
Its debt, still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years and S&P estimates it at 33.5% of GDP, down from less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, which has a budget deficit, has been seeking help from the International Monetary Fund for months, which had granted it a loan of $15.3 billion in 2010 and has so far only unlocked $3.4 billion.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new installments until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, including increasing gas prices to the population.
After a new unsuccessful mission in the country, the IMF found this week that "the high external financing needs" were "vulnerable" while showing "signs of economic improvement".
However, according to economist Oleksandr Joloud of the Centre for Policy Studies, "a short-term improvement cannot be expected".
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year", said the expert, who was interviewed by AFP.
The only hope is an improvement in the international situation.
S&P also notes the "uncertainty" surrounding the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels has made conditional on the release of opposition leader Yulia Timochenko.
"Signing the deal would be positive for long-term trade but there could be negative short- and medium-term consequences related to Russia's reaction", explained S&P, which fears "trade restrictions" from Moscow.
Russia, which accounts for a quarter of Ukrainian exports, warned that if a free trade area between the EU and Kiev is established, it should strengthen its border controls for imported goods.
The United States is in the process of merging Publicis-Omnicom
Publicis and Omnicom said on Friday they had received no objection from US authorities to the merger, approaching the creation of the world's first advertising agency.
The merger brings the second global agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis, closer together.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Groupe today announced the expiry of the review period for the previously announced merger of Publicis Groupe and Omnicom, provided for by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended", the two groups announced in a statement.
They also said that they had received the necessary permits in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the review period foreseen by the HSR in the United States and authorisation decisions issued in the other courts fulfil several of the conditions necessary for the operation.
"The merger is also subject to obtaining further regulatory authorizations and approval by the shareholders of both groups", they add.
Congolese army chases M23 rebels
The Congolese Army (FARDC) announced Thursday that its units would chase the M23 rebels to their bases in the forests and mountains of northern Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears to be on the verge of defeat after being driven from the north-eastern parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) which it has controlled since the beginning of the insurgency 20 months ago.
"We will prosecute the M23 and accuse it wherever it hides because it is criminals", FARDC spokesman Colonel Olivier Hamuli told Reuters.
We must not let them reorganize themselves because they have been torturing the Congolese people for too long.
It's time to restore peace.
M23 officials said they had evacuated the towns under diplomatic pressure and political leader Bertrand Bissimwa told RFI that these military setbacks would not alter his demands for peace talks.
The latter, according to Ugandan mediators, resumed on Wednesday in Kampala between the Kinshasa government and the M23.
There are reports of hanging in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last town to fall to insurgents this week, as well as around Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion began in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, taking advantage of the government garrison's escape and the passivity of the Monusco blue helmets.
The fall of Goma led the UN Mission in the DRC, the world's largest in terms of personnel, to strengthen its mandate and form a rapid response brigade composed of South African, Malawian and Tanzanian soldiers.
For its part, the FARDC staff was reorganized and the army moved to the offensive against the M23, changing the course of the war.
The pace of government troops' advancement is unprecedented today.
"The M23 seems to be coming to an end", predicts Congolese business expert Jason Stearns on his Congo Siasa blog.
It would be historic - the first time the Kinshasa government has managed to defeat a major insurgency.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group allied with Rwanda would be present in eastern DRC.
UN experts accuse Rwanda, which vehemently denies it, of supporting the M23 military, which was formed from Congolese mutineers.
The head of British diplomacy, William Hague, has urged Rwandan President Paul Kagame to exercise restraint, a Foreign Office spokesman said.
Last week, Kigali had raised the possibility of military retaliation following shells dropped on Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, Bunagana residents raided the streets of the village to greet the entrance of FARDC soldiers.
"We lived with the M23 for a year and it seemed unimaginable that we would one day be liberated by the army", says a resident of this neighboring village in Uganda.
"We have lived in terror (of the M23) and are traumatized", he added.
The Pasteur Institute's tests on a suspected coronavirus patient have been negative, the health ministry said.
It states that 'the two cases identified in May 2013 remain the only two confirmed cases in France to date'.
On Tuesday, the 43-year-old suspect was believed to have contracted the disease after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already killed about 50 people.
Chevron, the second largest US oil company, reported a fall in its quarterly profit on Friday due to its falling refining margins, while its oil and gas production increased while still falling behind the group's targets.
Its third quarter net profit decreased to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per share, from $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters were estimating an average profit per share of $2.71.
The Group produced 2,59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, up from 2,52 million bpd a year earlier.
The company aims for 2.65 million bpd this year, with a 25% growth in production expected by 2017.
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
As a result of the cost of these projects, annual investment expenditure has increased by seven billion dollars in two years and is expected to reach 36.7 billion dollars in 2013.
Profit from production activities declined slightly in the third quarter, while profits from downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell by 45% to $380 million.
This decrease in refining margins affects the whole sector.
For example, Chevron's main competitor, Exxon Mobil, reported a net profit decline on Thursday despite its increased gas and oil production.
School transport: the complaint is deemed admissible
The Sherbrooke Region School Board (CSRS) has been requiring a fee of $150 per pupil (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for pupils using two-residence school transport since the beginning of the school year, a service the organisation provides when it is able to do so.
Before the last budgetary changes, no financial contribution was requested.
"There is a mediation service offered by the committee and I was interested", explains Ms. Lefèvre.
According to her, the CSRS was invited to mediate and asked for additional time to consider it.
"It is always better to talk about it, to consult and to find solutions", says Ms. Lefèvre.
The Sherbrooke Region School Board (CSRS) declined to comment.
The organisation only indicated that mediation is part of the process in a complaint.
Imbroglio around the closure of the emergency room at the Hotel-Dieu
In the face of the months-long crackdown by some staff and several unions, including the CGT, the Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, decided on 10 July to "defer the timetable for the implementation of the project, and in particular the closure date of the emergency services which cannot be reached until 4 November".
A request formally made "to avoid any risk on the management of the emergency in Paris at the beginning of winter" but also aimed at not disturbing the PS campaign a few months from the municipalities.
Despite the ministerial directives, the closure should still be effective on that date.
Although the term 'transformation' or 'continuous change' is preferred in the HPAA.
From 4 November onwards, firefighters - who provided about a quarter of the 40,000 annual passages to the emergency rooms at the Hôtel-Dieu - will all be instructed to take 30 serious cases a day to the emergency rooms of other Parisian hospitals.
This date of 4 November also corresponds to the renewal of the boarding schools.
At the Hotel-Dieu, the emergency internists will leave room for five general medicine internists on Monday.
As for the transfer of the internal medicine beds, it is scheduled for the month.
"The emergency department at the Hotel-Dieu must close as soon as possible, and for us it is November 4", assures Loïc Capron, chairman of the APHP Medical Institutions Committee (MEC), who supports the management's project.
"On November 4th, there will be no more patients brought by firefighters, only people coming by their own means", confirms Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical director of the new Hotel-Dieu.
"But we will continue to receive patients in emergency", he said, arguing that SMUR vehicles were always on site to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency doctors will remain on the scene, he added.
But it's up to the ARS to decide whether to shut down the emergency room.
"Things are happening gradually", says Nicolas Péju, spokesman for the ARS, who says that on November 4 there will be no change in service".
"The minister lied to us or was lied to", lamented emergency physician Gerald Kierzek.
He was removed from his post as head of SMUR in early July for leading the crackdown on the reorganisation project, and he described himself as a "warning-lender" in the face of a "cynical" decision by "the medical-administrative technostructure".
"They are draining and suffocating emergency rooms that were renovated less than five years ago", he says.
He said that "if the other Parisian emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem".
But they're always full.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours of waiting in the emergency room in Lariboisière.
The ARS argues that 30 patients 'dispatched' to several sites are not likely to represent an 'avalanche' in other emergency services, whose human resources have also been strengthened.
Both the ARS and the APHP are advocating the "new hospital model" already in place since 7 October and which is expected to continue to receive 30,000-35,000 patients a year.
By the end of the year, liberal general practitioners are also expected to be involved in the establishment of a "permanent outpatient care".
"Where do we go when people are asked to self-diagnose", asks Gerald Kierzek, who considers "the concept of a minor emergency" to be "dangerous" and marks a "medical regression".
It's gonna be like a level 3 maternity ward.
People aren't crazy, they're going to the best care available.
If the minister does not act by Monday, we will change the bracket, warns Christophe Prudhomme, emergency physician and member of the CGT Health.
We will be even more present in the municipal campaign and we will consider presenting a list.
In the team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, Councillor of UMP Paris and elected from the 4th arrondissement, makes it clear that "even if the Paris UMP was for the maintenance of emergency situations at the Hôtel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we return to responsibilities".
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, recalled on Monday morning on France Inter that she had spoken in favour of a moratorium on the closure on 4 November.
If this were the case, she would be clearly disagreeing, says Bruno Julliard, her spokesman.
Although the restructuring of the Hotel-Dieu is legitimate in its essence, we cannot accept it without an acceptable plan for transferring it to other hospitals.
Obama ends the IMF and World Bank wiretaps
Barack Obama ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to stop listening to the International Monetary Fund and World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, a US official said Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House's attempt to get back on the NSA's wiretapping case after the revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
This is the first time that the IMF and World Bank have been monitored by the intelligence agency since the scandal began.
When asked about the matter, a U.S. administration official replied: "The United States does not conduct electronic surveillance of the World Bank and IMF headquarters in Washington".
The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, did not specify whether such surveillance had been in place in the past.
Another official said that Barack Obama had ordered the practice to stop in recent weeks.
This instruction was given at about the same time as the hearing at the UN headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Intelligence Committee approved on Thursday a strengthening of controls on government surveillance programmes but authorized their continuation.
The Commission has introduced new restrictions on the data that intelligence agencies are authorized to collect and has imposed a five-year limit on the retention of that information.
UN welcomes new goals for poverty eradication
The United Nations will now begin work on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were set up 12 years ago to combat global poverty.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in highlighting the  Sustainable Development Goals  to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, ahead of the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development which began the day before in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it was time to move beyond national interests.
 I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and adopt the process for setting the Universal Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) , he added.
These SDGs will build on progress made under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States to implement our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which is based on the success of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing as conflicts between powerful figures
At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, Mozambique's founding president, shaving it, thousands gathered in the center of Maputo to chant peaceful slogans during a rare public demonstration.
 We want peace back; we want stability , said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of an investment firm.
Worried about the future of her country, she traded her work clothes for a shirt that read "We want security" in Portuguese before joining the crowd gathered in the capital's Independence Square on Thursday.
For two weeks, there have been reports almost daily of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, the worst clashes since the peace agreement signed more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, supported initially by white-ruled Rhodesia and then by South Africa's apartheid government as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After a peace agreement was signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country should not fall back into open conflict, but recent events have shocked foreign investors and local residents.
The challenge is considerable for the growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion in investment in the coming years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Brazil's Vale, Italy's Eni and the US's Anadarko.
Frelimo, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and Renamo have mutually rejected responsibility for the tensions.
Renamo says the government is behind the recent clashes and that it launched an attack on its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of Renamo, on October 17.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill the group's leader Afonso Dhlakama and Renamo spokesman Fernando Mazanga, according to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the conflict, accusing it of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza sought to minimize concerns about instability.
Mr. Guebuza told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama considered himself a  loser  who wanted to use  all the strength he had left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government .
The Frelimo and the Renamo insist that they both wish to avoid war.
But concern grew after Mr. Mazanga declared that Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that the agreement was no longer being respected by Frelimo.
 We want to resume negotiations, but with the utmost seriousness, Mr Mazanga said.
Previous discussions between the parties have failed to calm tensions fueled by a series of conflicts this year.
 These are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who keep arguing , explained Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the open university and a specialist in Mozambique.
None of them are good negotiators, and none of them are willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which supports electoral reforms, had already said it would boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted his use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to obtain concessions and a treasure trove of war from the government.
Renamo's share of the vote has been falling steadily since 1992, while a new party, the Mozambique Democratic Movement (MDM), which was founded by a former Renamo member, is expected to get more votes in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza who is due to retire at the end of his second term next year wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
 He does not want a multiparty democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency , said Mr Mazanga.
It's not clear exactly what Renamo's capabilities are, but it has conducted disruptive lightning strikes on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south highway.
Most of the strikes took place in the province of Sofala, which is located several hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port from which coal mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio was unable to use the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was falsely shy when asked if Renamo would repeat the threat.
Renamo wanted to warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique, Mazanga said.
The instability has increased the frustrations of the government, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, with many also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of kidnappings.
 People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country, and that it is up to the latter to find solutions to the problems , he explained.
Omar Sultuane, a protester, said the people only wanted stability.
 Nobody cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want to find peace, they want to have free access to the roads , he added.
Children should be taught myths and legends as lifestyle models, says the author.
The legend of Thor might show that  brutal force does not weigh against subtle cunning , while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be too violent, too scandalous and in some cases too obscene to be taught in school, Crossley-Holland advocated a careful selection of age-appropriate works.
 I find it remarkable that in America, myths and folklore are already part of education , he said.
I've been advocating for this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that authors and teachers are  openly didactic  makes children  completely unwitting , with messages being  sublimated  into pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said:  You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight. 
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or end well, but there is an innate sense of right and wrong.
And it must be sublimated; revealed through a story rather than declared.
The known basis of what you show and what you don't say.
One fighter from the Hamas armed wing was killed tonight and another wounded by Israeli tank fire in the Gaza Strip, according to medical and security sources in Gaza.
According to these sources, these activists were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian Territory and Israel when they were hit by an Israeli armoured cartridge.
NSA spying: US "goes too far", Kerry admits
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" in spying, Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged, in Washington's first confession in a contentious debate with Europe about the massive data collection by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the United States and its European allies, this is the first time a US government official has explicitly admitted controversial practices in the NSA's interception of communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, I admit to you, as the President has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we will make sure that this does not happen again in the future", Kerry said at a conference in London, where he was attending from Washington on Thursday 31 October via video link.
In his broadcast speech, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the US chief of diplomatic staff justified the intelligence and information-gathering practices by the necessary fight against terrorism and the prevention of possible attacks.
Referring to the attacks of 11 September 2001, the Madrid attacks of March 2004 and the London attacks of July 2005, John Kerry assured that since then the US authorities have thwarted many attacks by intercepting communications and gathering information.
"We have effectively prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being killed because we were able to know in advance about these projects", the US diplomat argued.
And, as John Kerry said to the Europeans, "I assure you that innocent people have not been deceived in this process".
But we're trying to gather information.
"And yes, in some cases it went too far inappropriately", admitted the Secretary of State, who had already had to speak out about the international scandal during a visit last week to Paris, London and Rome.
He assured Thursday night that President Obama was "determined to try to clarify and to review these practices so that no one feels deceived".
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to swell this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, the NSA was intercepting data from hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The paper, which cites documents obtained from former NSA consultant Edward Snowden, claims that the program, dubbed "MUSCULAR", and run with the UK counterpart of the NSA, GCHQ, allows these two agencies to retrieve data from optical fibers used by internet giants.
According to one document, some 181 million items were collected in the last month alone - from metadata to e-mails, to text items, to audio or video documents.
These intercepts are said to have taken place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have denied any connection to these practices.
For the past ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain and Italy have revealed that the NSA has intercepted massive amounts of data and communications from US allies and their leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European states and while leaks in the US press claimed that the US president was unaware of such wiretapping, Barack Obama refused to comment on the matter, citing national security.
But the head of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied that his intelligence agency had intercepted tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even sent the bullet back to European intelligence agencies who would have seized those communications, before giving them to the NSA.
This would involve "military operations" in countries where these NATO allies cooperate with the United States and would not at all target Europe, said General Alexander.
And the controversy was spreading to Asia on Friday.
Indonesia summoned the Australian ambassador, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast international spy network that has also provoked the ire of China.
Paris Saint-Germain will host Lorient on Friday without their injured manager, Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the Ligue 1 club announced in a statement.
PSG, the league's top scorer against Monaco, have released the list of players selected for the 12-day match, without the 32-year-old striker.
The statement simply says he is "injured", without specifying the nature of the injury.
However, he suffered from inflammation of the left knee during his recruitment at the beginning of the month.
A ceremony in memory of cremated dead
At 11 a.m., the Father Lachaise Crematorium holds a secular ceremony in memory of all the deceased cremated in the cemetery throughout the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a Socialist candidate for the Paris mayoral office, will attend and then explain her proposals for the funeral at a press conference.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
More and more French people choose cremation rather than burial for their own funerals: 53 percent, according to an Ipsos study conducted on September 6 and 7 on 1,009 people, instead of 47 percent.
The French prefer burial (53% vs. 47%) to the opposite.
If they're unlucky to lose a child, only 15% of them choose cremation.
In his book Death in Ashes, philosopher and vice-president of the National Committee on Funeral Ethics, Damien Le Guay, stresses the "violence" of cremation for survivors.
There is, with cremation, "violence against the beloved body", which will be "reduced to a pile of ashes" in a very short time, not after a decomposition process, which would "accompani the mourning phases".
There is also "symbolic violence", which is the "elimination of the singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymity" of the ashes.
Why is what is easily accepted in some Nordic and Protestant countries still poorly experienced in France?
"Because cremation is a new fact", answers Marie-Frédérique Bacque, president of the Society of Thanatology and author of the book Appropriating Death.
It has only been tolerated by the Catholic Church since 1963, so efforts to tame it have been limited.
The cremation was to be arranged by François Michaud-Nérard, director-general of the Funeral Services of the City of Paris, to provide for a ceremony as dignified as that to which he was entitled with an inhumation.
The annual survey by Ipsos shows a very strong commitment to the organisation of the ceremony.
77% of French people want a religious (53%) or civil (24%) marriage for their relatives.
Now, 73 percent of those who have chosen a cremation ceremony want a ceremony.
66% of atheists or non-believers also want it.
Crematoriums have adapted to this changing society.
"For about a decade they have been trying to prevent violence in families by waiting for an hour and a half without doing anything, immediately followed by the ashes", observes Michaud-Nérard.
70% of the institutions now offer ceremonial masters who, in the presence of the body, perform the following ritual: welcome the congregation, name the deceased, connect him with others, evoke him, make sense of his death, arrange the farewell.
This has been the case at Father Lachaise's crematorium since 1998.
The ceremony masters are often people who have converted.
There are also former Catholic priests.
In this context, since 2010, the Father Lachaise Crematorium has organized several secular and non-religious commemorative ceremonies on La Toussaint Day, inviting families of people who have been cremated during the year.
For the second year in a row, one of these ceremonies is broadcast live to those who could not make the trip.
The crematorium has given us permission to relay it.
In La Seyne, the resettlement of rats is a matter of controversy
Earlier this week, a family left their apartment on the ground floor of Fructidor D2 building due to the presence of rats.
In view of the urgency of the situation, the director of the Southern Lands Habitat Office has proposed, exceptionally and provisionally, to relocate the couple and their three children to a new T4.
But the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case has taken on exaggerated proportions, says the head of the office, Joël Canapa.
Rats, they've always been in the cities.
The distillery operates two passes a year and we also intervene on our own to meet the demands of the inhabitants.
We have thus delivered 64 interventions since the end of last winter.
The neighborhood is not abandoned, and rats do not swarm in the city.
For environmental and public health reasons, the products used for the treatment of the disease are four times less effective than in the past, but for two rats, you will not kill a child.
"We didn't invite rats into our homes", says the father who left his home to settle in the hotel.
We're soon out of money and waiting for a new place to stay, at the same price as the old one.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange is down 0.88%, news
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended up going down on Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The price has suffered a decline in the dollar against the yen, which is detrimental to export values and the annual profit warning issued by Sony on Thursday.
The Nikkei Index lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14 201,57 and the Topix lost 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1 183.03.
Sony has dropped more than 11 percent to 1,668 yen.
A house burns in Old Quebec
A fire that broke out Friday afternoon in Old Quebec was quickly contained.
More than 30 firefighters were dispatched to 9 Hébert Street.
The fire broke out in a three-story four-story house behind the courtyard of the Quebec Seminary.
All the tenants were absent when the fire broke out.
The fire was contained an hour after the firefighters arrived, and many intervened.
As soon as our first firefighters arrived, they really saw smoke.
"Then the alarms followed, because it took reinforcements to attack the building, because it's stuck here", said French Loiselle, a firefighter's spokeswoman in Quebec.
An investigation is underway to find the cause of the fire.
Ben Greenman: The 10th anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
You could say New York City is the birthplace of American stand-up: almost 100 years ago, vaudeville actor Frank Fay, who was the master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, started telling jokes directly in front of the audience, in the tone of the conversation.
Fay's innovation continued over the years, until it was picked up more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and overseen by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the stand-up club Carolines, the festival is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows in small clubs and big theaters.
 Most of the headlines emerged in the Carolinas, and they were very successful, until they became too famous to play in a club , Hirsch said.
We created this festival with the aim of continuing to work with them.
This year's event will feature Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of  Stand Up for Heroes , a comedy and music night for veterans, held at Madison Square Garden, with Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby among others.
The festival has grown in popularity, as has the comedy world.
Several of the comedians participating in this year's festival have gone through non-traditional tours, for example, presenting shows on small TV channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his front-running appearance in a cable sitcom ( The League on the FXX's cheerfully lascivious fantasy football theme) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate has appeared on Saturday Night Live and was cast in the series Parks and Recreation, but is best known for her viral video series Marcel the Shell with Shoes On.
Kroll and Slate, along with other young comedians with singular voices (the surrealist pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic advocate of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attractions of this year's festival will be an interview: David Steinberg talking to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but he became an accomplished film and television director, as well as an unofficial historian of comedy.
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a show on TV Land called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting is at City Hall in downtown Manhattan.
 The city is definitely in the comic DNA of all of Larry's work , Steinberg said.
He told me that when he was here, sometimes he would walk down an alley between two buildings and think, well, if I lost all my money, maybe I'd come and live here.
Oil prices continue to fall and are approaching $96 a barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as concerns about the size of stocks offset a report showing that China's electricity-hungry manufacturing sector is strengthening.
The price of US crude for delivery in December fell from 14 cents to $96.24 a barrel late this morning in Europe during electronic exchanges on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it down 5.8 percent for October.
The abundance of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said Wednesday that U.S. supplies increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
In five weeks, supplies have increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on China's manufacturing sector on Friday, which show growth in the business, suggest a rise in demand.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth bounced back to 7.8% in the third quarter, following a decline not seen for two decades in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, a benchmark for international crude already used by U.S. refineries, lost 26 cents to $108.58 a barrel on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) in London.
The right to abortion in Texas is challenged
A federal appeals court in Texas has restored some restrictions on the right to voluntary termination of pregnancy that were blocked by a trial judge this week.
This ruling means that a bill passed in July in that state that broadly challenges the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
The Court of Appeal's ruling means that doctors who will be performing IVG will have to have a "privilege of admission" to local hospitals.
Admission privilege is the right of a doctor, by virtue of his status as a hospital caregiver, to admit a patient to a hospital or medical centre for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment.
Proponents of IVF argue that the content of the law may result in the immediate closure of one third of the state clinics as these clinics have failed to obtain this "privilege of admission" for their practitioners.
In total, it is estimated that nearly 22,000 women are denied access to these institutions.
On Monday, a judge of the court of first instance had ruled that the provisions on the privilege of admission were unconstitutional on the eve of the entry into force of the law.
But Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, a Republican running for governor, has asked the Court of Appeals to overturn the trial court's ruling that blocked enforcement of the law.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star has made a strong comeback in the audience, with 1.3 million viewers behind their TV station, or 5.6% of the audience.
But was the show on the schedule?
Some 10,000 candidates have appeared for the auditions for this tenth season, to face the jury: Maurane, the villain Sinclair, the pervert André Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
Many were disappointed when they were excited to return to their favorite program.
But why such disappointment?
No candidate appears to have actually scored in this first prize.
As every year, the first auditions feature a wide selection of aspiring singers, for the best and sometimes for the worst.
Now, on Twitter, we want show, emotion, originality, music...
Fortunately, some have found their way.
Many have tried the New Star, and sometimes even made it to the end.
Behind the TV screens, the vocations of a successful singer are still there, season after season.
Some people just want to make people laugh.
The court blocks a decision regarding the NYPD's surveillance and search policy
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a judge's decision demanding changes to the New York Police Department's surveillance and search program and removed it from the case.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit stated that Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision was suspended until the city's appeal was completed.
The judge ruled in August that the city violated the Constitution by implementing its program to monitor and interrogate citizens.
The city appealed its findings and corrective orders, including a decision to assign a controller to help the police department change its policy and associated training program.
The Court of Appeal heard the arguments on the application for suspension on Tuesday.
The Court of Appeal held that the judge had to be dismissed from the case for violating the judges' code of conduct by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, partly because of a series of media interviews and public statements in which she publicly responded to criticism of the court.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by mistakenly targeting black and Hispanic men as part of their surveillance and search programs.
It appointed an external controller to oversee changes, including policy reform, training and supervision, and ordered the establishment of a pilot programme to test body-worn cameras in the areas where the greatest number of controls are carried out.
In August, the City of New York agreed to end the practice of keeping the names and addresses of people whose case is dismissed after a police check.
The hearing of the appeal by the City is scheduled to take place after 14 March 2014.
The tactic of surveillance and searching has been criticized by many civil rights advocates.
This system of checks and searches has existed in some form for decades, but the number of checks registered increased dramatically under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching its all-time high in 2011 with 684,330 checks that mostly involved black men and Hispanics.
A legal action was brought in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and it was transformed into a collective action.
Supporters of changes to the NYPD's surveillance and search program say they will end unfair practices, allow for more effective and trusted police forces, and change the way police departments use policy.
Opponents say these changes would undermine police morale without reducing crime, represent a waste of money and would not solve the broader problem of police forces under pressure after police personnel have been greatly reduced over the past decade.
The judge stressed that she was not ending the constitutional control and search practices, but that she was reforming the way the NYPD implemented its controls.
Renters have to go vote, because they each pay an average of $100 a month on the price of the housing that goes into taxes to the City.
When the landlord pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides that amount between each dwelling.
We're forced to raise rent to help us pay the new taxes.
When we go to the polls, we send a clear message.
We need to change things in the City.
All the candidates told us they were going to tackle the outrageous debt.
We can't afford $100,000 fireworks, $4 million to $5 million in land in case...
Go vote, it's the best way to express yourself and say enough is enough.
End of service for the chef of the Elysee
Entered the 500 square meters of Elysée kitchens as he was commissioned after working in embassies, the cook rose through the ranks to become chief nine years ago.
He served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to François Hollande to Nicolas Sarkozy, including on their vacation spots, and fed countless world leaders in a near-anonymity that he only breaks today, at the time of his retirement, at age 60.
The man with an open face, a degenerated skull and intellectual glasses, born on 24 October 1953 in Ferté-Saint-Aubin, has a pastry CAP.
His mother was a cook herself in a castle in Sologne.
"I have been from one castle to another!" ironizes Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the manners of the six presidents for whom he has served, but also their wives and some of their distinguished guests.
"It is always the head of state or his wife or wife who chooses the menus", he recalls.
"Mrs. Chirac was a little more involved, she came straight to the kitchen", to the point that she had forbidden women in the kitchens of the Elysee!
"They are all voracious eaters", says Bernard Vaussion, who is not happy with the heads of state who were relatively indifferent to land food.
Jacques Chirac certainly had "a slightly more developed appetite".
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the plates came back empty!
Francis Hollande, who restored cheese, "is a person who likes to eat" and "there is not much he does not like".
The current head of state, who regained the pounds lost before the presidential campaign, has "no specific regime request".
Bernard Vaussion also recalls the pressure on his shoulders, especially during state dinners at the Elysee: "between 200 and 250 people are served in about an hour".
The night before, it was almost white.
These people wouldn't understand that there are mistakes.
The now former chef of the Elysée, who had a drink on Tuesday night with his team, family and friends, leaves with a pinch of heart".François Hollande came to greet me".
He said something nice.
"His human side has come out", he says.
The head of the department will be replaced by his assistant, Guillaume Gomez, 35, who has been at the Elysée for 17 years.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec
A historic house built in 1850 caught fire in Old Quebec on Friday afternoon.
The four-bedroom building at 15 Hébert Street was the subject of three alarms from the fire department.
The fire started in the front but it spread to the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, a spokeswoman for the Quebec Fire Protection Service, said that the quick response of the firefighters has prevented the spread of flames to adjacent buildings, a major challenge for this area of the city where buildings are built in close proximity.
The house burned to the ground, and there were four dwellings, but no tenants were on the property at the time of the fire.
Damage was very limited, even though the water caused damage.
An investigation will be conducted to determine the source, but the suspects have dismissed the thesis as a criminal act.
The Wolf of Wall Street: Second trailer released
Martin Scorsese has omitted some footage from his next film, which will feature Leonardo DiCaprio as the title character, an ambitious New York broker.
Forget about being reasonable and take your notes out.
Leonardo DiCaprio is going to decode you in his role as a crazy trader.
Martin Scorsese tells the true story of a "Long Island stockbroker who refuses to cooperate with authorities in a massive Wall Street corruption case".
In the 1980s, Jordan Belfort then runs a scam that makes him a rich man, very rich.
The opportunity to follow his incredible ascent, but also the dizzying fall that will follow.
There's no limit to the man's chain of parties, women, drugs.
Decline and excess of all kinds are the key words of this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio couple seem to have found the magic that brought them together on Shutter Island.
The release of the new Scorsese was delayed due to its long assembly.
Looks like the movie's finally running 2:45.
In the theater on December 25th, he'll be able to take part in the Oscar race.
Coulson used the phone hacking to check a pipe.
Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson reportedly used  phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation  to try to confirm a dirty tip on a connection involving then-in-charge Home Secretary Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke was having an affair with Hannah Pawlby, his beautiful special counsel.
It was reported in court that the newspaper charged Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator, with hacking into Pawlby's voice box and constantly planting in front of his door, but Coulson also called her in and left her voice messages.
 The indictment suggests that Mr Coulson, who is now NotW's editor-in-chief, is not the kind of man to stand in front of people's houses hoping to surprise them, he is the kind of man who likes to present the story to people to see what they say about it , Mr Edis said.
He said NotW was using three methods to investigate the issues: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor-in-chief is personally involved in the third.
Obviously, he's aware of the second, surveillance, he can't be otherwise.
But what about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He says otherwise, but we say  Of course that .
Rumors of an affair involving Clarke were first picked up by NotW's editorial office when a source, experiencing sexual attraction to Miss Pawlby, said she had been told:  Don't waste your time with her, she's with Charles. 
A tape that contained hacked voice messages on his phone at least three times was seized at Mulcaire's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found seizures on the private investigator's computer involving Ms. Pawlby and her sister in a file  Projects .
During the time the detective was investigating her, Ms. Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr. Edis added.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw the surveillance of Miss Pawlby's every little deed and deed.
In a voice message he left him on June 18, 2005, Coulson said: "I have a story we plan to publish tomorrow that I would really like to talk to Charles about.
Mr. Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in the story followed the same pattern as other prominent men, such as former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson confronted Mr. Blunkett about an affair with a married woman while he himself was dating co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with others to hack into phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted to hacking their phones.
Barack Obama receives Iraqi Prime Minister, with violence on the rise
The US president was due to receive Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki of Iraq on Friday, November 1, 2013, seeking US help to fight the worst wave of violence in five years.
Iraq experienced its deadliest month in five and a half years in October, according to figures released Friday by Iraqi authorities.
964 people died in the violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The UN reports an even higher figure, with 979 dead and 1,902 wounded.
The violence is increasingly deadly despite increased security measures and large-scale military operations launched months ago by the Shiite-dominated government of Nouri Al Maliki.
The total death toll in October is the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people were killed.
About two years after the US troops withdrew, the level of violence fears a new outbreak as neighboring Syria is ravaged by civil war.
Bombs hit markets, mosques, weddings and funerals.
Men are shot in the street or even at home, and security forces are also frequently targeted.
The growing discontent of the Sunni minority in power under Saddam Hussein, who complained of being politically marginalized and the target of unjust arrests, has fueled this outbreak of violence.
On Friday, further violence killed four people in northern Iraq, following the deaths of at least 26 people in a series of attacks, including the blast of five trapped cars in northern Baghdad.
Much of the violence has been blamed on the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), an al-Qaida affiliate group (Sunni extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a "world war" against Al Qaeda.
The violence is at the heart of US Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki's talks, which will be hosted by President Barack Obama on Friday, two years after their previous meeting on December 12, 2011.
At the time, the U.S. president, elected on the promise of ending military involvement in that country, had drawn an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since arriving in Washington on Wednesday, Nouri Al Maliki has increased his meetings with the executive branch and the elected members of Congress.
On Thursday, he called for the international community to wage a "third world war" against Al Qaeda.
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic senators.
But the latter also criticized the Shiite Nouri Al Maliki, who was partly responsible for the resumption of violence by his "sectarian and authoritarian politics".
They also demanded that Barack Obama make it clear to Nouri Al Maliki that "Iran's pernicious influence within the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship".
Beijing accuses a Uyghur group of the Tiananmen attack
China's head of internal security on Friday accused a group of Xinjiang Uighur separatists of being behind the car bombing that killed five people on Tiananmen Square in central Beijing on Monday.
The vehicle, an SUV, hit a crowd in the famous square of the Chinese capital, a symbol of the 1989 murderous crackdown, and caught fire killing three passengers and two passengers.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau in charge of internal security, accused the Islamic movement in East Turkestan of being the instigator of the attack.
Many Uighurs, a Turkic-speaking minority living in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province East Turkestan.
The Chinese government believes that the movement is responsible for the frequent outbreaks of violence there, driven by demands for independence.
"The violent terrorist incident that took place in Beijing was organized and premeditated", Meng told Hong Kong's Phoenix TV.
"The group behind the scenes was the Islamic movement in East Turkestan", he added, quoted by the New China Agency.
The Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle, whose name suggests he is of Uyghur origin, and said his wife and mother were with him in the car.
The latter also contained containers filled with gasoline and a flag with Orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident left 42 people injured.
The Islamic movement in East Turkestan is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
Vatican investigates contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has begun a major survey around the world on how parishes handle sensitive issues such as contraception, divorce and same-sex couples.
The survey asked participants how priests treat gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without marriage bonds.
The survey was sent in mid-October to each national bishops' conference, with the aim of getting as many answers as possible.
The information will be used for a major family gathering that Pope Francis is planning to hold next year.
The news was reported Thursday by the "National Catholic Reporter", an independent Catholic newspaper in the United States.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide how to properly survey parishioners.
In the United Kingdom, bishops published the survey on the Internet asking Catholics to participate.
DRC: army attacks last rebel stronghold
The M23's unstoppable, a few hundred fighters, were cut off at nearly 2,000 metres above sea level on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jomba, two villages about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province.
"It has not stopped since this morning, the fighting continues despite the night", a Jomba resident told AFP, who was contacted by phone at about 12:30 am and said a girl was shot and wounded in the morning.
"The intensity of the clashes has decreased a little", he added, "it seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the DRC have pushed back the rebels a little".
The witness, who did not want to be identified, said the soldiers had "done the night" in Jomba before going to the front for a "screening operation".
There was a very clear crackling behind him with light weapons.
From Bunagana, the political stronghold and last stronghold of the rebellion that fell on Wednesday, an AFP journalist could hear heavy weapons detonations.
According to a source at the UN Stabilisation Mission in the DRC, the fighting has entered "a final stage", with the FARDC "surrounding the remaining M23 positions to dislodge them".
Since the resumption of the fighting between the 23 March Movement (M23) and the army on Friday, Monusco has not been directly involved in the fighting but has provided significant intelligence, observation and planning support to government troops.
Late in the afternoon, dozens of soldiers, well stocked with ammunition, were marching toward the front line.
They were armed with Kalashnikovs and rocket launchers.
Earlier, on the road to Bunagana, the border post with Uganda, civilian-assisted soldiers were loading a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a brand new FARDC truck, to ensure the replacement of another machine that was scouting the M23's positions on the hills.
Congolese President Joseph Kabila on Wednesday night once again called on the rebels to "voluntarily demobilize" under the threat of being disarmed "by force", but left open the Kampala process, where Kinshasa and the M23 have been discussing since December without results so far.
On the ground, the political leaders of the M23 hope to reach an agreement.
"We have finished the talks, it is only up to the Ugandan mediation to arrange the signing", said Roger Lumbala, vice-president of the M23 delegation, but this information cannot be immediately confirmed by the government.
The M23 was born in April 2012 from a mutiny of former rebels, mainly Tutsi, who joined the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The UN and Kinshasa have repeatedly accused Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M23, which Kigali and Kampala deny.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions of the DRC, and its underground is full of coveted mining resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where about 5,000 people had fled between Monday and Wednesday, according to the UN, the movement to return to the DRC that began in the morning reversed at noon.
"This morning we retreated to our fields, but the military told us to retreat", Imelda Nyirankusi told AFP, surrounded by her nine children, including one infant on her back.
It seems the gunfire is getting closer to the population.
Early in the evening, dozens of residents crossed the border, some with a mattress on their heads, to spend the night in Uganda.
The musical comedy, this stage beast
Classical, sophisticated, popular, English or French productions, singing and dancing take off.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds its voice.
It's a revolution: the French musical is a successful genre.
For a long time, from Notre Dame de Paris to Mozart's rock opera, most attempts were made without ridicule.
And successes like Cabaret and The Miserable wore the aurora of mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin at the Châtelet and Stage-Entertainment in Mogador changed the situation.
Today, these two scenes handle the headlines like success tubes.
The first one, this Christmas, takes up his excellent My Fair Lady and announces the next one, the world-wide creation of "An American in Paris".
In Mogador, "Beauty and the Beast" might be one of the biggest hits of the season.
In other scenes, musical shows like "1789", "The Lovers of the Bastille" and small musical comedies like "Disco" or "Life and Times" are set to the stage of success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "Histories of Musical Comedies" and lecturer at the Théâtre du Châtelet, analyzes the reasons for the success so hard won.
How are French musical comedies evolving?
The supply has multiplied.
First, there are the "musical shows" that evolve according to the producers' wishes...
Some use beautiful projections of images and a true story, like in 1789's The Lovers of the Bastille.
Others jump back 15 years on the pretext that you can use just about anything when you have Matt Pokora at the top of the billboard.
Then there are the musical comedies with the lavish productions of the Châtelet that bring back the golden age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.
Stage-Entertainment is promoting various Anglo-Saxon musical comedies by adapting them into French.
The French independent producers are trying to make a breakthrough.
But projects like Rent, Kiss the Spider Woman and Spring Awakening are struggling to be funded.
Do we have enough talented artists like Broadway singing, playing and dancing?
In Paris, when there are eight musical performances in a season, it's a big year.
We have 200 talented artists who turn projects into projects.
In the United States, the birthplace of musical comedy, it's very different.
Many schools train young people in these trades.
There are plenty of jobs in regional theaters, tours, Broadway, off-Broadway...
The talent pool is as important as the number of jobs.
Why are the provincial tours so successful?
With the exception of opera, the province remains the poor parent of culture in France.
Few plays go on tour and it is often the adult-oriented boulevard theatre rather than the young adult.
Music performances fill this gap.
These are the same young people who love reality TV and what it produces as ephemeral stars...
To put beautiful young men (often talented) on the front cover of a musical show is to ensure the affection of these young women and often their entire families.
The Facebook pages of these shows are skillfully maintained by professionals who answer questions.
These shows are highly anticipated when they arrive in a provincial Zenith.
Mayonnaise went up to Paris and tasted by the provincials.
The show is designed to enter all the major theaters of France in the same form as in Paris.
Seriously injured in a ghost driver accident on the Brussels ring
A serious road accident occurred on Friday morning at around 5.30 am on the inner ring of Brussels, at Hoeilaart, towards Waterloo.
A driver's car was hit by a ghost driver, who is unharmed.
The ring was closed to traffic until 9:00 a.m. at the scene of the accident, until the road is cleared and an expert determines the circumstances of the accident.
However, this situation caused little confusion as the accident took place at the Hoeilaart exit.
The traffic could therefore be diverted by this exit/entrance from the ring.
A child seriously injured in an attraction at Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old child was seriously injured in an accident at an attraction at Disneyland Paris.
His life expectancy is not yet confirmed, but he's still in the hospital.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat from the Caribbean Pirates attraction.
It's been closed until further notice.
DRC: army prepares for another assault
Children playing on a charcoal armor belonging to the M23 rebels in Kibumba, eastern DRC, on October 31, 2013.
The Congolese army was preparing for a new assault on the last strongholds of the M23 rebels near Bunagana, in eastern DRC on Friday.
The objective is to move the M23 from the hills overlooking Bunagana.
Yesterday we took Bugina Hill, which overlooks Mbuzi Hill.
Today, Mbuzi should fall by herself.
All that remains is Runyonyi Hill.
"The Chanzu campaign is not very strategic", said the governor of North Kivu, Julien Paluku.
Mr. Paluku is scheduled to go to Bunagana on Saturday.
The last stronghold of the rebellion, this village is located on the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was taken back by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred irreducible M23s have been cut off at nearly 2,000 metres above ground on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and the nearby village of Jomba
A resident in Jomba who reported close fighting on Thursday for the whole day said the situation was "calm since this morning".
He said a woman and her child were killed in the fighting the day before and were buried.
A girl was shot and three others were injured, including one seriously, evacuated by FARDC, the witness quoted by AFP added.
Since fighting between FARDC and rebels resumed on 25 October, the two warring parties have not reported any casualties.
NSA revelations increase corporate paranoia about state surveillance
On a beautiful day in late August, a German police helicopter flew low above the British Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
On the orders of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany's national intelligence agency, its mission was to photograph the roof of the US outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media reported that the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and that the operation prompted an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, the director of US intelligence, insisted again in September that the US is not using its foreign intelligence capabilities to steal foreign corporate industrial secrets on behalf of US companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits.
But since Edward Snowden, the consultant who became a whistleblower, began to reveal his inexhaustible wealth of information about the secrets of US surveillance, European governments and business leaders have become unsure whether to believe the director on word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency spied on the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to data held by U.S. cloud storage providers including Google and Yahoo have more than ever aroused corporate paranoia about state surveillance.
The revelation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been hacked, perhaps even for a decade, was the water drop that flooded the vase.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are certainly potential targets too.
Snowden made transparent the intense collaboration between US intelligence and corporate.
I think it is conceivable that these data should be used in their mutual interest.
 Germany must wake up , says Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, which represents German SMEs in the IT sector.
German companies believe the US poses as much risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by consultancy firm EY.
However, in all the documents disclosed by Mr Snowden, there is no indication to date that the United States has passed industrial secrets of foreign companies to American companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU does not have sufficient IT and Internet capabilities and believe it should work to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Corporate leaders are skeptical about this.
A German parliamentarian says we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly reopen them...
 This is not the right way to do it  says Hasso Plattner, president of the German enterprise software company SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we shouldn't have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars to farmers.
All but the IT industry.
Yet the scale and sophistication of the U.S. spy agencies exposed by Snowden's revelations has been a shock to some companies who until then thought China was the biggest surveillance risk.
A major shift is taking place in cloud computing as European officials have become aware that data held in the United States is governed by the laws of that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional organization, about 10 percent of non-U.S. members have given up plans to use a U.S. cloud storage service provider after the revelations about the U.S. data mining program Prism.
Jim Snabe, SAP's co-director, says:  Our customers are asking us a question today that they didn't ask us a year ago: where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they will physically remain in that jurisdiction? 
Many German leaders say that the latest reports are only confirmation of what they already knew, that powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and that this data must therefore be kept at all costs.
It's no wonder there's economic espionage.
There's always been.
 This has been a recurring topic for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the current discussion  says Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF Chemicals.
The Americans spy on us on the trade and industrial level just as we spy on them, because it's in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders are generally unwilling to disclose the prevention measures they have put in place, in case this leaves an opponent with an advantage.
Big companies have long been hammering the message that it is at least unwise to retrieve a free USB drive from a business lounge or leave an unattended laptop in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of directors of the carmaker Audi, says that collecting cell phones before board meetings so that they cannot be used as remote listening devices has been a common practice for years.
The German BfV advises its executives to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones when travelling abroad because of the risk of compromising the integrity of smartphones.
The prepaid cell phones are then thrown away.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their niche.
 SMEs often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets from unauthorised access , warns the BfV in a report.
The United States is alerting its own companies to economic espionage activities by other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) conducted in February by the United States cited France, along with Russia and Israel, as second-degree perpetrators of economic intelligence hacking behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of a renowned German company believed that when it came to economic espionage, the French were the worst.
Bernard Squarcini, former director of French domestic intelligence, DCRI, said in an interview this month:  The services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies. 
Parents of a teenager in Georgia who died under unusual circumstances believe their son was murdered
The parents of a teenager in Georgia, whose body was found in a rolling wrestling mat in his high school gym, believe their son was murdered, the family's lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 trapped in a upholstered rug behind the gym steps at his high school.
Lowndes County Sheriff's investigators concluded that Johnson died under unusual circumstances, but the 17-year-old's family disputes these findings.
 They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered , said Benjamin Crump, the lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, on FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as indicated in the sheriff's findings.
 They think it defies all logic, the laws of physics and common sense , Crump added.
They believe that these conclusions were made solely to cover up the person or persons responsible for their son's death.
They sent their son to school with a wallet and it was returned to them in a body bag, he added.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several important questions remained unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I'm gonna follow the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
 I believe there is a sufficient basis  to open an official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the first autopsy indicated Johnson had died of positional asphyxia.
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
 Several questions still need to be answered or confirmed , he said.
Moore added that if he uncovers evidence that would warrant a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The Lowndes County Sheriff's Office representative was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him Thursday.
A judge in southern Georgia ordered the authorities on Wednesday to turn over all surveillance video recordings that investigators had examined.
The teenager's parents said they hoped the video footage would provide clues about the circumstances of his death.
CDC publishes child allergy advice for schools
On Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a series of guidelines on how to manage food allergies in children at school.
This is the first set of guidelines issued by the US government, as the number of school-age children with food allergies has risen sharply.
One in 20 children in the United States now suffers from a food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to raise awareness among teachers and staff about food allergies in children and how to treat them in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools stockpile epinephrine  the EpiPen branded self-injector being the most commonly used  to be able to react quickly in the event of potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
State legislatures recently updated regulations to make it easier for schools to stockpile epinephrine.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Kids can say,  I feel like something's biting my tongue ,  I feel like I have a hair on my tongue  or  I have tingling on my tongue .
The NSA case highlights the total absence of intelligence debate
How can we explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which on the one hand is publicly outraged by the summons of the US ambassador on 21 October, and on the other hand prohibits the flight of the Bolivian presidential plane over the territory, based on the rumor that Edward Snowden was on board?
I think there are two levels of response from the French government.
When François Hollande calls Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summons the US ambassador, they react to a real discovery, which is the extent of US surveillance of all communications in France.
Is it not surprising to read in the World columns a few weeks apart, on the one hand, the reproduction of US diplomatic correspondence and on the other hand, a condemnation of the NSA's listening in the Quai d'Orsay?
Wouldn't that be a little bit of a hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral positioning, but the search for the interest and relevance of information that allows each citizen to form an opinion.
When WikiLeaks takes the veil off the analysis by US diplomacy of political or other issues around the world, we actually consider that, in the eyes of US power, this is an important enlightenment.
When we describe the American interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, it is not in any way to be outraged by this practice, but to describe the world as it is.
Did France benefit from information provided by the NSA regarding terrorist operations targeting our interests?
Can we deprive ourselves of American cooperation?
The United States and France have been using very powerful technology to intercept the terrorists for a decade.
In this area, France and the United States in particular have established procedures for cooperation and exchange of information almost daily and both sides describe them as essential.
For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas of Miranshah was reported to the French through the NSA.
France can be led, for example, to transmit entire blocks of data on the Sahel region to US services, and in return, as we have already said, the Americans can give information to the French about other parts of the world.
So the fundamental question behind this NSA case is not so much the ability or right of countries to have interception tools, but the question of the total absence of prior debate, particularly in parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the scope that should be theirs, and ultimately the question of freedom violations.
What is the real risk for the United States, a deterioration in its image?
No matter how we denounce them, I don't see how they can be punished.
The risk Americans are taking may be double.
The first is when their allies -- and it was recently -- learn that their leaders, sometimes at the highest levels of their state, have been monitored.
This is the case in Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have been strained.
Another effect may be more economical: more and more European or South American companies are reluctant, in light of the revelations, to entrust their confidential data to US service providers subject to US law, and therefore to the control of the NSA.
Finally, the vast movement of revelations by the world's media, which is helping to spark a debate about virtually nonexistent intelligence surveillance practices, could prompt lawmakers, including Americans, to reconsider the powers they have given their intelligence services.
Parents of intersex children can choose  indefinite sex 
Germany became the first European country to recognize a third sex for babies born with ambiguous sexual organs.
The gender of newborn males and females will no longer be strictly attributed to them at birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to declare the sex of their child, allowing them to enter an indeterminate sex on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could make hasty decisions about sex reassignment surgery for their infant and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
According to the BBC, an intersex person would have said years later, "I'm neither a man nor a woman".
I'll stay the patchwork the doctors created, bruised and baffled.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, intersex being part of the group of 60s diagnosed as sexually developmental disorders, a generic term for people with atypical chromosomes or gonads (ovaries or testicles) or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersex.
Sexual identity is still not well understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is best to use the best available information to assign it, and then wait and follow the child's psychological and physical development before considering surgery, if necessary.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist in New York and a specialist in sexual identity issues, said the new German law  seems like a good idea .
Intersex children pose an ethical dilemma.
 Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require surgery, but this is not the case for most children , he added.
You can have a sex assignment without surgery, and see how the identity develops.
The science of how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why this happens.
It's like the mystery surrounding gay people.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transgender or transgender people, since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively that of a man nor exclusively that of a woman, but is generally both at the same time and not clearly defined as either.
These characteristics may manifest themselves in secondary sex characteristics, (such as muscle mass, hairy body, chest and stature), primary sex characteristics (such as reproductive organs and sexual organs), or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also gave an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the extent of harassment and violence and prejudiced crimes.
Young boys of non-compliant sex now have camps specifically for them.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to register male, female or third gender on their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian woman, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to be recognized  neutral  after winning her appeal trial that allowed her to keep an unspecified gender  for life.
German passports will have a third designation next to M or F  X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still a matter of controversy, according to a report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers in this largely Catholic country signed a petition to remove the  gender theory  from school textbooks.
The American Catholic Online website also opposed the German law, writing that  since the world is dragged into a new reign where gender is a choice but sexual activity is not one, two other pillars of civilization are being overthrown. 
In Maryland, the mother of an infant also said on Baby Zone that she would prefer that sex be assigned to babies at birth.
 The role of parent is sufficiently stressful without any further restrictions, especially if you do not know the gender of your child , she said on the website for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, babies born without male or female sex organs were called hermaphrodites, after the magnificent Greek god of double sex.
And just a decade ago, the medical community saw the genre as a clay, which can be erased and redesigned on.
But now many are questioning the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that sex identity is complex and that sometimes doctors can be wrong, not knowing how a child will feel about his sexual reassignment when he grows up.
 In the mid-20th century, this was called a psychiatric emergency, Drescher said.
When these kids were born, we didn't call the psychiatrist, we called the surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with ambiguous sex organs was put forward by Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who considered gender to be malleable.
He dedicated the term  sexual identity  and argued that social and environmental signals  the way parents raise a child  interact with a child's genes and hormones to shape him so that he is identified as male or female.
But in a case in 1966, known as  John/Joan , his theories gave rise to controversy.
He had advised the parents of a young boy whose penis had been cut off during a bad circumcision to have him completely castrated, also removing his testicles, and to raise him as a girl.
 Money presented this as a successful transition case, but it was not the case , Drescher said.
When he was about 15 years old, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors  always repeat this pattern .
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these sex change operations say they're not satisfied with the results.
This is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but with ambiguous sex organs.
Doctors couldn't really tell if he had a wide clitoris or a small penis and were convinced he could never have a satisfying life as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce had an outer organ and testicles removed by surgery and was raised as a girl.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
 I knew I wasn't a girl , he told ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he underwent a vaginal surgery.
But depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he asked for his medical records.
What he discovered horrified him.
I was sterilized at birth and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with a sexually developmental disorder (DDS) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for his sexual organs to develop.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, taking testosterone therapy and having his breasts removed.
The surgery made him infertile.
Today, he is a social activist for the Interface Project, an organization that seeks to standardize the perception of intersex people.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, general manager of California-based nonprofit Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that German law  calls for labeling and stigma.
 Many activists are concerned that German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and give their child an "undetermined" sex, she said.
We're afraid she might encourage the intervention.
We think it's better to assign a male or female gender, and wait.
But we didn't see what the law would provide, so we can only make assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said her organisation supported Australian law because it allowed adults to choose to be recognised as the third gender.
 Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal gender , she added.
The German law concerns the attribution of sex at birth.
It's not a battle that young children should fight at that age.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh mammogram radiologist whose daughter has a sexual developmental disorder and who helps thousands of people in a support group, said that German law would hold parents and children accountable.
Dr. Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Because of the failure of her androgen receptors, Katie developed some feminine traits.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Katie is now 29 years old, married, and an intern in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although barren, she hopes to have children through adoption or surrogacy.
 The law leaves some room for parents to make decisions without hurry  Baratz said.
This gives them time to do some tests and understand them, and a delay before they write  male  or  female .
So everything's fine. You can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and you enjoy being a parent.
You don't have to rush into surgery that's irreversible.
 This puts children at the heart of the decision and mitigates the anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid of not doing the right thing , she said.
Finally, the child will decide which sex he/she feels most comfortable with  and that is something great.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
Letta confident in the longevity of his government
Italian Council President Enrico Letta believes that his government will hold until 2015 despite the strong left-right tensions within the ruling coalition as the Senate vote to remove Silvio Berlusconi from office approaches.
In an interview with the daily La Stampa, the centre-left leader said he had "firm intention" to continue to govern with his coalition until the next parliamentary elections in 2015.
The upper house of the Italian parliament will meet later this month to decide the fate of the former Council president convicted of tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatened to withdraw his support for the government if the Senate, where he has more opponents than supporters, declares his removal.
But a part of his camp, grouped around the national secretary of the People for Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated on 2 October by his refusal to yield to the orders of Berlusconi who already wanted to topple the cabinet.
The L.A. Times reports that an agent of the U.S. Transportation Safety Agency, TSA, and a suspect were wounded in the exchange of gunfire.
Firefighters called to the scene said they had responded to a call reporting "multiple injuries".
"Law enforcement is on the scene", the airport said on Twitter, while television footage showed people being evacuated in ambulances.
"There was a shooting", a spokesman for the US Transportation Safety Agency (TSA) told AFP.
Local ABC broadcast showed one person being evacuated on a couch, and another being transported in a wheelchair.
The incident occurred around 9:30 local time (12:30 in Montreal) at Terminal 3 of the airport, the airport also said.
The Los Angeles Times reports that Terminals 2 and 3 are being evacuated.
The TSA spokesman was unable to confirm immediately whether any of its employees were injured.
All flights to and from the airport have been suspended.
Israeli army kills Hamas member in Gaza
Israeli tank fire killed a Palestinian Islamist Hamas militant on Thursday and seriously injured another in the southern Gaza Strip, according to health service sources.
A source from Hamas explained that fighting broke out in the area as Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by Palestinian mortar shots.
The Israeli army has merely mentioned a "targeted action" in the area near a tunnel dubbed "terrorist" by the Hebrew state, dug at the border and announced to have been discovered in mid-October.
Report: Obama's campaign seen as dropping Biden for Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisers have been considering, in the utmost secrecy, replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most notable event in Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's highly anticipated 2012 campaign book,  Double Down: Game Change 2012 .
The Times obtained a copy of the book and reported Thursday night that close aides to the president had conducted extensive group work and polls in late 2011 to see if Biden's ouster could help Obama win re-election as his hopes dwindled.
According to Times political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed analysis of the work of senior campaign and White House officials, namely former White House Secretary General Bill Daley, to measure the effect the replacement of the vice president by former Secretary of State Clinton could have on the election.
The possibility of a trade is a secret that has been fiercely guarded within the Chicago campaign headquarters and inside the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen close advisers to the president  including Daley, former Obama campaign leader Jim Messina and former White House advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe  knew the change was under consideration.
 Double Down  indicates that Daley took the lead to replace Biden, despite their  close personal ties , before finally deciding against the change when the numbers showed that having Clinton on the presidential list  did not significantly improve Obama's chances of success .
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
 I said I had looked at a whole series of questions, and that was one of them , Daley told the paper.
Remember, the president was not fit at the time, so we were like, "Lord, what can we do?"
While Daley called the review "concerted", Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had invested heavily to find out if change would be beneficial in the election.
 Campaigns don't spend much money on surveys and discussion groups unless they seriously consider taking action , Martin told AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama was aware that his team was considering the replacement.
Martin told CNN he asked Daley if his then-boss was aware of the potential change.
Although Daley said he did not think President Obama was aware of the potential change, the former Secretary General admitted that it was possible Obama was aware.
Martin added that  Double Down  did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether political polls had reached Obama's office.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama didn't know that Biden's removal from the presidential list was under review.
"Maybe", Martin said.
Would you like some ice cream?
A British entrepreneur created the world's first fluorescent ice cream made from jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminescent snack.
He got the idea after reading a study on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate the shiny protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing the pH of the protein to make it shine.
Chris explains that since ice cream starts to glow when it reacts to the heat from the mouth, the more you lick, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company Lick Me I'm Delicious, said: "It's amazing, but we're still in the very early stages of production, and 2 g of this stuff costs about £200".
The protein we use in ice reacts with the pH neutral tongue.
So when your mouth heats up the protein, the pH level rises and the ice starts to glow.
We've been testing it for the last few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone on Halloween because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice I've ever created because the luminescence of jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
So each ball costs me about £140.
But she tastes good !
Charlie's Bristol-based experimental company is known for its unusual ice cream fragrances such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his next creation is even more ambitious.
He added:  I really want to develop an invisible ice. 
It's inherently impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I think I'll find a way to do it.
The ice uses the fluorescent properties of the jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a tai chi session.
Singer Lou Reed died while doing tai chi exercises, his wife Laurie Anderson revealed Thursday in a letter published by the regional newspaper East Hampton Star and addressed to residents of the city of Springs, where the couple owned a home.
The artist died last Sunday at the age of 71.
"He died Sunday morning, looking down at the trees and performing the famous 21st tai chi movement, with his musician's hands ripping through the air", writes Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was a master of Chinese martial arts.
The singer's wife also says that the week before her death, she had promised her husband that she would get him out of the hospital and take him to their home in Springs, Long Island.
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in the last few years.
And even though we're city dwellers, it's our spiritual home.
"Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs about the pain and beauty of the world will convey to many the tremendous joy of life he had", she adds.
Lou Reed had a liver transplant last May.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, go to bed late, and disguise ourselves to go to the neighborhood.
Today I've become more ping-pong.
I haven't handed out a single candy in the last two years, and I certainly won't this year.
But the stats show that I'm the goat when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans  158 million of them will actually  celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to every Halloween holiday is trends.
The costumes are expected to be $1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, the inanimate sexy objects are furious.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods like pizzas, hamburgers and carrots.
As for men, I expect to see a lot of zombies, thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, and I bet that the men from the Daft Punk space will be among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after disguises are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess it's okay to stay traditional.
We disguised our dogs last year, and to my great surprise, they weren't the only ones.
In fact, Americans are going to spend $330 million on animal disguises this year, according to the NRF.
That's a lot of curious dogs in hot dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't glandulate.
Americans are going to spend $1.9 billion on candy this year, according to Nielsen.
That's about 272 million pounds of Hershey bars, soda, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is great news for the 41 million children who go to the candy hunt in their neighborhood, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we're going to buy and, let's not tell ourselves stories, consume 41 million pounds of chocolate on Halloween.
The only thing we don't want to eat is corn candy, and yet nearly 16 million pounds are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
That's about 9 billion cornseeds.
It's a mystery I haven't figured out yet.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than haunted houses.
They have the best names, like  Terror Behind the Walls  (which is actually a real prison),  Howl-O-Scream  and  The House of Shock .
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States, which generate about $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes these amazing pictures of you peeing on them that your friends put on Facebook and you can't remove and that a guy you like leaves a comment on like, "Pretty head".
Finally, let's talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to The Big Caterpillar when we were kids, and carving a pumpkin in the shape of a lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree.
Fortunately for us, the  trend of the baby-sitter only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us carved these pots and didn't have to sit in them.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The light-dried pumpkins on your porch probably came from Illinois, where 542 million pumpkins were grown this year.
If you want to get more attention, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try carving their 922-pound pumpkin.
Royal Bank of Scotland will create an internal 'bad bank' with £38bn (€45bn) of the most risky assets, a move aimed at easing its links with London and accelerating its reprivatisation.
The Bank wants to reduce the proportion of doubtful assets in its balance sheet from 55% to 70% in the next two years and hopes to have it completely cleaned up within three years.
RBS also said it would write a further £4 to £4.5 billion doubtful claims write-off provision for the quarter, a write-up linked to the establishment of the cantoning structure.
RBS also stated that this internal restructuring would release between £10 billion and £11 billion of capital, thus strengthening its lending capacity.
The Bank and London stressed that the 'bad bank' would be a throwback to the past, with the government being particularly accused of interfering with RBS management.
"We can now move forward, worry about the future and the 90% of assets that make up a really good bank and build a big bank for the customer and for the UK", the new CEO Ross McEwan told the press.
Land Rover announces sponsorship of a series of rallies
The interior has six-pointed bucket seats and harness belts, as well as an Intercom system.
Options include improved brakes, a service that gives access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and vehicle storage between events.
Bowler Motorsport CEO Drew Bowler said:  Rally enthusiasts joining Bowler have changed. 
Not all are experienced, some are looking for excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are very pleased to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we are confident that it will be a new way to try different forms of rallying in the UK and internationally, and to prepare for the rigors and realities of raiding rallies.
We had a lot of fun developing the Defender Challenge vehicle. The championship is going to be really exciting.
The Defender Challenge will also offer a training and testing day in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighters were called to rescue a puppy who was lost after being trapped 15 meters above the ground on an unstable cornice in a quarry.
Ruby, a Spanish cockroach, escaped after a non-severe car accident
She was spotted three days later by a person walking her dog stuck in the quarry.
Firefighters have descended the cliff to recover the dog and save her from certain death.
A puppy was lucky enough to escape the worst after firefighters were called in to retrieve him safely as he was perched 15 metres above the ground on the unstable slope of a cliff.
Ruby, a nine-month-old Spanish cockroach, escaped after a car accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being rescued in a quarry on Wednesday.
Its owners, Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, went to Flappit's quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had been desperately searching for their lost dog and made a call on social media after she disappeared in the quarry following a minor accident.
At about 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a person with a sharp-sightedness walking their dog spotted Ruby on a corridor in the quarry, stuck 15 meters above the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene and descended as a wake-up call to save Ruby using an animal mattress to transport her up the cliff.
Technical rescue specialist Andy Clayton said:  She was in a precarious situation. 
It was right in the middle of the cliff, 15 meters from the top and 15 meters from the ground.
She didn't move at all during the rescue. She was frozen.
But she's fine now.
She ate cookies afterwards.
It was a very unusual call.
It's amazing that someone noticed the dog.
Technical rescue specialist Peter Lau said:  Ruby was very lucky to get out of it unscathed. 
She could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a check-up; her overall condition was satisfactory, apart from exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "I was terrified to see the rescue.
I didn't think she was up there at first.
It was amazing to have her in my arms again.
The vet said that if she had been too tired and fainted, she would probably have fallen.
The fire department was amazing.
What they did was really brave.
We're so grateful to them, and each of them has been absolutely awesome.
Mr Alderson, from Keighley, added: 'We were afraid she would fall but she didn't move.
The fire department was great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Mick Jagger says he never dredged Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview on an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she was a chorusist on Jagger's song  Old Habits Die Hard  in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, "He drove me when I was 18".
She added, "It was a long time ago, and he was very kind".
In a statement Thursday, a Jagger representative, 70, said he "strongly denies making any advances against Katy Perry".
The representative added:  Maybe she confuses him with someone else. 
Perry was one of the singers to make an appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album,  Prism , debuted at number one on the charts this week.
Beijing is challenging a Turkmen Islamic movement
"Backstage support for the attack came from the East Turkestan Islamic Movement based in Central and Western Asia", the head of China's security services told a Hong Kong television channel, according to a video posted on a website Thursday night.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC), was speaking in Tashkent during an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time a Chinese official has designated a particular organization since Monday's attack.
According to Chinese police, three Uyghurs from a single family in the Muslim-dominated region of Xinjiang, bordering several Central Asian countries, rushed their car loaded with gasoline cans to the entrance of the Forbidden City in Beijing in a suicide attack that killed two people and injured 40.
The driver of the car, his wife and mother died in the car fire.
The Etim, which claims to fight for the independence of East Turkestan, formerly known as Chinese Xinjiang, was ranked by the UN in 2002 among Al-Qaeda affiliated organizations.
This movement is often cited by Chinese authorities as responsible for the sporadic unrest in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: The break-up of Europe gives the Scots a choice
Another day, another disturbing story of independence.
This time, we are being warned that an independent Scotland would have to join the European free movement zone to join the EU.
And now we hear stories of passport control in Berwick and a border of barbed wire along Hadrian's Wall.
While it is true that the Strathclyde newspaper reported the possible economic consequences of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, this was not in the headlines (and was to be expected).
Nor did anyone say that EU Member States spend much of their time bypassing their formal rules when it suits them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, a continued non-compliance with the rules would be a small concession that Brussels could offer in return for anything it wants from Scots.
So this is not a story.
And a story so old that it's now frozen: I first heard the gossip that  independence means passport control over 40 years ago.
Yet, we have forgotten an interesting point in this interpretation of an old dust tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow Europe's instructions, in fact?
Why trade the yoke of London for that of Brussels, especially now?
The real news about Europe is this: the postwar plan to unite Europe is definitely deadlocked.
With the euro crisis, the Europe Project is officially dead.
Across Europe, parties opposed to the EU or advocating the abandonment of the euro as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party, founded only this year and coming out of nowhere, gathered almost five million votes in the federal elections in September and pulled the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent to our Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
There has always been national opposition to the proposal to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis marked a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled with the burden on national economies through accession to the single currency, has led many to believe that the Europe Project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments running excessive budget deficits  this was only true for Greece.
The European system has instead imposed favourable exchange rates on its members for German exporters, which German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluing the national currency, the countries of southern Europe are left with an inherent productivity problem vis-à-vis Germany.
The only way forward is to make the grim cuts in wages and public spending encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the current budgetary and monetary problems, there is a deeper discomfort in productivity in Europe.
Following the green energy policies imposed by Brussels which are a reason to subsidise French and German energy companies at consumer expense, European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than the United States.
This is a cost-effective re-publication disadvantage, as we have seen in Grangemouth.
All the world's wage gains will not prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalized by cheap US shale gas.
As a result, the revolt has been one of the major drivers of the EU, particularly in France.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a means of controlling Germany and putting Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for its political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving the French economy in a state of disrepair.
The result: Marine Le Pen's far-right party, the anti-European Front National, has just won a crucial by-election, putting the Socialists in power back in third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote  a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot start on the principle that a split of the right will automatically favour the left.
What is Marine Le Pen doing with her newfound popularity among the French white working class?
It wants to use the European elections next year to create a single anti-money and anti-European bloc within the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties are successful in these elections, which is very possible, such a bloc could control the European Parliament for the first time.
This is what I think: very soon, the anti-European and anti-monetary sentiment in Europe will unite and eventually kill the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something more like the free Europe of Nations (sovereign) privileged by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will have their own currency.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project, and I hope it will be mildly appreciated by the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left behind in the Atlantic.
What about Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a region of small England (essentially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending people around Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that Scotland could settle for a freer European agreement provided we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of Nations.
Otherwise, we should be following Norway's example and maintaining our economic independence.
The Scottish SNP government is  and it is worth noting  the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, having won a dramatic majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the dark cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition that followed.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to vote for independence if it were to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Early aging
Studies show that African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls.
Changes in body shape do not mean puberty is imminent
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe the obesity epidemic could be a trigger for early puberty
The tendency to puberty early is not as pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in family and child health issues.
Should a mother worry if her daughter's breasts and pubic hair start growing at seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American youth and represent a new norm.
 I spend a lot of time reassuring parents  in general, this does not indicate a rapid development towards full puberty , Kaplowitz said.
Obvious signs of development, such as swollen breasts, hair under the arms and pubic area, and body odors, appear earlier in girls.
But there has been only a slight advance from the age of first menstruation over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half, up from 12 in 1970.
 Once the breast has started to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the first menstrual period appears , said Kaplowitz, also the author of  Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem .
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty will develop.
There is debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but it is considered to be early when the breast develops with sudden growth before the age of 8.
In most cases, development slows or stops  this is something a pediatrician can follow closely.
A faster progression may warrant tests by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the onset of the first period and prevent other consequences: premature bone ageing that can slow growth and a small height in adulthood.
Recommendations for drug and hormone treatment are based on the child's age, developmental rate, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious about medications but acknowledges that  controlling puberty can alleviate certain behavioral problems and the feeling for young girls to be different from others 
The other big problem is understandable: Parents simply don't want their very young daughters to have their period.
 They fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they will handle hygiene issues , Kaplowitz said.
 It was a shock , remembers a woman whose daughter had her first period at the age of 10.
Even though there were signs and we talked about the rules, she wasn't emotionally prepared.
She came home from school scared and upset about being the first of her friends.
There are many theories that have been made public about the causes of early puberty.
Yet there is no consistent theory that the hormones in milk or other foods, the chemicals in the environment, or the sexual messages carried by the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz says the most credible hypothesis is the obesity epidemic.
He was involved in a study of girls aged 6 to 9 years that linked the percentage of fat mass to the onset of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls.
There are various explanations.
Worldwide, the mechanisms of early puberty seem to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another problem: Although boys have hair on their faces and in the pubic area younger, the tendency toward true early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference stressed the complexity of the subject.
Acne and pubic hair are common, even in infants and toddlers.
 We need to be careful about how we identify the true onset of puberty , said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek advice from their pediatrician about how to communicate with their children.
 This may mean having a conversation earlier than planned , Kaplowitz explained.
If you stay calm, your child will respond well.
Girls who are in early puberty need to be reassured that even when it happens earlier than expected, the process is part of life.
The Coen Brothers' tribute to folk
Coen Brothers' "Inside Llewyn Davis", the last Cannes Film Festival Grand Prix, is a nostalgic and funny film about the Greenwich Village of 1961 and the folk music that was just beginning to resonate with it, before Bob Dylan arrived.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography was recently retrospective at the French Film Festival, won the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
If Dylan or the Peter, Paul and Mary trio could not be hired, Joel and Ethan Coen turned their attention to the rising star of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33, and also to the planetary pop star Justin Timberlake.
In this humorous film where music is a central character and songs are performed live, Oscar Isaac reveals himself to be an accomplished folk musician and singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves pop for folk music with a contagious jubilation.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left Daisy Mulligan's rich outfits in "Gatsby the Beautiful" for less shiny clothes, a soft voice when she sings, but the oath owed to the machine gun when she speaks.
Inside Llewyn Davis tells the story of a week's worth of trouble for a folk singer who can't break through and gets angry with the whole world.
He's willing to back off the high-five replacements in the studios.
Without a home, he's out on the couches of his friends who still want to welcome him.
It's a documentary
"His relationship with success is tortured, that's what we were interested in: a mix of bad luck, a guy who's not there at the right time, who's not career-minded but integrity-minded, with self-destructive behavior", said Ethan Coen, who won several Oscars and awards with his brother Joel at Cannes.
If Llewyn Davis did not exist, the two folk music fans built their story on real figures of the time like folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment before the arrival of Greenwich Village, a New York City neighborhood that would become "the epicenter of the rise of folk music that would produce international stars", as Van Ronk's friend Elijah Wald writes.
The film then takes on a documentary look, from the dusty music label infested with 33T unsold inhabited by an unpaid old secretary, to the music choices of the studios of the time and the cafes where the singers performed.
The Coen brothers' magic still works by incorporating a funny character who keeps going through the film: a beautiful red cat with a cracking eye, Llewyn Davis's fortune companion.
Asked how he composed his character, actor and singer Justin Timberlake recalled having "grown up in Tennessee, bathed in blues and country".
"My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me to play guitar", he added.
For Justin Timberlake, while work is necessary to "be considered good", "chance can also launch someone's career", and "increasingly today".
Like Llewyn Davis, who refuses to compromise on his music, the pop star explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to get caught up in anything that can stop us from expressing ourselves".
Gerard de Villiers, the author of "SAS", is dead.
He'll never know the word retirement.
The French publisher, Gérard de Villiers, who died on Thursday at the age of 83, had just published his 200th SAS, "The Kremlin's Revenge".
In February, The New York Times called him "the author of the spy novel who knew too much".
He had just spent ten days in Afghanistan, playing the 198th and 199th installments of the famous spy novel series.
He was physically impaired by a very serious heart attack in December 2010, and he was traveling on a walking tour.
And before Afghanistan, he had also gone to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SASs published a year, Gérard de Villiers, born on 8 December 1929 in Paris, made sure to ignore the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first in the series, nearly half a century ago.
"There is no doubt that between 120 and 150 million countries combined", he said last March.
His Burmese cat on his knees, in the living room of his huge apartment in a building on Foch Avenue two steps from the Arc de Triomphe, the evil eye under his white hair, quoted some of the languages in which SAS' adventures were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Not counting pirate editions", he added, pointing to a pile of books on the bottom table among the bronze or ivory brought back from 130 countries to place his novels.
For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader is entitled to the traditional cover with a photo of a young woman with a good-sized chest, carrying a gun or assault rifle.
Inside, his serene Highness Prince Malko Linge, a disgraced Austrian aristocrat and CIA contractual agent to pay for the family castle repairs, is raiding all the villains of the earth, communists in the 1970s and 80s, then jihadists from the 1990s onwards.
Each book has the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitics and exoticism, some hard sex scenes, a zest for violence and torture.
"I never claimed to be a literary writer", explained Gérard de Villiers.
I consider myself a storyteller who writes to distract people I don't send a message to.
He worked "like the great prewar reporters, like Albert London, who went to the scene and came back with real, long investigations".
SAS' father said "do some kind of geopolitical show".
"I keep my records (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before I leave", added Gérard de Villiers.
There I meet journalists, including those from AFP, diplomats, service personnel, some of whom I have known for 20 or 30 years.
Many of his SAS members were therefore often premonitions: for example, a month before the attack on a Syrian regime command center that killed several senior officials, he had told the story in "The Damascus Road".
In "Mad Men of Benghazi", he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command center in this city, the birthplace of the Libyan uprising.
In 1980, he was cast in the assassination of Egyptian President Anwar El-Sadate in "The Cairo Conspiracy", a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in "Panic in Bamako", he reported on the 4X4 columns of jihadists based in the Malian capital.
I am not a diviner, defended Gerard de Villiers, I am merely making assumptions from countries I know well, and from time to time some of my assumptions come true.
After these trips to often troubled areas, he settled for a month behind his 1976 IBM-style typewriter "whose parts were all changed".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page with the pen.
The walls of his office are lined with AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos, and photos of the author with African warlords.
Regularly branded for machismo by feminist leagues and for racism by human rights organizations, Gerard de Villiers dismissed these accusations in two sentences.
Some women are sexual objects in my books but others are beautiful, intelligent and brave women.
I am still very welcome in Africa, where I have a very large readership.
Gerard de Villiers said it well, "Malko Linge, like all heroes, is not old".
He's not going to die and retire.
Not as much as I do.
Airmen argue about the width of seats while big orders are at stake
The dispute rages among major aircraft manufacturers over the width of the tourist class seats on long-haul flights, paving the way for bitter confrontation at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute concerns the width of seats offered on long-haul flights to economy class passengers  who are not always the most sought after by airlines but to whom the allocated space is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week Airbus called on the aviation industry to set a standard imposing a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in the economy classes, but its major US rival Boeing says it should be up to airlines to decide.
The dispute erupted as airlines sought to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, hoping to eventually record orders at the event, which will take place from November 17-21.
The way the seats will be arranged at the rear of the aircraft  in particular, whether there will be 9 or 10 front seats  is essential for the economic performance of the  mini jumbo segment .
Boeing says its redesigned 777X will be able to seat 406 people in economy class in seats over 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus states that the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economy class in 18-inch-wide seats configured in rows of 9.
Aviation giants often exchange ideas on technical issues by advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus is calling directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Air Show, where the 777X is expected to take the lead over its competitors with more than 100 orders.
We could see recently what could be the start of a new advertising war with the presentation to the financiers of a photo showing three people fighting each other at the restaurant, entitled  Would you accept this? 
 Boeing offers long-haul flights in narrower seats than regional turboprop aircraft , said John Leahy, Airbus' chief commercial officer.
As dietary habits change, people get older, but seats on planes have not changed dramatically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing's 747 jumbo set the standard for modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the average American between the ages of 40 and 49's weight increased by 10 percent, according to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services data.
The average American in the 21st century is 39.7 inches tall, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rival is holding onto a seat concept dating back to the 1950s, when the aircraft's newly named  jet set  was narrower in circumference.
Airbus adds that it has ordered a study that indicates that an extra inch in seat width would improve sleep quality by 53%.
Boeing disputes Airbus' figures regarding seat width and claims that it is not for manufacturers to decide how airlines balance ticket prices and equipment.
He also says the study shows that cabin experience is not just about the width of the seats.
 It's really about giving airlines flexibility and allowing them to do what they think they need to do to get things done  said Kent Craver, Boeing's passenger satisfaction manager.
They don't want to be told what will make them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it is more about having some freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it is increasingly a question that could affect their results.
The dispute is a race to order aircraft for an estimated market price of at least $700 billion over the coming decades, enough to tip the balance of US and European exports.
As Reuters first reported in July, the configuration of the seats is exactly what fuels the battle between the latest aircraft.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim a performance per seat in their latest long-range twin-engine models 20% higher than that of the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeing's announced performance is partly based on the comparison between the 10-seat configured 777X and the original 9-seat configured 777X.
The unit cost gain is low compared to the currently in service 10 seats per row configured aircraft.
 Boeing is doing this to accommodate more seats and make its aircraft more competitive in relation to our products  said Kevin Keniston, Director of Comfort Passenger at European aircraft operator Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the existing 777 suggest that many passengers are in favour of a denser configuration, which can go hand in hand with cheaper fares.
 An 18-inch seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial perspective, Airbus' proposal is driven by the 777 threat, said cabin interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor-in-chief of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers for airlines to choose from.
Aircraft vendors traveling the world even carry a meter to check the competing configurations.
While all manufacturers are keen to offer comfortable aircraft, they also offer high-density aircraft to low-cost airlines and regional travel.
Airbus offers an A350 configured with 10 seats per row but says it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for greater cabin customization by offering wider side-of-the-way seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of large modern aircraft, experts say it is unlikely that its call to the aviation industry to set a size standard for seats will be successful, but it could lead to the 777X's sales surge being forgotten.
Oracle shareholders angry at Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted against the proposal to pay founder and CEO Larry Ellison on Thursday, given the financial performance of his group.
The vote is not binding but it is tarnishing the image of Larry Ellison, the world's third-richest man who just cheered his boat's victory at the America's Cup.
The billionaire still owns 25% of the software group he co-founded 40 years ago.
Last year, Ellison was voted down on his salary.
The Oracle boss waived a $1.2 million bonus for the 2013 fiscal year that closed in May due to poor performance of the group, which missed its growth targets, but it raised about $77 million related to stock options.
His fixed salary is only a symbolic dollar.
Over the entire postponed financial year 2013, Oracle's net profit increased by 3.5% while the stock price surged by 27.5%, outperforming the S&P-500 index which took 24% over the same period.
The new nicotine vaccine could suppress the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed a nicotine-resistant vaccine that could suppress the pleasure of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.
Further tests are needed before human trials begin, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first signs were encouraging.
 We really hope that this kind of vaccine strategy will help millions of smokers who have tried to quit, exhausting all the methods available on the market today, but find that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches , said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to carry the genetic information needed to design nicotine-resistant antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begin to produce a regular flow of antibodies.
The antibodies track all the nicotine molecules in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting his dose of nicotine.
During the tests, the vaccinated mice who were then given nicotine continued their normal activity.
But the mice that had not been vaccinated were calmed down, the researchers said, a sign that nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous vaccines against tobacco use have proven ineffective because they contained antibodies.
Injections had to be repeated so frequently that antibody levels remained high that they were too expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it turns liver cells into antibody plants.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any nicotine addiction.
But it's more likely to be used by smokers who want to quit.
 They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and this may help them to lose their bad habit , he added.
British scientists said the results were interesting but noted that much more research was needed.
Pakistani Taliban leader killed by drone
Pakistan's Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a US drone strike on Friday in Pakistan, security officials said.
The death of Hakimullah Mehsud has been announced several times in the past.
But intelligence officials, the army and the activist movement claimed that he had lost his life in the strike in the North Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone strike", a senior security official said.
The day before, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on a visit to London, informed the British government that talks had been initiated with Tehrik e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former New South Wales Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be the subject of an investigation by the state's anti-corruption regulator.
Former New South Wales Minister Joe Tripodi denied changing the trade lease policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties located in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation into whether Mr Obeid had pressured several ministers of state to renew his leases in Circular Quay, where the Obeids own two restaurants and a cafe, after they expired in August 2005, without a tender.
She is now investigating allegations that Mr Tripodi was aware of Mr Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following testimony from Mr Tripodi's former deputy secretary general, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.
During the years of negotiations that began in 2005, the government has been pushing for tenders to be tendered.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer periods.
In 2009, leases for Circular Quay companies, which brought in around $2.5 million a year to Obeid, were renewed without a tender.
Mr Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially favourable to the calls for tenders.
But he denied having changed his policy at the request of Mr Obeid who, Mr Tripodi acknowledged, called for a change in government policy on leases.
The transcript of telephone conversations submitted to the ICAC showed calls made in August and September 2007 between Mr Obeid, Mr Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Ministry of Ports after working under Mr Obeid at the Ministry of Fisheries.
 Was the development of the policy on trade leases the subject of discussion during these telephone conversations? , asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy to Mr Tripodi.
 No , Mr Tripodi replied.
I don't remember what we talked about, but that's not what it was.
At least not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes targeting Syria, official says
Israeli warplanes hit a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, a military official confirmed to Fox News.
The official didn't say what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has carried out air strikes on missile cargoes in Syria.
Foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa may have to pass a test  authenticity 
The Government is currently considering the possibility of introducing an authenticity test for foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa as it considers expanding the repression measures.
The test, if passed, would be applied according to a criterion designed to prevent 457 visas from being used for unqualified positions or as a diversionary way to bring family and friends to Australia.
A government working paper was unveiled today as Labour MP Maxine McKew denounced the government's speech on foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia's neighbors.
 The failed statements about 'foreigners coming back to the bottom of the line' and 'employment for Australians first' are a nasty return to the time when unions were demanding a protected labour market , she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white people's work was to be protected  and I would not be surprised if some countries in the region saw it as an echo of this historical artifact.
The working paper lists the 12 measures previously envisaged by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet with senior officials to discuss human trafficking, implemented five of the recommended changes, while the others are under review.
If the  authenticity criterion  were adopted, a visa applicant could be checked for  authenticity of the job offer in the case where the applicant is a relation or personal associate of the owner or the person concerned within the sponsor company .
Companies could also be required to report the number of visa holders 457 after some of them, intending to sponsor a small number of workers, actually employed hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker is reported to have died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The man's horrified 9-year-old son was travelling with him to Australia and has found some comfort since his father died Wednesday with an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was rushed by Australian authorities to the Christmas Island hospital, where he died.
A study to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland has been launched by the UK Government.
The work carried out by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and the north of England will start as soon as Phase 1 opens in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project would bring the UK together.
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was excited to work with the UK government on the project.
Phase 1 will lead to a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June the government raised the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and the north of England from £32.7 million to £42.6 million.
The UK Government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to study building railway capacity and improving the length of journeys to the north of England and Scotland.
This must include the possibility of travel times between Glasgow and Edinburgh of up to three hours.
Baroness Kramer said:  Our aim for HS2 is a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together. 
We are pushing the HS2 project because the benefits it brings are enormous.
Without it, we are facing a capacity problem of our railway network.
But it is also about developing connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that connectivity between them is improved through HS2.
The British Secretary of State for Scotland, Alistair Carmichael, added:  Today's announcement is good news for Scotland. 
For the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to support unequivocally the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said:  Highspeed rail has the potential to offer considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings Scotland's economic weight into the overall highspeed rail network project across Britain.
 We are therefore excited to work with the UK Government to explore options for bringing the high-speed rail network to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and completing the Glasgow-Edimbourg line that the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to reading the review report with the British ministers next year and then we will decide together on the next steps.
Rules for the use of electronic devices on board remain in force in Australia
Australian air passengers will continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during takeoff and landing despite the US move to relax regulations on electronic devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open for US carriers to change their procedures so passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their aircraft during critical flight phases provided they are in  plane  mode.
Passengers can already do this during most of the flight, but many people find it difficult not to access their e-books during takeoff and landing.
The Australian carriers are reviewing the decision requiring US carriers to do important work to comply with the requirements, but have indicated that they have no immediate intention to change their procedures.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was reviewing the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in place in Australia.
 CASA has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in airplanes , it said.
The issue is governed by regulations requiring aircraft operators to ensure continuous safety and passengers to comply with safety guidelines given by crew members.
Virgin, which has already told CASA of its intention to expand the use of its onboard entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to a change, but said it would follow the regulator.
 We would welcome a revision of CASA that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really believe that it would improve the customer experience now that we have (onboard entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology) on our planes , a spokesman said.
Qantas said it was complying with the current rules for the time being.
 According to our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during takeoff and landing, and we have no immediate intention of changing this , she said.
The FAA's decision applies to US airlines.
However, we are still interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will take a closer look at the FAA's decision and its reasons.
For US carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as review manuals, training equipment, hand luggage transport programmes and passenger instructions.
 Once an airline has verified the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use lightweight portable electronic devices, such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all altitudes , the FAA said.
In the rare cases of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to turn off their devices during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier aircraft be safely placed under the seats or in the upper compartments during take-off and landing.
Pia: At least four injured in a violent fight
The small town of Pia experienced an unusual fever Thursday night.
Three police vehicles, two ambulances and a crowd of about 30 people, according to the testimony collected...
On this Halloween night, the party was stirred up on the Pia side where a quarrel involving several people broke out on the Post Office side.
At least four minor injuries are unfortunate.
The police were alerted and went to the scene to separate the warring parties and to ensure that the wounded were taken care of.
Singaporean mortgage lenders take advantage of the middle classes forced to tighten their belts
At a pawnshop in Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga deposits a bracelet, ring and pair of gold earrings to pay for her daughters' schooling.
 My husband and I just bought a house so all my money went into it , says Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 a month from Singapore as an administrator and her husband works as well, the monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, demand is so high in parts of Southeast Asia  where household debt is increasing  that ValueMax, where it made its transaction, became this week the third mortgage company to be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Getting jewelry on the mortgage is not only a quick way to get Singapore's  1,300 dollars in cash in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga  but it is almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In general, Singapore's mortgage lenders charge an annual effective interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, mortgage lenders have the advantage of not requiring credit checks or proof of salary, and can unlock loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region are turning to mortgage lenders as families feel the pressure of rising living costs and overindebted households and consumers.
After five years of solid growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fueled by too lax monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to mortgage lenders to fill the gap as their economies slow.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's cited rising household debt, mainly due to rising mortgage loans, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
It said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt to gross domestic product ratio in Asia.
Malaysia tops the list with 80% of GDP, up from 60% in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has emerged this week from a technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed a continuing weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
 The bottom line is that as costs rise, middle and low-income people are looking to supplement their income as much as they can , says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
The historically high prices of gold over the past two years have prompted people to rush to pledge their personal belongings to get the cash value of their jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the items pawned in the 200 pawn shops in the city-state are gold.
People say, "The price of gold is high, let's pawn the grandmother's gold chain and come back next month to get it".
In Thailand, the largest operator of mortgage shops, EasyMoney, has seen a 20% increase in the number of customers using its shops in recent months.
The growth in the mortgage lending sector is such that ValueMax, which operates the store in Bendemeer and 15 other shops like it in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia, where it already has four stores, but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, its CEO.
The company will fund them using 60 percent of the $66 million in Singapore it raised this week when it went public.
While some low-interest lenders have been criticized for their exorbitant interest rates, Ms Yeah says that pledging not only offers lower rates than other lenders but also does not directly increase debt.
 Customers mortgage property they already own, and monetizing their personal property does not increase household debt , she says.
The social acceptance of mortgage as a means of obtaining guaranteed financing in the short term is increasing.
Also, people who go to mortgage lenders are not the only ones who have financial problems.
Rich people in Singapore also go to ValueMax mortgage stores to pawn gold bullion or Rolex watches, which can account for up to 60 percent of their cash purchase price.
We see clients from all walks of life.
 It can be wealthy people who need to borrow short-term for business or investment activities, or small businesses who need cash to make a difficult move , adds Ms Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pastor accused of child pornography in Nova Scotia
A youth minister in the Halifax area of Nova Scotia is accused of child pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, 30, was arrested Friday morning following raids on his home and the National Research Council office where he works.
The Baptist church in Timberlay, where the pastor served, expressed deep sorrow at the news.
In a statement, church officials said Mr. Hudgins resigned from his position.
The pastor was released on parole.
The child must not communicate with persons under 18 years of age and must not access the Internet.
He's due to appear in provincial court in Halifax in December.
He goes to the supermarket in Nazi uniform before he gets kicked out.
A man in a Nazi uniform with a bracelet with a spider's cross was ordered to leave an English supermarket, customers complained to the head of the establishment who called the police, the store said Friday.
"We received several complaints from customers, so we asked him to leave the store", explained a spokeswoman for the supermarket chain Asda.
The store called the police to rescue, but "by the time she arrived, he had already left without a scandal", she added.
I was in line when I saw a woman who seemed upset.
People were upset.
"You don't go out like this unless you want to get attention", said a customer, Rosina Rusin, 60, to the Cambridge News.
The incident happened on Thursday, the day of Halloween, when it is customary to disguise oneself as a monster, but it was difficult to tell if it was a hoax.
A man from Cambridge claimed responsibility for the attack on his Twitter account, where he posted images of Adolf Hitler.
"I have been wearing an SS black bracelet twice a week for three years at Asda", said Paul Dutton, who described himself as having "mental problems".
A $325 million bailout for the Tasmanian health system
The federal government maintains that the $325 million bailout for the vacant health system comes with strict conditions to ensure that the state government will not waste the funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is currently taking urgent measures to end a crisis caused by the island state's aging population, high rates of chronic disease and systemic constraints.
The funding, planned for four years, was decided after consultations with the government and independent member of parliament for Tasmania, Andrew Wilkie.
 The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan which we believe will address the unique difficulties facing the state , Ms Plibersek said today.
The $325 million plan includes a $31 million campaign for non-urgent surgical operations.
2,600 additional operations, including orthopedic and cataract surgery, will help to catch up.
Funding is also provided for the appointment-free clinics in Hobart and Launceston, improved external care, training of medical staff, mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical record systems in local hospitals.
 These investments are in line with the idea that, according to frontline clinicians, this is the best way to treat Tasmania's healthcare system, said Ms Plibersek.
The Minister said that the Tasmanian Government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The State will have to maintain the current funding levels in order to receive Commonwealth money and prepare monthly reports on the sectors where it spends the additional funds.
A three-person committee will be set up to ensure that the State provides services in the most efficient and efficient way possible.
Mr Wilkie said today that the $325 million will be little unless it is followed by real reforms to strengthen Tasmania's public health system.
He nevertheless commended the government for responding to the urgent request for assistance he submitted to the Prime Minister in early May.
 I hope that the federal aid plan will make a big contribution to removing the public health system in Tasmania from the blacklist , said Mr Wilkie.
According to the State Government, these additional non-urgent procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts.
But opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton thinks today's announcement is a  a fortune solution .
 The reason we're here is that the state's Labour government has withdrawn $430 million from its healthcare system , he told ABC TV.
You can't have a state government that takes out almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth that puts in $300 million, and pretend it's a day of glory.
Mr Dutton visited Mrs Plibersek to ensure that no dollar of the bailout plan would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The adaptation by Guillaume Nicloux of Denis Diderot's novel boasts of remarkable artistic direction and a meticulous reconstruction of the time, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
Set in France in the 1760s, it tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she faces the unlimited cruelty of a deliberately sadistic Mother Superior and becomes the object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never gets lubricated or sensational, and that's the problem.
The conscientious solemnity of the narrative could also become a penance for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons production capacity, says the monitoring body
Syria destroyed equipment essential to the production of chemical weapons and ammunition filled with toxic gases, the International Chemical Weapons Monitoring Agency said Thursday, as violent clashes raged in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored.
A group of Syrian activists also said on Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the civil war began in the country nearly three years ago.
The announcement by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came a day ahead of the deadline for the
The Hague-based organisation ordered Damascus to destroy or render useless all chemical weapons production units and machinery for mixing toxic gases and filling ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial destruction phase is an important step in the ambitious timetable to destroy Damascus' chemical weapons by mid-2014.
With the destruction of the equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus, however, has yet to begin destroying its existing weapons and reserves.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 tons of chemical products and weapons, including mustard gas and the neurotoxic agent sarin.
The announcement came as fighting raged on Thursday in the town of Safira, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons production unit and storage sites, reported the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
The group, which tracks human progress through a network of activists based in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, an estimated 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
The government estimates that 29,954 members of President Bashar al-Assad's armed forces have been killed, including 18,678 pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Among the dead, an estimated 2,202 were deserters and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated that 100,000 people have died in the conflict since March 2011.
She hasn't updated that number since.
Some 2 million people have been forced to flee the country because of the conflict.
Al-Assad's troops have been fighting the rebels, many of whom are linked to al-Qaeda networks, in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory said Thursday that there were casualties on both sides, but gave no details.
The fighting highlighted the importance of the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors as they complete their mission to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal amid a long-running civil war, within a short time.
A statement from the OPCW, which works closely with the UN, said its team was now satisfied that all critical production declared and mixing and filling machines had been controlled and destroyed.
It added that no further inspection activity was planned at the moment.
Earlier this week, the inspectors said they had completed the first phase of the verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites reported by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the last two sites due to safety concerns, inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW said that both sites were, according to Syria,  abandoned and... that elements of the chemical weapons program they contained had been moved to other reported sites, which were inspected .
It was difficult to know at first glance whether the Safira unit was one of the two sites that the OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons which was approved the following month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
 I welcome the moral strength and courage you all have shown in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organisation , said the organisation's Director-General Ahmet Uzumcu in a commentary published by the OPCW.
Now in its third year, the civil war is mainly between Sunni Muslim rebels against the Assad government and its security forces, who are supported by members of the Alawite sect, a branch of Shiite Islam.
On the other hand, the director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said there was a strong explosion on Wednesday at an air defense base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Anger at the sentence of one of the Bali bomb planners
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombings reacted angrily to the sentence of the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek should be shot by a firing squad.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted men, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in the manufacture of the explosive devices used in the bombings.
He could be released after 15 years on parole.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder in the attacks on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured many others.
He was also convicted of numerous other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of church bombings throughout Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors have asked for a life sentence, but they could have asked for the man, dubbed  Demolition Man  for his reputation as an expert in bomb making, to be sentenced to death.
The decision brought back painful memories for June Corteen, a Perth-based mother who lost her twin sisters, Jane and Jenny, aged 39, to the destruction perpetrated by Patek and the other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
She said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as the other men.
 He should be dragged before the execution squad , Ms Corteen told the AAP.
I have to live every day without having any more grandchildren or seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded into a van parked outside, exploded just after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a suicide bomber blew up a bag full of explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He fell into a coma the day after the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and he died three times while under respiratory assistance.
Mr. Hugues said Patek should have suffered the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell of Jemaah Islamiyah responsible for the killing of  Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra  who were executed 4 years ago.
In fact, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
Keep him alive, why, there's no reason to keep him alive.
Spending 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds of others is not much.
Patek is the last of Bali's bombers to be brought to justice.
He had managed to avoid capture for nearly 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces would kill former Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent said that intelligence reports revealed Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in order to reestablish links between the Southeast Asian terrorist groups and Al-Qaeda.
 He did not surrender , Mrs Corteen added.
Until recently, he was a derisive scoff at the pain he had caused others.
The verdict was handed down on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks, which will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
There will be a lot of crying this year, Ms. Corteen said.
Patek, however, can appeal his conviction.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on board planes (but not make a phone call with their mobile phone)
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices door-to-door to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music  but not talk on their mobile phones  under the highly anticipated new guidelines released Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed at which the change will be implemented will vary from airline to airline, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
Airlines will have to prove to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated crew training manuals and aircraft storage rules to be in compliance.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans.
 Depending on the plan, we could approve widespread use of electronic devices very soon , the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the doors of the aircraft are closed.
They're not supposed to turn them on again until the plane reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the commander gives his green light.
Passengers are supposed to turn off their devices when the aircraft descends before landing and not turn them on again until the aircraft has landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their aircraft during takeoffs, landings and ground rolling, the FAA said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft which have been modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, expressed her happiness over the changes.
 Once the new policy is implemented safely  and we will work closely with carriers to do this  it will be beneficial to everyone , Glading explained in a statement.
We're frankly tired of feeling like roommates when it comes to this.
But it will still be forbidden to connect to the Internet to surf, exchange emails and text messages or download data below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices on air.
So still not Words With Friends, the online game of Scrabble style that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he was loudly kicked out of an American Airlines plane after refusing to turn off his device while it was parked at the door.
And heavier devices like laptops will always have to be stored because they could hurt someone if they were to fly through the cabin.
Mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory power for mobile phones is the Federal Communications Commission and not the FAA.
The FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, national transportation safety expert at CBS News, said that cell phones were still considered a risk.
 Mobile phones are a real problem, not only because they could potentially create interference with navigation instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could disrupt mobile phone radio antennas if used on board , Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to look into the issue last month recommended that the government allow for wider use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on the FAA has increased in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., argue that there is no valid security reason for these bans.
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce as the use of devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies indicate that at least one third of passengers forget to turn off their appliances, or do so deliberately.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports of interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers carried FM radios, the high-tech gadget of the time.
The new airliners rely much more on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand electronic interference and are FAA-approved.
Airlines have been allowing passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruise altitudes for several years.
Airplanes modified to accommodate Wi-Fi systems also resist interference better.
The vast majority of airlines should allow for wider use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit much lower radio power than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, emit only minimal transmissions when a page is turned.
But the transmissions are stronger when the devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is among those pushing for easing restrictions on passenger use of electronic devices.
In 2011, the company's executives loaded a Kindle e-book reader jet and flew it to see if there were any problems, but there were none.
This has given mixed feelings to the members of the FAA Advisory Committee on whether or not the use of the devices presents a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believed the interference from aircraft was real, even though the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said that there were only anecdotal reports from pilots that the aircraft could interfere with aircraft systems, and that most of them were very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA authorise pilots to ask passengers to turn off their aircraft during instrument landings in low visibility conditions.
A group in the travel industry welcomed the changes, calling them sensible arrangements for tech-savvy travelers.
 We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with safety , said Roger Dow, President and Director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A helicopter-trailed North Sea bird released into the wild
A bird, helicoptered after being found exhausted on an oil rig in the North Sea, has been released into the wild.
The water runoff was flown on a helicopter to Aberdeen last month before being re-established by the Scottish SPCA at their Alloa rescue centre.
The centre's director, Colin Seddon, said:  This watershed was probably a winter migrant from northern Europe who was caught in the middle of violent winds in the North Sea. 
It seems that the exhausted bird has managed to find shelter on the oil platform.
He added:  He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted to help. 
The water rattle was healthy when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise of bringing businesses together and defining what wealth and job creators want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
To do this, we have commissioned the broadest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain, businesses and the EU.
YouGov surveyed over 1,000 business leaders, representing all sizes of businesses, sectors and regions across the UK.
The findings of the investigation will come as a surprise to many.
We found that the vast majority of companies are now looking to export outside Europe, focusing on developing and modernizing countries while EU countries are stagnating.
They want the government to give priority to new trade links with countries like China, India and Brazil rather than get caught up in the long and arduous process of reforming European institutional arcana.
When asked for their opinion on specific policy points  ranging from monopoly regulation to product laws  most business leaders believe that control of these key competences should return to Westminster.
The single market has generated general discontent, with companies saying that the cost of the Brussels Regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of being part of the European trade area. 40% of large companies, traditionally the most pro-European, even agree.
Finally, and even more importantly, our survey of business leaders revealed that a large majority wanted Britain to continue initiatives for a change in the Treaty and the development of a relationship with the EU based on trade rather than politics.
This finding, which is found in all large groups and companies of all sizes, shows that the business world is insisting on a significant change that will restore power to the UK.
The stakes are high  succeeding in changing the treaty and better representing Britain's interests would see a 16% swing in favour of the country remaining in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not doubt for a moment: this survey shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain's EU accession.
It also shows that companies hope that renegotiation will constitute a significant shift in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the UK.
It is possible and increasingly necessary to better represent the interests of British businesses as the euro area moves towards closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be employment and growth in Britain and, as the findings of our survey show, for businesses this means re-emphasising trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach in Brussels.
The United States in the colors of Halloween
In the United States, President Obama has not departed from the tradition of Halloween.
He and his wife last night distributed sweets to hundreds of invited children in the gardens of the White House in Washington.
Last year, Halloween celebrations on the U.S. East Coast were canceled because of Hurricane Sandy.
So this year, the party people caught up.
In New York City, thousands of people dressed up took part in the parade held in the Greenwich Village neighborhood.
Everyone is over-excited, says one of the participants, Andrea.
I finally got to wear the suit I planned for last year.
We're having fun like crazy, Rhonda adds.
People are happy.
He's a good kid, he's cool.
We really need this.
Halloween is a pagan holiday celebrated on the eve of All Saints' Day, mainly in Anglo-Saxon countries.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom says the Bulgarian pipeline opens a new era of gas
The start of construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, said Gazprom's managing director.
 A historic event took place today: Construction began on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, Europe's largest large-scale project , said Alexei Miller, Gazprom's CEO, in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the whole European continent.
South Stream should diversify the export routes from Russia to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its Ukrainian counterpart, through which most of the Russian gas is transported to Europe, increases the level of risk compared to conventional routes, the director adds.
Miller added that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated  forever .
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project is put into service in 2015.
Gazprom said construction would begin in other countries downstream by the end of the year.
The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest marine reserve
The island of Pitcairn is aiming to create the world's largest marine reserve, Tahiti News reported Thursday, quoting a Radio Australia report.
This island, east of the Gambier Archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory in the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This area is 47 km2 if you count three other small islands nearby.
It has been British since its occupation in 1790 by the Bounty mutineers, an episode in the history of the English Navy that resulted in three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozen residents, mostly descendants of the Bounty mutineers, still live in Pitcairn, and their incomes depend on 95% of London's generosity.
The island council voted unanimously in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, which is 836,000 km2 and corresponds to its exclusive economic zone.
A deputy mayor of the island went to London to ask Britain to validate the request.
Pitcairn Mayor Mike Warren believes that creating such a protected area would be the first step towards greater financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be approved by the British Governor of Pitcairn, who resides in New Zealand, and the British Government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to sanctuary these 836,000 km2 provided that it has the means to monitor them, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, making it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to surveillance of the area, and there is no port to place military surveillance ships.
France has already to carry out the very expensive air and sea surveillance of the five million km2 of the French Polynesian EEZ, near Pitcairn.
The FAA is relaxing restrictions on the use of electronic gadgets on board aircraft  but it will still be prohibited to make calls on mobile phones.

Former Chinese vice-governor sentenced to life in prison
A former vice governor of China's northeastern Jilin province was sentenced to life in prison on Friday for corruption.
Excluded from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of taking more than 19 million yuan in bribes, official Chinese media reported.
Between 1995 and 2001, the deputy governor, who was also the president of the Jilin Bank, a public institution, helped businesses and officials obtain contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, the first intermediate court in Beijing said on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, made fighting corruption a national priority, believing that the phenomenon posed a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party.
While the head of state promised that justice would be as unassailable to powerful "tigers" as it is to "flies" - the junior civil servants - only a handful of high-ranking officials, including former executives of oil giant Petrochina, were convicted.
The most recent case was that of former CCP leader in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, who was sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after holding the highest office in the state.
But the government has not shown any intention to reform the anti-corruption system by, for example, creating an independent party body.
Two YMCA employees charged with sexual assault following allegations made against Jonathan Lord at a Royal Commission hearing.
Two New South Wales YMCA employees were charged with sexual assault against children following allegations made against Caringbah's teacher Jonathan Lord in 2011 during a Royal Commission into Child Sexual Abuse hearing.
But in its opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA said that it had never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within its organisation.
Director-General Phillip Hare was questioned in two cases: an employee of the YMCA was charged with child pornography offences and a physical education monitor at the YMCA Caringbah Hall was found guilty of sexual assault on children at the centre where he worked in 1991.
Mr Hare told Gail Furness, counsellor at the Commission, that he was aware of the first case but was not aware of the second.
He also acknowledged that the opening statement of the YMCA was inaccurate, stressing that external controls of the YMCA were carried out and indicated that the safety of children was an absolute priority for the organisation.
It was demonstrated to the Commission that the YMCA was informed that it had received the second worst ratings out of four institutions during a quality audit by the Department of Education and Communities in August this year.
Mr Hare, who started working at the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that staff management was a failure with Lord's recruitment and that he failed to verify that employees knew they were required to report any violations of the child safety policy.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexually assaulting 12 boys during his two years at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of six years in prison.
But Mr Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's failures in child safety.
The staff members testified that they had noticed some shortcomings, including Lord being alone with the children, keeping them in private, making them sit on his knees, telling them he loved them, and letting them play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was mentored by Lord and had requested child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior, said she found the head of child services at YMCA Caringbah, Jacqui Barnat, who mentored Lord  very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time .
The director general said he rejected the staff's testimony that they were reluctant to report these shortcomings to their top management.
Instead, he said that their friendly relationship with Lord had clouded their judgment, so they did not report his actions.
Mr Hare said he had expressed his view before the New South Wales YMCA Council saying that for the organisation the lesson from the Jonathan Lord incident should not be about the reporting by staff, and the Council agreed with him.
Mr Hare said the decision to have the staff sign the confidentiality agreements shortly after the allegations were made was made by the YMCA's Director General for Children's Services, Liam Whitley.
He stated that the decision was intended to avoid any contamination of the evidence but that it was an excess of zeal and that it had been misapplied.
The New South Wales YMCA was not a safe organisation for children at the time Jonathan Lord was employed there, between 2009 and 2011, said the expert on child sexual violence, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, before the Commission.
He pointed out that there were serious problems in recruitment, control, initiation, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing has been postponed until December 20.
Tony Blair has said he would seize the opportunity to become prime minister again, but acknowledges that his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the fifth anniversary of his departure at the end of his term, the 59-year-old expressed his views on various national policies.
Since leaving in June 2007 after a decade at the helm of the country, Mr Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as the Quartet's special envoy for the Middle East peace process.
When asked if he would like to return to the post of Prime Minister, Mr Blair reportedly replied, according to the London Evening Standard:  Yes, of course, but it may be likely that it will happen, so...
When many equestrian experts gathered in Cardiff to compete and win the Horse of the Year trophy, they knew the competition would be tough.
But no one expected Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old, to win.
Not yet in school and only a few months after making his first weapons, the toddler and his Shetland Toffee pony skated through the three laps with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind the other 30 adult competitors.
The two inseparable  who are of the same size  were lauded for their presentation, attitude and style at the annual competition held at the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre, in Rudry near Cardiff.
Standing up to men and women in elegant melon hats, he wore his flat cap a little on the side in a relaxed manner to roll his 2-year-old Toffee pony around the track.
Fenton was praised by the judges for his natural training qualities unusual for a child his age.
And Toffee got very good grades for his presentation and personality.
Fenton got Toffee as a gift for his third birthday last March and has been training with his Shetland pony every day since.
His mother Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and Toffee are a great duo.
They were against everyone, but they both had the gold cup and the rosette.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffee and we were so happy he won.
On the track, people who didn't know him thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
This young boy from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been involved in horse racing for over 10 years.
Mrs Howells said:  There was electricity in the air and everyone was cheering and applauding her. 
He ran all the way down the track and even though he seemed a little small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy about animals. He loves horses, tractors, the country, and he has two chickens to take care of.
The way he started, he'll probably be participating in the Horse of the Year event soon and I'm sure he'll make a good performance.
A spokesman for the annual equestrian event said:  Fenton is only 3 years old but he knows how to drive his pony. 
They're a good team.
The judges noticed that Fenton and Toffee performed well and the way they paraded on the track.
They're looking for an effective teamwork between the pony and the trainer. Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his pretty clothes helped Fenton, he looked really proud.
A Chinese newspaper that made a call will be re-edited
A Chinese newspaper that has made a front-page appeal for the release of a journalist accused of defamation will be reversed, says a press regulator.
The Guangzhou-based New Express has issued a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to fabricate stories about a semi-public company.
Now the New Express will undergo a complete overhaul, the regulator said.
The order for the re-design is issued by the Guangdon Administration for Press and Publishing, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, owned by Yangcheng Evening News, published several erroneous articles about the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
 The New Express editorial staff was disorganized , the regulator said in a statement.
He said he had decided to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou by withdrawing his press card.
He also ordered the Yangcheng Evening News Group to undertake a complete overhaul of New Express, and recommended that it investigate the people responsible for New Express and immediately overhaul the management team of the newspaper.
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express about alleged financial irregularities from a construction equipment manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper twice published a first-page appeal for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen later appeared on a public television channel where he admitted to publishing fake stories for money.
 In this case, I have hurt Zoomlion and the media industry and its ability to gain public trust , he told the public television network CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was chasing money and fame.
I realized I was wrong.
Following Mr. Chen's apology, New Express published its apology on the front page, writing that it had not properly checked its articles.
Several of the most prominent suspects recently made televised confessions.
Experts say people are systematically forced to confess, despite a change in the law that was passed earlier this year banning authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.
The aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle is "unavailable"
In Toulon, the aircraft carrier is on the brink.
The radioactive steam leak detected from one of the two nuclear power plants at Charles de Gaulle in mid-October and while the ship was at sea was "safe for sailors", but not without consequences for the Navy.
The Royal Navy has just confirmed that the ship is "unavailable" until "mid-November", "time to take the necessary corrective measures" on the reactor.
For its part, the naval defence specialist DCNS says that its and Areva's teams, sent to the Var for the occasion, are "currently interviewing the aircraft carrier".
They are concerned, among other things, with replacing a pump on the failed heater.
"Everything is being done to ensure that the Charles-de-Gaulle can make its planned deployment by the end of 2013", DCNS explains, however.
And the National Navy to certify that "it does not in any way question the programme of activity of the ship" with nuclear propulsion.
The aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle is now out of a six-month interim maintenance period.
He had arrived from Toulon in mid-October for training.
This is particularly the case for training young fighter pilots.
A "small breakdown", confined to the reactor confinement area, had occurred on the French Navy's flagship.
According to the National Navy, the crew had not been exposed to any possible radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, everywhere I have been able to see a great deal of discontent from the people I meet: a monstrous revaluation of their property, a flood of taxes, the cost of all kinds of permits, endless administrative costs.
In short, we're getting a whole lot of pockets.
Millions of dollars in waste could be saved to allow for a very respectful taxation of those who pay.
Any money forcibly taken from taxpayers reduces their freedom to consume and contributes to their impoverishment.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major businesses, there is no problem with the sumptuary expenditure and maintenance of crippled ducks: a cultural centre in deficit, a large subsidy to the City of Energy, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, sell them to the private company or demolish them.
It is also regrettable to see the expropriation of several properties to accommodate a major industry that has never come.
I do however make an honourable mention of the transformation of the old Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator, but at what cost to taxpayers?
It is not the public sector that should invest in such enterprises, but the private sector based on consumer demand.
Citizens were pleased to learn that the Fisheries and Battery lakes will continue to supply the city with clean drinking water.
As a result of the withdrawal of all industries (large water users) and the great decline in population, water use has decreased considerably throughout the territory.
Without wasting it, the city will never run out of water and the strict regulations on its use could be greatly relaxed.
In short, it's easy to achieve great things with other people's money.
I'd be ashamed to defend such a record.
With a gross debt of over $200 million, this city can no longer afford to buy a pen without going through a loan settlement.
We've been run for over 40 years by tie-breeders with pretty good degrees for the most part and I don't think a sheep farmer would do any worse.
A drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railroad was discovered
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electrical rail systems, has been discovered.
U.S. officials have described the four foot by three tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passageways they've ever seen.
The zigzag tunnel, about six football fields long, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, to San Diego, U.S.A.
The area is full of indefinable warehouses, which makes it easy to hide drug-laden trucks.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs came out unnoticed, authorities said.
Authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the tunnel was discovered, according to court records.
Three men who, according to authorities, worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to sell.
They face a prison sentence of 10 years to life in prison if convicted.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers operate large underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passageway discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered following the harvest of marijuana in central Mexico in October, posing a challenge to drug cartels who must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a 700-yard railroad passage that ran from the kitchen of a Tijuana home to two warehouses in San Diego.
British police issue an extradition warrant against Assange
British police today issued an extradition warrant against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought political asylum at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London.
Scotland Yard said it had issued a release notice against the 40-year-old Australian, asking him to report to a police station, adding that if he did not, he would likely be arrested.
Assange could be extradited to Sweden following allegations of sexual offences, having exhausted all possible avenues under British law after the Supreme Court invalidated his appeal against his extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would allow his transfer to the United States, he sought refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on June 19, requesting political asylum from the South American country.
Scotland Yard has issued a release notice against a 40-year-old man who asks him to report to a police station on the date and time of his choice, a spokesman said.
He's still violating the terms of his bail.
The embassy declined to comment on the police's release of the notice.
Assange fears being extradited from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of espionage, after exposing more than 250,000 US diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks website fighting classified information.
How Biometrics Will Invade Our Lives
Did he run out of passwords to type in to access his smartphone or pay for his purchases?
American, French, or Japanese researchers predict a future where we'll be recognized by biometric sensors on phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, Deputy Director General of Morpho, even believes that "the century will be biometric".
Only biometrics will ensure the identity of a person conducting transactions in a transversal and transnational universe such as the Internet.
Privacy organizations confirm this enthusiasm for biometrics, but are concerned about it.
In 2011 alone and in France, the National Commission for Information and Freedom authorised 774 fingerprint recognition systems, hand shape or hand vein network in businesses, government departments, canteens...
"Everyone will soon be able to be identified, anywhere and anytime", says Justin Brookman, consumer privacy officer at the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), in Washington.
What are the reasons for such optimism in some and pessimism in others?
Biometrics will be based on new technologies, which will enable new services to be provided to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most widely used biometric data are fingerprints, the contour of the hand and the venous network of the palm or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its limitations.
"For example, some people who work on concrete have very damaged fingers and their fingerprints are unreadable", observes Philippe Robin, technical director of identity at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection and checking of the vein and the contour of the hand presuppose a voluntary and precise gesture of the person.
This is both a security - you cannot capture this data without them - and a disadvantage: the procedure sometimes has to be repeated and therefore takes time.
As a result, research has been conducted for some twenty years on other approaches, such as facial recognition or iris (the colored part of the eye).
The increased precision of sensors and the computational capacity of computers required for data analysis make these techniques operational.
Facial recognition accuracy has increased tenfold over the past five years, says Cyrille Bataller, Accenture's director of R&D laboratories in Europe.
With our help, the UK and Holland have deployed automatic border crossings using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a moving face or iris.
"Today we are doing research on voice recognition or walking using sound sensors, but we need a quiet environment", says Sridhar Iyengar, director of security research at Intel Labs.
DNA is a unique and unmistakable marker, and it also raises hopes and concerns.
"At the current level of knowledge, it can be considered as the ultimate biometric data", confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, Director of Studies, Innovation and Prospects at CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.
NEC offers the judicial police a suitcase of 90,000 euros to analyze DNA samples at the scene of a crime and within an hour.
The uses of biometrics fall into two groups: identification (recognition of a person among others) and authentication (ensuring that the person is who he claims to be).
Identification has hitherto been concerned with the issue of identity papers: biometric elements (fingerprints, photo, iris) must be compared with the information the State has on all citizens already registered.
This ensures that one person does not attempt to steal someone else's identity.
This comparison principle may have other applications.
NEC thus offers VIP recognition at the entrance of a hotel or shop.
"We take the images from the surveillance cameras and compare them to the photos of celebrities who are freely circulating on the Internet", explains Dany Nassif, head of commercial development for biometric identification solutions at NEC France.
Another use: to photograph a quidam queuing in a store, to track its progress by facial recognition and to calculate the waiting time.
Authentication was originally concerned with physical access (border, protected premises, canteens...) or logical access (opening a computer).
The presence control has been added to this recently.
"A biometric pointer avoids the phenomenon of a friend pointing for another", explains Cyrille Bataller of Accenture.
But increasingly, authentication will also involve transactions, especially those made from devices connected to the Internet.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from some distributors by introducing a card and placing your hand on a biometric reader.
A similar technique is being tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angoulême by Natural Security in partnership with banks and retailers: when paying in stores with their bank card, the customer does not type his code but inserts his finger into a vein-scanning reader.
The experiment is scheduled to last six months.
If it is conclusive, biometric readers could soon be available to French merchants.
Ways to reassure users
There are three ways to make biometrics appealing to the general public.
The first is to explain that it can save time.
"If, thanks to biometrics, a customer stays in the cash for 30 seconds less, it is appreciated", explains the manager of a large area.
The second is to offer personalized services: within a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you customized options.
And finally, reassure by highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases.
"Fingerprints are stored on a first server; people's identities are on a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure box, which locks if you try to move it", says Philippe Robin de Thales.
But because of the lack of detailed studies, it is impossible to know whether these speeches really convince users.
Privacy experts, on the other hand, continue to worry.
"The advances in facial recognition, the proliferation of surveillance cameras and the huge number of photos available on Facebook, Flickr and Picasa, make me fear the worst: widespread surveillance", predicts Andrew Patrick, of the Canadian Privacy Commissioner's Office.
A driver driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink between his legs was fined £1,000
A driver was fined £1,000 for driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink balanced between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, of Tiptree, Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree on 27 May.
When the police arrested him, they found the drink to be carried between his legs.
At the Colchester Court of First Instance, Howie admitted to the offence of driving without due care and attention.
The seven points withdrawn from his licence led to a six-month withdrawal.
Howie was also ordered to pay a fine of £90 and a surcharge of £100 per victim.
A tax on foreign property owners to blow up the London bubble
The Treasury has provisionally set the capital gains tax rate but is awaiting a final decision from Mr Osborne who, in the 2012 budget, has registered a 7% stamp duty on properties costing over £2m and an annual fee for buyers who choose to own properties as part of a corporation rather than as individuals.
The stamp duty already applies to residential properties in the boroughs of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, and represents £708 million in the 2012/13 financial year, which is more than the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North East, North West and Yorkshire and the Humber Region combined.
Mr Cook stated:  Following the increase in stamp duty on high value property and the introduction of the anti-avoidance law in this area, it is very difficult to argue that high value property is under-taxed regardless of the effects of the obsolete housing tax system. 
 But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in London or current owners reluctant to sell , he added.
The prestigious real estate market, which is 5 to 10% of the highest prices in the thriving sector in southwest London from Fulham to Wimbledon, rose by a record 11.8% last year.
Prices in central London are growing steadily year on year by 5.6%, but have been eclipsed by a growing domestic market, with the southwest, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) recovering, according to Savills' studies.
Scientists have just shed light on how a dog's tail movements are linked to his mood.
Previous studies have shown that happy dogs tend to move their tail more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs tend to move their tail more to the left.
But now scientists say that dogs can detect these subtle differences and respond to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said:  Everyone knows that in humans, the left and right sides of the brain are involved in different ways in the stimuli that arouse positive or negative emotions. 
Here we tried to see what was happening in other species.
He added that just as in humans, in dogs, the right side of the brain was responsible for left-hand movement and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs respond to the disordered tail movements of other dogs, researchers followed animals watching movies featuring other dogs.
They measured the animals' heart rate and analyzed their behavior.
It will probably be a while before we understand why their tail sometimes goes one way and sometimes the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained:  We showed dogs films with other dogs  either a naturalist version or a silhouette to avoid any other confusion  and we were able to manipulate the tail movement and present it as moving to the left or right. 
When the animals saw a dog without an expression move its tail to the right (from the dog's point of view), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they spotted a tail that was mostly turned left (again from the dog's point of view), their heart rate accelerated and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think that dogs communicated with each other deliberately through these movements.
Rather, he thinks dogs know by experience what movements they should or should not worry about.
He added:  If you meet other dogs repeatedly and notice that, most of the time, the tail movement to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will react according to that experience. 
The researchers say the findings could help owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand their pets' emotions.
Dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, a visiting professor at the University of Bristol's School of Veterinary Sciences, said that this was not the first study to examine the importance of left and right in canine species.
Last year, a team at Lincoln University found that dogs turned their heads to the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and to the right when it was a happy dog.
And in another scientific study by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said:  Dogs were more likely to go to a robot dog when its tail moved to the left rather than the right, instead of becoming anxious  the opposite of what the Italian study shows. 
He said the differences could be due to the fact that the dogs in the various studies did not fully consider the animals in the movies or the robot dogs as dogs.
He explained that a study of how dogs react to real dogs could be helpful.
 Although many evidence from different mammals indicates that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details are still to be clarified  and dogs are no exception , he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, it will likely take us a while to understand why their tail moves sometimes one way and sometimes the other.
Arctic Monkeys is back in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
The rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed a gig in Glasgow after their singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
The Sheffield band was scheduled to perform Friday at the Hydro concert hall in the city centre.
However, her larynx forced singer Alex Turner to reschedule the show.
The announcement came after the band was forced to postpone a concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said:  Following the decision to postpone the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and after requesting a medical opinion, the Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the show at the Glasgow Hydro on Friday 1 November. 
Alex Turner suffers from laryngitis and regrets not being able to perform.
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on 20 November and the show at the Hydro in Glasgow will take place on 21 November.
All tickets to these concerts remain valid.
We would like to apologize to all ticket holders for any inconvenience caused.
Please contact the customer service at the ticket office where you purchased your tickets for any further assistance.
Pope Francis will appoint his first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals for the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, the Vatican announced Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest ranking men in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who elevate him, so Francis will appoint his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, once a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope  so this amounts to a group of 120  cardinal electors .
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that a meeting of all the existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony during which bishops would be elevated to the dignity of cardinal, known as the consistory.
 Pope Francis decided to announce his decision to convene the February consistory in advance to facilitate planning for other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world  Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February the number of cardinals elected will likely have declined.
He said that a pope would usually appoint as many cardinals as needed to get the number of cardinals elected to 120 and as many cardinals over 80 as he wanted.
The consensus next year will be important because it will be the first since Pope Francis was elected in March this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a kind of tendency to favour Europe and Italy in particular.
 It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance , he added.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
The cardinals will also be the first to be elected since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world who are tasked with examining ways to reform the church.
Before, the pope made his own decision.
 From now on, Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him , Valero explained.
He added that it was  quite possible  that Francis asked the cardinals for advice.
But we've never seen such a situation before. It's totally new.
Valero said popes generally elevated bishops representing large communities to the rank of cardinal, but that Francis was  full of surprises  so we don't know who he will appoint .
GM is recalling some of its new pickups in the US to repair the seat file
General Motors Co is recalling nearly 19,000 of its all-new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 pickups to address a problem with manually tilting cases, according to a statement Friday from the U.S. vehicle safety regulatory body.
On some pickups, the front seats may have a defect in the tilting mechanism.
As a result, the records do not comply with federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
 If the vehicle is hit from the rear, the head restraint may not properly protect passengers, thus increasing the risk of injury , according to the statement posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The recalled models were built between 1 August and 10 September.
The deployment of GM pickups began in June and represents the largest vehicle launch for the first American automaker since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the owners of the pickup trucks of the failure during the first quarter of October.
The NHTSA was unable to review the owner's letter of information due to the 16-day government shutdown, which slowed vehicle sales growth in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, increased by about 20 percent in the first 10 months of the year, GM said Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM's stock price has soared 1.4 percent to $37.47 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.
A worker dies buried under concrete blocks
A construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks on Thursday afternoon in Montreal.
The tragedy occurred at approximately 11:00 a.m. on Marquette Street, near the intersection of Beaubien Street in the Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie district.
The foundation work was likely to have been carried out on this site for some time.
A mitochondrial wall had just been erected in the last few days.
The accident happened when the victim had just arrived at the construction site to retrieve her tools.
I was driving by and saw the wall collapse with a big cloud of smoke", said Sylvain Jean, who lives near the construction site.
I got off the plane and went to remove the large bricks that covered it.
We could only see a part of her back, it's so unfortunate.
According to the authorities, the victim is a man in his 50s who worked for a blacksmithing firm.
Resuscitation attempts were made by the emergency services, but without success.
The man did not survive his serious injuries.
An inspector from the Occupational Safety and Health Commission was dispatched to the scene to investigate the circumstances surrounding the tragedy.
The cry of desperation of an Obama voter
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of change.
He says Obama made a commendable effort but was thwarted by the Republican Party's obstructionism.
Obstructionism doesn't excuse the difficulties of the Obamacare site, or drone attacks.
The memory of Obama's 2008 campaign is a sad reminder of what could have happened.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year medical student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a terribly sad book these days.
It's a book that I thought would encourage me through the drudgery of my second year of medical school and give me hope.
It's called  The Audacity to Win  and it's a memoir of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish the medical records of my patients at night and go to bed, this book brings me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and speeches could take your breath away.
The election ended in a landslide victory and news presenters took time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment.
My classmates cried with joy, and my parents kept all the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries was advancing toward the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During the transition period of Obama before he took office in 2008, he had 82 percent favorable opinion.
And then I close the book.
Going back to the present is a difficult awakening, it's like coming out of a dream.
It's hard to remember those days of optimism, they're like distant memories, a sad reminder of past opportunities.
The change really happened in the years after I first voted.
It had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I credit Obama with great achievements, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to the withdrawal of our military from Iraq, to the end of the 'never seen or known' and the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
I also believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to move our nation forward in immigration reform, public health care, and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after repeatedly defending the Obama administration to my peers and colleagues, I can no longer provide an explanation.
I'm on the verge of political despair.
The Republican blockade cannot explain the wiretapping of foreign leaders, nor the drone attacks on innocent foreign children.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on Americans' privacy, nor the indictment of whistleblowers who expose government wrongdoing.
It cannot justify the murder of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without trial, or the evasion of public funding and the excess of authorized spending during presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the findings of a report that says the White House's efforts to silence the media are the most aggressive since the Nixon administration.
And, more recently, she can't excuse the inability to design a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was ratified.
I don't know if this is what I expected.
If, at 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Of course, the election function is not predictable, because the opposition political party and random events, such as the Newton massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have listed above seem to be largely the choice of the administration.
That's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confused and unrefined alternative that did not seem to allow for determining his policies or positions.
I felt that Obama, elected to a second term by being released from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises we've been hearing about for so long.
But while the favourable opinion index has fallen below 45% this week, it is even more difficult to go back to 2008 with this book.
It makes me want the many promises that have flown.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered huge losses in favor of Clinton in the Pennsylvania primaries.
At a post-campaign meeting, he told his team that they needed to get back on track and stay true to their cause.
 I want us to focus on our talent , he said.
We need to remember who we are.
We are here five years later, Mr. President, and I disagree with you.
The views expressed in this comment are those of Nathaniel Morris only.
On Friday, at about 3 p.m., a violent motorcycle-car collision occurred on Retinne Street in Fléron.
The motorcyclist, Jonathan, 26, from Fléron, was not wearing a helmet.
Despite the quick response of the rescue workers, he died in the head-on collision.
Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over the parental leave system.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer argues that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and benefit from it.
The mining tycoon, who disputes the payment of a $6 million carbon tax, has made this argument in an attempt to rule out questions about a possible conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether to abolish carbon and mining taxes.
But Mr Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr Abbott's daughters were willing to personally benefit from these policies.
 He will have a significant conflict of interest when it comes to paying parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not she gets leave , Mr Palmer said.
Two months after his election, the Electoral Commission officially declared that Mr. Palmer won the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax by 53 votes, after counting again.
Mr Palmer has proposed a change in the voting system to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over?
 We need a better system , he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can log in, enter your contact information into a computer, vote immediately and get the results at 6:30 the next morning?
Mr Palmer also criticized the use of paper pencils to mark ballots.
Is it to erase the result if someone disagrees?
Nowadays, having a paper pencil seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has examined the possible options for electronic voting and recently published a joint reflection paper with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer, 59, said his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new duties very seriously.
The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service.
 We are not looking for a reward, except for the reward of history because we must serve the community at a critical time , he added.
A team of biologists led by the New York Wildlife Conservation Society has identified a new species of humpback dolphin off the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, a scientific missionary at the Observatory for the Conservation and Study of Marine Animals and Mechanical Environment (OCEAMM), returned to L'Express about this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Is the discovery of this new species of humpback dolphin surprising you?
That's good news, but it doesn't surprise me particularly.
While in the past species were described and identified on a morphological, anatomical and geographical basis, today the development of new tools such as genetics allows us to improve our knowledge of the science of species classification.
It is not impossible that these advances in genetics and molecular biology could challenge the classification or belonging of a species to a genus, a family, or even an order.
In the early 19th century, morphologists classified animals based on the morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these classifications are being questioned because of advances in genetics.
Similarly, two very similar species have been genetically distinguished.
This is the case with the new species that has just been identified.
About a decade ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: the Pacific hump dolphin and the Atlantic hump whale.
Recent analyses have distinguished four species.
Why is this a major discovery as claimed by the Wildlife Conservation Society?
From a conservation perspective, it is essential to know these genetic differences in order to protect the species and therefore its genetic variability.
Although this population was known to researchers for a long time, they did not know that it was part of a new species, present only in this place.
So if there is a problem of massive deaths from a viral outbreak or accidental capture in the region, we could be dealing with the extinction of a species, rather than a local extinction of a population of a more widespread species on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered threatened or endangered depending on the number of individuals on Earth, i.e. the stock, and the possibility that it can recover from nearby stocks.
The population of the newly discovered species, Sousa chinensis, has automatically become weaker, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats, where there is a lot of genetic exchange between populations and individuals.
This brewing of genes limits the creation of new species.
Conversely, more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can eventually lead to the creation of new species.
It should be noted that the marine environment is the least known.
We'd rather send robots to Mars than find out what lives in the Mariana Trench, just 11 kilometers from the surface of the sea.
We spend more money on life on other planets than we do on marine research, and it's time for that to change.
RBS suspends two traders on the foreign exchange market
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange market division according to two sources close to the case, which shows once again that the global regulator's investigation into suspicions of currency market manipulation is beginning to bear fruit.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in surveys of the world's largest financial market, where US$5.3 trillion is changing hands every day.
The two traders are the first RBS employees to be suspended as part of the expansion of the investigation that echoes the Libor interbank rate manipulation scandal.
The bank, which declined to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from regulators.
 The ongoing investigation into this case is ongoing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators , a bank representative said two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the case said RBS had passed on emails and instant messages files, sent to and from a former trader, to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and was reportedly suspended from his position as European Head of Cash Trading for Currencies at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European head of cash exchange trading at Citi, was laid off this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged.
Mr. Usher's file included instant messages sent to and from bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, sources close to the file added.
UBS explained this week that it had filed a lawsuit against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, said it was investigating suspicions of foreign exchange market manipulation in a number of Swiss banks.
Worldwide, at least six authorities  the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority  are reviewing allegations made about bankers who have agreed to manipulate rates in the foreign exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Crédit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, sources close to the case said.
Banks have been searching for instant messages and emails sent for years to find cases of wrongdoing.
The news of these surveys has shocked traders in a sector that has been one of the biggest drivers of growth for investment bank trading units in recent years, but which has been challenged this year due to low currency volatility that limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the deal by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast highly liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily foreign exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between trading management platforms and the increasing use by banks of their own internal platforms  explains why it is possible to start making a market impact at little expense .
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced it had fired a trader working at its London Stock Exchange office this week after causing a $6 million loss late last year.
The bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with regulators.
 We are convinced that the trader acted alone and that the case was handled , said a representative of Credit Suisse.
Mayor Rob Ford's investigation was foiled, a lawyer claims
After police confirmed they had seized a copy of the video that showed Rob Ford smoking crack, Me Clayton Ruby claimed he had never seen an investigation "so messy".
Ruby told me to believe the Canadian Press that the police had "ignored or downplayed" evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, police arrested Rob Ford's friend and occasional driver, 35-year-old Alexander Lisi, and charged him with extortion in connection with the video.
Alexander Lisi, who was previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
Police said they also observed the man delivering parcels to Rob Ford, new court documents indicate.
Ruby called me "unexplained" that the police never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or home, or tapped his phone, arguing that Chief Bill Blair chose not to take action against the mayor.
Under the law, police, having witnessed suspicious transactions on their own hands, could very well have intercepted Rob Ford's vehicle, arrested the mayor, and conducted a search - even without a warrant.
It could also have requested an immediate search warrant if deemed necessary.
The police chief did not comment, but his spokesman Mark Pugash called Ms Ruby's comments an "obvious and desperate attempt" to appeal to the media in a case that has no bearing on him.
At a press conference on Thursday, Mr Blair said there was nothing in the video that could constitute "reasonable grounds" for a criminal charge against the mayor.
European stock markets are down at half-time except for London
With the exception of London, major European exchanges are down on Friday at mid-season, led by some disappointing company news, while Wall Street is expected to rise.
Moreover, investors remain cautious as they believe that the US Federal Reserve could end its quantitative easing policy sooner than expected.
Conversely, after the announcement of inflation of 0.7% for the euro area as a whole, the idea that the European Central Bank (ECB) could relax its monetary policy has spread among market players.
Wall Street futures are a sign of a reopening of U.S. stocks upward, after two consecutive retreats.
At the end of the year, the market share of the CAC 40 declined by 4.6% and the share of the CAC 40 declined by 4.6% in the same period.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) is the worst performing EuroFirst300, after also publishing downward results this morning and announcing the creation of a 'bad bank' structure with 38 billion pounds of the most risky assets.
Vodafone (+2,45%) is also leading the EuroFirst300 increase in response to a press release calling on AT&T to investigate a possible OPA.
In the foreign exchange market, speculation about the ECB's monetary policy is going strong, as Saxo Bank strategist John Hardy points out.
The ECB's single mandate has always been on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reason to act at next week's meeting.
We anticipate a strong potential for a fall in the euro.
The euro continues to fall against the US currency and has reached a two-week low of $1.3517.
The same assumptions support the euro area bond market.
Supreme Court upholds Obama's health care reform law
Big victory for the Obama administration: The U.S. Supreme Court today declared the Obama-ratified health care reform law constitutional.
By a vote of 5 to 4, the judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which requires citizens to take out health insurance by 2014, subject to a fine, and declared it constitutional under the government's taxing power.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined the four most liberal members of the Court, while Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed their disagreement.
The Court also validated the other sections of the 2,700-page law and also found that the provision of the Health Care Reform Act, which states that the Medicaid eligibility threshold must be lowered in the event of losing all federal funding for the program, was constitutionally coercive.
The procedure to block the law has been initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All major Republican presidential candidates running in the 2012 primary, including nominated Mitt Romney, have vehemently opposed the law.
A vibrating tribute to the veterans of Menton
At the heart of the Trabuquet Cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, paid tribute to soldiers and those who died in all wars this Friday afternoon.
Grapes were laid in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by Deputy Mayor Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Palestinian-Israeli clashes at the Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers were wounded on Thursday evening, 31 October 2013, in a violent clash on the Gaza-Israel border, the most serious incident in Palestinian territory in a year.
The only power plant in the Gaza Strip ceased operation on Friday 1 November after its fuel stocks ran out, the Palestinian Authority for Energy said.
A local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another Hamas military official, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a tank shell during an Israeli army raid east of Khan Younes in the southern Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local Al-Qassam Brigade officials, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, were killed when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same area.
Their bodies were discovered later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four fighters were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
Attack on a tunnel dug by Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli chariot and armored bulldozer raided the interior of the territory for about a hundred meters before retreating.
The confrontation lasted about half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a statement, a Hamas spokesman, Sami Abu Zouhri, paid tribute to the four "heroes" and claimed that Israeli soldiers were killed in the clashes.
Hamas congratulates the Al-Qassam heroes who fell defending the territory during the Zionist occupation of Khan Younes.
Several enemies were killed and wounded during the operation.
"Hamas assures that Gaza will be a hell for the occupier", the spokesman threatened.
The Israeli military said that the target of its operation was initially a section of a wide tunnel dug into Israeli territory from the Palestinian enclave, discovered on 7 October and intended, according to the army, for "terrorist activities".
Hamas claimed to use tunnels to fight Israel, stating that the purpose was to take Israeli soldiers and exchange them for Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using the tunnel, an Israeli military statement said.
During the operation, Hamas detonated an explosive device targeting the IDF (Israeli army) and wounded 5 soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of using the terrorist tunnel to attack Israeli civilians", said army spokesman Peter Lerner.
Israel also struck an air base in northwestern Syria, targeting a cargo of missiles for the Lebanese Shiite Hezbollah movement, Al-Arabiya satellite reported Thursday, October 31.
An American official confirmed an "Israeli strike" but did not give details about the target.
"In the past, targets have been missiles transferred to Hezbollah", he added.
Israeli officials have refused to confirm any information about such an attack.
Citing "exclusive sources" it did not name, the Saudi capital channel said that "the bombing targeted a cargo of surface-to-air missiles that were aimed at Hezbollah in Lebanon", referring to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement fighting the rebels alongside Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, reported several explosions heard early Wednesday morning at an air defense base in Sonar Jablé, near Latakia, on the Syrian coast.
The organization, which relied on a network of activists and medical sources, had been unable to identify the source of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents her two new group choreographies at Danse Danse: the first inspired by the inks and poems of Henri Michaux, the second inspired by Satie's famous piano solos Gymnopédies.
A night that allows you to see the whole prism of Chouinard, from art to tics and black ink to white.
A white screen serves as a wall of background.
On the carpet, so white, in the vast space that is the Maisonneuve Theatre, stands, profile, fine as a line and dressed in black, a body.
On the screen, an ink by Henri Michaux is projected.
The body, a simple trait, takes shape.
And this shape will be the shape of the whole room: a bunch of physical imitations of the drawings.
The dancers, fully dressed in black, with only their hands and face uncovered, wait on either side of the playground, rush out when the next graphic appears, embody it, run out.
This black and white play by Henri Michaux is performed in solo relay, in a group unison (a mass that does solo), in a large group of twelve solos where each performs his sign.
We think of "Morning Glory", where Chouinard performed a series of choreographic tasks written on posters, put online at the front of the stage.
It's the same principle, giant PowerPoint version.
Here, the music is loud, percussion and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the pace is always fast.
There will be a break when Carol Prieur will take refuge under the dance mat, to deliver, microphone in hand, without sobriety or restraint, a part of Michaux's poem, monochorded and monotonous in the chorus, and will continue dancing.
And the music of going back, and the sequence of going back.
This long, energetic, loud discharge, if possible, eventually deafens and numbs.
And so does the regularity of visual rhythm.
There are some beautiful flashes -- creating images has always been a strength at Chouinard -- like those hair that grow out or those black fabrics that stretch the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
It seems that the choreographer, instead of going to meet Michaux's work, has imposed herself with her tics.
The result is that the bodies appear flat in front of the drawings.
Michaux's inks, like Gestalt forms, open up a wider, more giant imagination than dance, more porous.
Only the ending, in the negative, with its dancers cut by a stroboscopic light and the white signs in a suddenly black theater, touches the magic.
The audience liked it, and the reception was warm.
Gymnopedies, after the interact, are richer.
The stage is partially grey, the dancers and a piano are covered in fabrics, like furniture in an abandoned house.
On the piano, dancers take turns playing the notes.
Their touching, uncomfortable music gives them a real fragility.
On stage, couples are paired in a romantic, very sensual, even erotic, duo.
Group work, little solo transitions, moving ensembles, choirs, writing is less binary.
The same buffalo, familiar to Chouinard, appear with a red nose in a highly polarized male-female love parade.
Love is a carnival, a fugitive, a gambler.
The gestures, the laughter and the small screams are a beautiful transition to the archaic, graceful and ridiculous of the coitus bodies of the melting creatures.
But the play takes its real flight after the rescue.
A clown comes back on stage when the audience leaves.
There everything is allowed: the fourth wall falls, the explored universes overlap, the dancers co-operate, descend among the spectators, glosses, smokes, short-circuits, codes of applause, and stretch the sauce into a cleverly calculated disorder that remains sensual.
Joy and madness sweat, and it's Chouinard's art here to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are being sued for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, launched an avalanche of patent lawsuits Thursday against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company it put up for auction after Nortel went bankrupt.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
The patents contain technologies that allow advertising in relation to search terms on the Internet, the court findings said, which is the core of Google's business.
It was not possible to contact representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones that run on Google's Android operating system, which puts Apple and Microsoft in fierce competition.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of $900 million for Nortel's patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, and finally it's up to $4.4 billion.
After losing Nortel's patents to Rockstar, Google later acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a market partially based on Motorola's patent library.
 Although Google failed to acquire the patents in question during the auction, it violated and continues to violate those patents , the court findings indicated.
Rockstar claims greater damages against Google, as it claims that Google's patent infringement is obstinate, according to the complainant.
Home explosion in Gesves: defective water heater caused the explosion
Grandma reportedly lit a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion of a house in Gesves, which left two seriously injured on Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, was caused by a leak of gas from a faulty water heater, the deputy King's Prosecutor said on Friday evening.
The expert sent by the prosecutor's office to the scene says the explosion was an accidental one.
Grandma lit a cigarette while there was a leak and a buildup of gas.
The vital prognosis for both victims is still underway.
Grandma was thrown into the explosion and burned to death.
The little boy, who was staying with his grandfather and his companion, was beside him and was slightly burned.
"The two victims were intubated and conditioned for a long time before being taken to the CHU in Liège, she by helicopter, he by ambulance", said Mayor José Paulet, who arrived on the scene.
Traumatically, Grandpa was upstairs when the explosion happened.
He was able to reach the ground floor by stairs that remained intact while the back wall of the house was completely destroyed.
The grandfather and the tenant of the nearby house, which was weakened by the explosion, were moved by the CPAS president.
And the firefighters of Andenne and Namur and the Arches Police have intervened.
Crisnée's civil protection has stabilized both buildings.
Egypt asks the first freely elected president to take an oath
Mohamed Morsi took the oath of office, but it is unlikely that his triumph will mark the end of the political conflict in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a new Egypt when he took the oath of office, becoming the first freely elected president and successor to Hosni Mubarak who was ousted from power 16 months earlier.
When he was sworn in to the Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president in the Arab world and the fifth head of state of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He swore an oath before the 18 judges in black court dress whose building on the Nile was built to resemble an Egyptian temple.
 We aspire to a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic , President Morsi said during the solemn ceremony broadcast live on public television.
 Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life  absolute freedom, true democracy and stability , said Mr Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the United States, from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been considered for more than 84 years since its formation as an illegal organization and harshly suppressed by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police were guarding the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered outside the courthouse to applaud the new president, and, unlike the presidential glories of the Mubarak years, traffic was only briefly interrupted to allow his convoy to pass through the busy streets connecting the city center to the southern suburbs.
Considered the uncharismatic 'relief wheel' of the Muslim Brotherhood, his personal prestige has been greatly enhanced since his victory and Friday's speech in which he tried to stand as the candidate not only of Islamists but of all those who want to finish the work begun during the 2011 uprising against authoritarian President Mubarak.
 Egypt is now a civil, national, constitutional and modern state , Mohamed Morsi, dressed in blue and red tie, said, addressing the judges in the woodworking room where he took the oath.
Morsi later went to Cairo University where he delivered his inaugural address.
He was officially greeted by a military band who played the national anthem while he was on guard duty.
Marshal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
On his arrival, he was greeted by the song  People and Army, hand in hand...  sung by thousands of people gathered in the university's large amphitheater.
Founded in 1908 and formerly a stronghold of secular education, Cairo University later became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Mr Morsi took the symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian regime last year began, and vowed to reclaim the presidential powers that the military council, which replaced the ousted former president, had deposed him.
But by accepting to formally take the oath before the Court rather than the Parliament as usual, he bows to the will of the army by showing that the power struggle is not over.
Mr Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
The shutdown in the US has slowed the growth of the car market
The 16-day closure of most federal administrations weighed on the growth of U.S. car sales in October, manufacturers' figures released Friday show, with five of the top six performing below expectations.
The three major Detroit manufacturers are showing double-digit growth compared to October 2012, but only General Motors has done better than expected.
Analysts anticipated an average of 15.4 million annual sales and adjusted seasonal changes but the market was 15.3 million according to estimates by Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas.
In a note to the bank's customers, he said that the slight downturn was primarily due to "the government shutdown and its impact on consumer sentiment in the first 15 months".
However, GM reported an increase of almost 16% in sales last month to 226,402 vehicles, compared with the 211,563 expected by consensus.
The four brands of the group have seen their commercial performance improve compared to October 2012.
Ford, which continues to benefit from the success of its pickup trucks, saw sales increase by 14% over the year to 199,985 vehicles, compared with a consensus expectation of 194 301.
Chrysler, which is controlled by Fiat, announced an 11% increase in sales to 140,083 vehicles, compared with 143,536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also reported lower sales than the consensus, despite year-on-year increases of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively.
At the New York Stock Exchange, GM shares gained 1.4% at 4:35 GMT while Ford gave up 1.1%.
Renault floated on the stock exchange following a warning from Nissan
Renault blamed Friday for the biggest drop in the SBF 120 index in Paris after its partner Nissan Motor announced it had cut its annual net profit forecast by nearly 20%, traders report.
Nissan, which had to undergo such a review, also announced a change in management.
Several traders reported that Renault stock was affected by the "warning" this morning.
"This is clearly Nissan's warning profit", says a trading officer at a Parisian brokerage.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault owns 43.4% of Nissan's capital and the Japanese manufacturer 15% of the French, according to data from Nissan's website.
Greece: Two dead in a shooting near a neo-Nazi party building
Two people were killed and another seriously injured on Friday night by gunfire from two people on a motorcycle passing a neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party building in the western suburbs of Athens, police sources said.
Police were unable to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that members of Golden Dawn claimed that the victims were guards of their local area.
The injured person was immediately taken to hospital, according to the same source.
Police from the counter-terrorism department rushed to the central avenue of the Neo Iraklio suburb where the incident took place and surrounded the neighborhood.
The incident comes weeks after six members of Golden Dawn, including the party's leader and founder, were charged with involvement in a "criminal organisation" as part of an offensive against the party launched after an anti-fascist musician was killed by one of its members.
Scott Brown's appeal rejected
Scott Brown, captain of Celtic Glasgow, has seen his call rejected and will be suspended for his club's next two Champions League games against Ajax and AC Milan.
After being sent off against Barça for hitting Neymar, the Scottish midfielder was suspended for three games by UEFA.
In a statement, his club said it was "very disappointed", believing his appeal was fully justified.
Nearly 50,000 households across the province were without power shortly after noon on Friday, due to strong winds hitting many areas along the St. Lawrence River.
The sectors most affected are the Laurentian region with 15,042 subscribers in the dark, Montérégie with 13,464 and Outaouais with 8642.
The Greater Montreal area is also experiencing some of its failures, with nearly 7,000 power-deprived homes in the metropolis and Laval.
You thought travel agencies were a thing of the past because of the Internet?
Flight Center seems to be reversing the trend.
The company has revised its net profit forecast to increase and expects record results from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects to make a profit for the whole year between $325 million and $340 million before tax, compared with a previous forecast of $305 million to $315 million.
If current forecasts are met, this will represent 12 to 17% growth compared to the record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/12.
Chief Executive Graham Turner said that Flight Centre had made 8% profit in the first half and that the second half had started strong, particularly with regard to non-business travel to Australia and the UK.
 Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present are profitable, and several of them are on track to achieve record results for the whole year before interest and tax deductions, he said.
This is the case in Australia and the United Kingdom, which are generally the countries that generate the greatest profits.
In Australia, leisure travel bounced back in the second half, which helped offset a slightly declining domestic business travel market.
Similarly in the UK, the leisure travel sector of Flight Centre has been successful, while business customers have spent less.
Its US subsidiary recovered losses in the first half of the year when seasonal demand was lower and was to make a profit for the whole year for the third consecutive year.
Flight Center's stock has increased 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Strangers shooting at a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo
Strangers caught fire on a hotel near the Cairo pyramids in Egypt on Friday without causing any casualties, as a result of an apparent quarrel with dismissed employees.
The attackers fled, said Interior Ministry spokesman, police chief Abdel Latif.
The attack comes as Egypt has received almost no tourists since the army ousted Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in early July and bloodyly suppressed the protests of his supporters.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In English literature classes, students will be required to study at least one play by Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, a romantic poem, and a contemporary British fiction work from 1914 to the present.
The review will also present new texts to encourage more diverse reading.
A course combining English literature and language will be removed.
From 2015, students will have to pass an independent language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education is due to publish tomorrow its new English and math programmes  the first subjects to undergo a radical revision.
It will make changes in other fundamental subjects next year.
In addition, Ofqual, the exam regulator, will unveil a change in the structure of the GCSEs, with a new rating system and fewer courses.
Speaking during the summer, Michael Gove, Minister for Education, said there was a broad consensus on the need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence, stressing that the GCSEs would be more stimulating, ambitious and rigorous.
Studies show that English schools spend less time on math (116 hours a year, or 3 hours a week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year, and Singaporean students teach about 138 hours a year.
Although there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of the time allocated to mathematics, sources close to the coalition government have indicated that the GCSE in in-depth mathematics  and the increased emphasis on subjects in international rankings  would likely encourage schools to provide more hours of class.
The programme will focus more on real-world problems, particularly financial mathematics.
This judgment means that a law passed in July in that state that broadly challenges the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
A man in his 80s welcomes children with a rifle to the Muy for Halloween
Children between the ages of 9 and 13 went door-to-door to get candy on Halloween night.
One of the residents of the Muy neighborhood visited by the children opened the door holding his hunting rifle.
The 86-year-old man told the police he was afraid.
His gun was seized.
The former Gestapo chief buried in a Jewish cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of World War II and was never found, was actually buried in a mass grave in a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says German Resistance Memorial director Professor Johannes Tuchel in Bild.
Müller didn't survive the war.
"His body was buried in 1945 in a common grave in the Jewish cemetery of Berlin-Mitte", he told the newspaper in a press release, citing archival documents.
This revelation, 68 years after Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime ended, would answer one of the great puzzles of the postwar period.
The German secret service, the BND, said that during the summer of 1949, Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
The secret service was totally wrong.
"As early as August 1945, Müller's body was found in a temporary grave near the former Reich Air Ministry by a commando", says Tuchel.
He was wearing "a general's uniform".
"In the left inner pocket were his service statements with a photo", he continues.
Bild also publishes a document from the Berlin district municipality of Mitte indicating that he was buried in the Jewish cemetery in the district.
The president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Dieter Graumann, said he was shocked by this revelation.
That one of the most brutal Nazi sadists is buried in a Jewish cemetery is a terrible thing.
"The memory of the victims is being crushed with the feet", he insists in the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller was one of the most important figures of the Third Reich who was never captured.
He participated in the Wannsee Conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and, among other things, had Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistics" of the extermination of Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

Walking through the mud, jungle and across rivers to offer free medical care
Dr Georges Bwelle provides free healthcare in Cameroon's villages
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this West African country, barely one in every 5,000 inhabitants.

Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN Heroes of the Year 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the 10 other heroes, to elect him CNN Hero of the Year.
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father alternate periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and visit hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only one arm broken, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that would carry the aftermath for the rest of his life.
 There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon , said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him abroad if we had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years accompanying her father to crowded clinics and hospitals, so that he could get any treatment he could benefit from.
 It is not easy , Mr Bwelle adds.
You can leave home at 5:00, rush to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed much since Dr Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor per 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
By comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 doctor for 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians could not afford the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of the country's healthcare spending is made in the private sector.
 The only problem they have is poverty , Dr Bwelle explained.
And because of poverty, they can't enjoy life.
After seeing his father and so many of his fellow countrymen suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed more than 700 free surgeries last year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at the central hospital in Yaoundé.
And he created a nonprofit humanitarian organization, ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, they and about 30 others pile up in vans after they have fixed the medical equipment on the roof and cross rough terrain to reach the villages that need the most help.
Luck doesn't always follow them.
They had to push their vehicles to cross rivers or muddy tracks many times.
But when they arrive, they are greeted as heroes: the community organizes a party, sings and dances and offers them the best accommodation available.
In these villages, free healthcare is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr Bwelle  with his big smile and his overflowing energy  is more than happy to join the festivities.
The next morning, the team starts receiving hundreds of patients.
 We receive 500 people each visit, Mr Bwelle said.
Sometimes they live 60 kilometers from the village, and they come on foot.
This traveling hospital provides a variety of health care services.
Many people are being treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive candy, a pair of collected glasses or a free birth certificate  a document necessary to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgical procedures under local anesthesia.
The operation is usually performed in a school, town hall, or home; after the operation, the patient rises and goes to the wake room to leave room for the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the generator, the operating room and the sterilization of the equipment, Dr Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday morning.
It's a grueling rhythm, but the village musicians usually help the band stay motivated.
 They're playing drums all night to keep us awake so we can keep working , Mr Bwelle explained.
On Sunday, the team goes back to town, tired but proud of the work they've done.
The group, made up of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, performed 700 free surgeries last year, and they know that their presence can make a big difference for those they help.
One man explained that the free surgery he had undergone to treat a hernia would allow him to work again.
 It will change my future and that of my family , the man said.
In addition to running this itinerant hospital and working as a hospital surgeon, Dr Bwelle also works at night in private medical offices around Yaoundé.
He explains that 60% of his association's funding comes from this second job, the rest from private donations.
"I don't know when he's sleeping", said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer in Dr. Bwelle's group.
He's still in the hospital or trying to raise money for his association so he can run these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students like Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr Bwelle in his missions, it is an opportunity to learn in the field that they do not have at home.
 We may have participated in operations to help sponge the blood or to pass the instruments to Dr. Bwelle , Ms. O'Malley explained.
It's not something you get the chance to do in America when you're a second-year medical student.
Volunteer students usually pay for their travel to Cameroon, often arriving with medical supplies.
But once in Yaoundé, their boarding house, transportation and education are taken care of by Dr Bwelle.
"He's a hero, there's no doubt about it", Katie O'Malley said.
He gave his life for this association, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is not going to go out.
For Dr Bwelle, relatively constant workload is not a problem.
Helping others live happily by keeping the promise he made to his father is something that brings him great joy.
 I am so happy when I do this work , Mr Bwelle added.
And I think about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Making people laugh and relieving pain are the reasons I do this.

The Two French of Pierre Nora
Perplexed, academics have long struggled to define and locate Pierre Nora.
Teacher in the amphitheaters and classrooms?
Probably, but pointing out his weakness for crossroads, Sciences Po, Higher Education.
Arbitrating for other people's works in his office on Gaston-Gallimard Street?
Yes, but by ignoring the secret work and the secret writing of the publisher.
Heir to the chair Fontenelle held at the French Academy?
Yes, but knowing that such a sacred thing could not replace the true holy oil, that of the thesis which he passed.
They were willing to acknowledge him as a great awakener, a leader and a facilitator of their work, but they noticed that he showed little inclination to produce it himself.
The monument of the "Lays of Memory", to which he attached his name, also contributed to this uncertain image.
The wicked tongues could see a huge flea market, presented by an intelligent commentator, with a keen eye and a keen eye for learning, but an unabashedly amusing one.
Nora's two books published two years ago have already established that the one who passed out for not writing had a lot and a good writing.
This book should definitely do her justice.
Yet again, we find the temptation to be ubiquitous, to be intellectually vague, to be joyful, to jump like a pair of shoes.
But it is quickly understood that the disparate objects gathered in this book's beautiful title bring the brocanteur back to a single passion: to discover the knot that constitutes French identity.
Why these dramatic calls for national unity?
Identity: It's a concern of the times.
We have been invited collectively to define it.
But in the peremptory spirit of our leaders of the day, the French identity was a timeless essence.
The only thing that was required was to disseminate the accidents, and the case, Jacobinism required, was entrusted to the prefects and subprefects, authorized interpreters.
The one that Pierre Nora is after is a different person.
He doesn't claim to inherit eternal frankness, he refuses to be defined.
An analyst worried about a familiar strangeness, he wanders through a forest of symbols, stopped at every step by a rebuff-shaped object, tormented by irritating questions.
The Commission has already adopted a number of proposals for a directive on the protection of workers' rights and the right to freedom of movement.
They are so urgent, suggests Pierre Nora, that they only remove the confusion arising from the discord in French history.
Franks and Gauls, Armagnacs and Bourguignons, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division here are very old.
And the most iconic is, of course, the one that splits national history in two.
Since the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have had two histories and they have two nations, one monarchical and the other revolutionary.
The second wife desired the death of the first wife, but could not deny it, but was anxious to find the sanctity of the first wife, and even more so to the unity and indissolubility of the one who was the obvious and powerful incarnation.
And from there, an invincibly binary nation, divided between left and right, secularism and Catholicism, worship and hatred of the revolution.
To make this singularity of French identity felt, nothing is worth the four steps outside the Hexagon, so Pierre Nora's American escape may well be the heart of his book.
Because America and France have both made a revolution, written a bill of rights, wanted to found a new society.
But American cousinage is only better at emphasizing what is proper to us.
There were men who had left their old regime in England and had no more to worry about.
Here are the crowded men of an old indigenous regime, and even more radical.
There was a consensual revolution when here she sowed drama and confit.
There are founding fathers who are always respected, and here are revolutionary ancestors who are hard to model, and who have killed each other.
There is an institutional constancy, and here a cascade of constitutions, as many mistakes to catch up and attempts to repeat.
France that goes, France that comes
There was a time when the French believed they could re-write the torn dress of their history, and overcome the curse of number two.
At this pivotal and creative moment in the Third Republic, Pierre Nora showed great interest and even tenderness: he welcomed those who were then working to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching the schoolchildren everything that in ancient France obscurely prepared modern France and offering them a unified version of their history.
But this peaceful identity has only lasted a moment.
This is again a matter of debate, fuelled by a new kind of immigration, threatened by the rise of demanding minorities, absorbed into the European space.
The book thus offers both the fascinating portrait of France going and the outline of France coming.
And, as a bonus, the portrait of the historian, who should be reserving some surprises.
We find out that the camper was a local.
The man with multiple curiosities was a little obsessed with the same idea.
The rower of the sidings stood in the center of the center.
And the one who had presented, for more than half a century, a subject on the idea of a nation, but had eluded the initiatory exercise of the thesis, confides us, cum grano salis, that he will eventually do it.
Yes, in a less rigid, more brilliant and more subtle form.
But we're not wrong about that, it's just as binding.
Because more than the imposed figure of the university curriculum, this thesis says the inner necessity of life.
Former hostage in Lebanon: "Return is quite complex to handle"
Kidnapped in Beirut on 8 March 1986 with three members of his "Antenna 2" team who had come to film a Hezbollah demonstration, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released almost 21 months later on 27 November 1987.
Retired in 2008, he participated in the creation of the hostage advocacy association "Otages du monde" in 2004, which he chaired for several years.
Its main objective is to provide hostages with the opportunity to complain and bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court.
Detained for more than 1,000 days, the four hostages of Aqmi (Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the Val-de-Grâce Military Hospital on Wednesday afternoon, they were able to reunite with their families.
And try, little by little, to get back on track.
The New Observer interviewed Jean-Louis Normandin, 62, former senior reporter, retired since 2008, president of the "Otages du monde" association.
The night you were released, you were on the set of the 8:00 set of "Antenna 2".
What are your memories today of your release?
In particular, in Beirut.
When I get out, I find myself in the trunk of a car where I meet Roger Auque, but I don't see him because he's black.
He says we're free, but I'm not sure, and he says we can still be killed.
We're very excited, but we're also very tense.
It's war, and our leaders are also very tense.
They drop us off at the side of a sidewalk.
There's a Syrian military.
Then we arrive at the Summerland Hotel site where the press is present.
Frenchmen are taking us to the French embassy.
It's time for the first phone calls to parents, family, friends, the press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And having dinner in a T-shirt at the French embassy.
I also remember a short night of chatting with Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we have no means to evacuate to Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
We arrive there by helicopter, take a private plane, and we return to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua board.
How did your arrival on French soil go?
We're landing at Orly.
Chirac, the Prime Minister, is here.
It's a little brutal.
There's an incredible bump.
And a lot of media.
When I left there were three TV stations.
I come back and there's plenty of them.
The flight down the flight deck, the reunion with my son and my parents, my friends, all of this is extremely emotional.
Between the airport and my house, many motorcycles follow our car that Roussin drives.
The bikers pull their buttons to take pictures and follow me to my house where I have to do a little policing to keep some people from getting on.
The press is huge.
It doesn't stop. We're in a good position to know.
But the state of emotion and fatigue is so great that it's hard to see clearly.
We're out of a hole and we're suddenly under the media spotlight.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, a little complicated to handle.
But we did the hardest thing.
I'm at 8:00 that same night, and I'm on TV the next day.
Then start some sort of life-readaptation, very slowly, for a month or two that's kind of like a vacation.
How were the medical examinations and DGSE's debriefing?
I had the right to a first medical check-up in Corsica.
The rest was done at Val-de-Grâce the days after my return: radio broadcasts, examinations of all kinds and a meeting with a psychiatrist.
It's not a session that does everything but we know we can count on him, call him back if we need to, that we're not left to ourselves.
It's part of the process.
I also met with the intelligence community.
They asked me about the hostage takers.
It made sense.
I didn't mind that.
How are you reacting today to the release of the four hostages from Niger?
I listen to what's said.
The debate on ransoms is one of them.
Some things make me angry, some less.
I'm trying to split things between questions about my past as a hostage and my hat as president of the "Otages of the World" association which allows me to distance myself, and I find it much more interesting to address.
I wonder, for example, what is the definition of resilience?
I especially fight, with others, for the recognition of the legal status of hostages.
I think there's a semantic problem.
Hostage taking should be described as "political" hostage taking - which is often the case - and hostages should be allowed access to justice, to complain and to bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is feeling compassion, emotion, and joy at the release of these hostages.
But who says these hostages might have access to justice too?
A court in The Hague is for that.
Why not tell the hostage-takers "you have violated the rules of war, like all the Geneva Conventions, we will bring you to justice"?
But it seems to me to be justified, legitimate, and out of the ordinary.
That message is heard, but not listened to, and it shocks me.
This is my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists on the streets to denounce Morsi's trial
Anger is roaring in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the trial of deposed President Mohamed Morsi began, they took to the streets.
A mobilisation throughout Egypt to demand the restoration of the country's first democratically elected president.
This is not a trial, says the Muslim Brotherhood activist.
So far, no lawyer has been able to meet him, and no volunteer has been able to take a copy of the case files.
This is not a trial, this is a farce.
President Morsi's trial is a false trial. A pro-Morsi insurgency is supposed to be the one to bring Sisi to justice, not the other way around.
Morsi must sue Sisi for the Rabaa massacre, the Nahda massacre, and the Republican Guard massacre.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Clashes broke out in Alexandria, police used tear gas, 60 protesters were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police will be deployed outside the Cairo Police Academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be tried.
Hagel accuses nine U.S. states of violating gay rights
Since the federal government recognized same-sex marriage, "all military spouses have a right to a Department of Defense ID card and benefits", the minister recalled in New York in a speech to the Anti-Defamation League.
"But some states refuse to issue these cards to same-sex couples in the National Guard facilities" on their territory, he denounced, accusing these states of violating federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these people cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided in these bases, or access their stores.
The Secretary of Defense said he ordered the head of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure that federal law is enforced.
The nine-state scandal began with Texas refusing to implement these benefits on Texas National Guard sites because of a conflict between Texas law and the federal gay marriage law.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a senior defense official.
The Pentagon estimates the population affected by the recognition of same-sex marriage to be about 5,600 active duty personnel, including 17,000 National Guard, Reserve and retired personnel.
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard will be held this Saturday in Hyères .
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard will take place this Saturday, November 2 at the skate park in Hyères.
Organized by the SK8 Unity section of the Bump Association, the competition is expected to bring together the best skaters in the region.
Registration will take place on Saturday morning from 9 a.m. and the qualifying stages will begin at 10 a.m. before the final at 3 p.m. and the awards ceremony at 4 p.m.
The public will be able to admire the technical prowess of young people who, for some, are already competing at the highest level, like the young prodigy Lorenzo Palumbo.
At just 10 years old, he has already won his place at the European Championships in Copenhagen this year and he likes nothing so much as showing off to three-headed competitors.
Toronto mayor chases reporters who come to interview him about a drug case
In Canada, the mayor of Toronto is suspected of drug use, according to several media reports.
A video filed in court seems to support these suspicions.
The person involved, Rob Ford, has always denied using crack, while admitting to a cannabis addiction.
On Thursday, he kicked out several journalists who came to interview him.
We also think that sometimes images don't need explanation or comment.
A case of rabies detected in a cat in the Oise Valley
Authorities announced on Thursday 31 October that a case of rabies had been detected in a kitten in the Val-d'Oise, apparently of foreign origin, while France has been free of indigenous cases since 2001.
The kitten was found on October 25 in Argenteuil and died on October 28.
The Pasteur Institute confirmed the diagnosis of rabies.
"An epidemiological investigation has been launched to identify and monitor those who may have come into contact with this kitten between October 8 and October 28 inclusive", the health and agriculture ministries said.
"Five people who have been in contact with the kitten have already been identified" and have been given preventive treatment.
"In humans, the preventive treatment of human rabies, given after contact with the animal but before symptoms appear, is very effective", the statement said.
The departments now call on those who have been bitten, scratched, scratched or licked on a mucous membrane or skin damaged by this kitten or whose pet was in contact with this kitten between 8 and 28 October to contact them on 08.11.00.06.95 between 10am and 6pm from 1 November.
"With France free of rabies since 2001, this kitten or mother was imported from another country, not free", the statement said.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last recorded "native" case of rabies was in a fox in December 1998 and that "France was officially declared free of the disease in November 2001 by the International OIE".
A case of rabies on a dog imported illegally from The Gambia was recorded in 2008.
"Rabies is a deadly disease if not treated in time", the ministry recalls, and it is contagious for nearly 15 days before the first symptoms of the disease appear.
Obama backs down on his health care reform
Under a flood of criticism, President Obama yesterday reiterated his unambiguous and often-repeated promise that  if you're satisfied with your health plan, you can keep it .
After hundreds of thousands of people received notices of termination from their lenders, Republicans have criticized the president in recent days for deceiving the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
 The vast majority of people with health insurance that suits them can keep it , he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls a "heated up" news story about the terminations, President Obama urged Americans who received these notices to seek new insurance in the marketplace.
Most people will be able to get complete and better-fit health plans for the same price, or even cheaper than expected.
You'll come out winning, he said.
The administration announced that it should come as no surprise that the 5% of the population who self-insure would be forced to change plans because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
 Let me address these Americans directly: you deserve better , Kathleen Sebelius said in her testimony before the Energy and Commerce Commission in Washington.
Ms Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch of the online market in October had unfortunately failed.
 I am as frustrated and angry as anyone , she added.
I can't wait to regain your trust.
It was an angry Kathleen Sebelius who uttered this sentence, while she believed her microphone was cut off, addressing an assistant sitting behind her during the Assembly session yesterday following a contentious exchange of views with Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri, about whether she should join Obamacare.
For more than three hours, Billy Long kept asking Mrs. Sebelius why the architect of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily give up government-sponsored insurance to take out a plan through HealthCare.gov, which she now boasts to millions of Americans.
Foreign Vettel has a special headset in Abu Dhabi
The lucky one, Jake Vite Prekop, combined the colors of the car brand and the German flag, while incorporating the notions of speed and heat at the track level.
German Formula One world champion Sebastian Vettel on Friday unveiled a special headset designed by a 21-year-old Mexican fan for the free trials of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
Vettel selected 1,500 drawings from around the world for a competition launched by one of his sponsors, a car brand, in his yard.
He was invited to follow the Abu Dhabi GP, with a friend, and can therefore see the German champion up close, on the track and in his stand.
Vettel was supposed to wear this helmet on Friday and Saturday for the test.
He will likely have another special headset for the race on Sunday, intended to mark his fourth consecutive world title.
Aubervilliers resident launches his suburban party
Let's not get caught up in this.
In the spirit of its founder, Abdel-Malik Djermoune, the "Suburbs Party" is not just for suburbanists.
I chose a map of France as my logo, he justifies it.
When I speak of suburbia, I am speaking to all those who are excluded from the great national family.
Nevertheless, his project, presented at a press conference in his hometown of Aubervilliers on Thursday, was born of the desire to better defend multiculturalism, this great cultural melting pot that characterizes the neighbourhoods above all.
My proposal No 1 is to create a Ministry of Multiculturalism, he says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50, territorial attaché, today claims to be "100% apolitical" even though he has not always been neutral.
Militant in 2002 alongside Jean-Pierre Chevénement, he then supported Dominique de Villepin locally between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the values of equality that I advocate in my programme are linked to the left, but if the right are willing to support me, I will listen to them too, he continues.
I'm not talking about extremist parties.
Apart from multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built his programme - which can be consulted on the Internet - on many topics that are supposed to address the urban population and especially young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the majority of civilians at 16, the rehabilitation of the building guard function...
He said that the 2014 municipal elections could be fair.
It's a matter of time and money.
The Suburbs Party should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy and I hope in other cities as well.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune claims to have already seven headlines in metropolitan France and Martinique.
"And the support mail I've received since yesterday doesn't all come from the suburbs", he rejoices.
John Kerry admitted, unprecedentedly, that American espionage went too far in an inappropriate way.
John Kerry indicated a softening of the US defensive attitude towards its surveillance programmes by admitting, unprecedentedly, that on several occasions, espionage had gone too far inappropriately.
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, like Barack Obama, had governed  autopilot  when a series of incendiary revelations by whistleblower Edward Snowden about NSA espionage activities emerged.
The leaks have put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London via video link, Mr Kerry said:  It is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the government have learned some things in autopilot mode because we had the opportunity, from World War II to the difficult years of the Cold War, and then of course on 9/11. 
He later became the first senior member of the U.S. government to admit that American espionage had gone beyond the bounds, but insisted that everyone's rights had not been violated.
He said:  In some cases, it went too far inappropriately. 
And the President is determined to try to make it clear and clear to the people that he was now conducting a thorough review of these practices so that no one feels wrong.
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused in this process.
Mr Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added:  We live in a new world where people are ready to be blown up. 
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, blow them up and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We did prevent planes from falling, buildings from exploding, and people from being killed because we could learn the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, US lawmakers will travel to Europe to address concerns about the alleged US espionage case and convince Europeans that joint counterterrorism efforts with the US need to continue, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about the threats they had made about the possible withdrawal of anti-terrorist organizations due to the frustration of the National Security Agency's surveillance.
 It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain by our side in the mutual commitment to combat terrorism , said Murphy, a Democrat serving his first term and chairman of the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs, in an interview from Washington.
And I'm going to Europe to make sure they understand that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism, despite the anger provoked by NSA programs.
The press reports that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has damaged relations with some US allies, however the agency's director said this week that this was inaccurate and that it was a misunderstanding because it concerned metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the US.
Other revelations have reported documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA intercepted data and communications from the cell phones of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and those of 34 other heads of state.
Director of intelligence James Clapper justified the Allied espionage by stating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides.
In this tumultuous atmosphere, Murphy said his office was organizing a congressional trip, which is scheduled to take place this year, and that he hoped the delegation would include members of both parties and both houses.
The names of the other participating legislators should be released in the coming days.
He said the route was still to be determined.
Murphy said the purpose of this trip was to allow for improved relationships, but also to show  loving firmness .
He explained that European heads of state had to be honest with their citizens about the type of espionage programmes they themselves had been implementing for years.
 We can change our surveillance programmes to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they must also understand that we are not the only ones in the world doing espionage  said Murphy.
In the meantime, Mr Kerry is planning to travel this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to deal with the resentment generated by US strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange closed down on Thursday, driven by Shell's poor performance and the day after the Fed announced it would maintain its expected support for the economy.
Australian woman appeals her prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney resident sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a Phuket Provincial Court on June 15 of making false statements after telling Thai police that a local taxi driver, along with two other men who controlled her, assaulted her early on Sunday, June 10.
However, video surveillance records later revealed that she had returned to her hotel safely after separating from her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police questioned Bamford for two days before she confessed to making up the whole story.
She was held in a cell at the local police station before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low-security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket rather than a women's prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian rugby league player Peter Tunks, who appealed to the Canberra Foreign Ministry to help his daughter.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family were  extremely concerned  about her daughter's well-being and wanted her to return to Australia.
 We have obviously been through a troubling time, but we hope to bring her home safely as soon as possible , Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the verdict and was released after posting a bail of 50,000 baht.
In Australia, the press reported that she was on holiday in the Krabi region of southern Thailand.
Thai judicial sources said Bamford was represented by a local lawyer from Phuket, but warned that the appeal could lead to a further sentence of up to two years in prison and incarceration in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder in Phuket of Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand may also seek to rebuild its deteriorating image with tourists, which could lead to a acquittal.
French police will arrest Anderlecht supporters who come with different cars than RSCA
French police decided to lay down strict rules for the match between Royal Sporting Club Anderlecht and Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday, the spokeswoman for the Brussels police area Marie Verbeke said on Friday afternoon.
Belgian supporters of the RSCA who wish to attend this Champions League meeting will be required to use the travel system set up by the RSCA.
"The bus convoy will be escorted by police from a former border post in Rekem to the PSG stadium", the spokeswoman said.
The game will be the same for the return.
"If other supporters were planning to travel to Paris by other means, the French police prefecture has informed that measures have been taken to arrange arrests and even on-site guards", Marie Verbeke said.
Living together in French, the challenge of the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board
In the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board, 62% of pupils have a native language other than French.
