The members of the Welsh Assembly are afraid of looking like the Muppet.
Some members of the Welsh Assembly are appalled by the proposal that their title should be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament)
The reason for the proposal is the plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly across the political spectrum fear the title will be derided.
One Labour member said his group was concerned that it was "rhyme" with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside of Wales, in English, twp means stupid and pwp means shit.
A Plaid member said the group as a whole was not happy and suggested alternatives.
The Welsh Conservative said his group was moving to change the name to "open mind", but noted that MWP is close to the word Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is now preparing legislation to introduce name changes, said: 'The final decision on how members of the Welsh Assembly will be called will, of course, be up to the members themselves.
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, where a variant called the Welsh Assembly won wide support.
As for the title of Member of the Assembly, the committee preferred the Welsh Parliament Member, or WMP, but the MWP variant received the most support in public debate.
Members of the assembly are clearly proposing alternatives, but the struggle to reach consensus may cause concern for Speaker Elin Jones, who is due to table a bill in a few weeks.
The reform laws will include further changes to the functioning of the Assembly, including rules for disqualifying members and a draft committee system.
The members of the assembly will vote on the question of their title in the context of the discussion of new legislation.
Macedonians to vote on changing the country's name
On Sunday, voters will decide whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum is expected to settle a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to Greek territory, and has repeatedly protested against the country's EU and NATO membership applications.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is opposed to the name change plebiscite, has said he will not be guided by the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price for EU and NATO membership.
The bells at St. Martin's are going out, because the churches in Harlem are fighting for their survival.
"The old people I've spoken to say that there used to be a bar and a church on every corner", Mr Adams says.
There's none of them today.
He thinks the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
"People are getting together in a different way", he says.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people go regularly".
As for the churches, he's worried that the money from the sale of the property won't last as long as their leaders expect, and sooner or later they'll be right back where they started.
He adds that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments full of people of that type who do little to help the remaining shrines in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these houses will be white", he says, "which is why the day will soon come when these churches will close completely, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into the apartments will become church members".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin's ten years later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a black congregation whose services were held nearby.
St. Martin was taken over by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild it, they ordered a bell tower.
Reverend David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the bell-tower "the bells of the poor".
The expert panel that played the belvedere in July called it a "cultural treasure" and an "irreplaceable historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it is the first bell in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger church bell in Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says he was never replaced at St. Martin's.
In the last few months, there's been a complicated story at St. Martin's involving architects and builders, some of whom were called by lay church officials, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The Council of Elders, the parish governing body composed of lay representatives, sent a letter to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese would seek to pass costs onto the Council of Elders, even though it had not taken part in the hiring of architects and builders sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark has injured a 13-year-old boy in California who was diving for lobsters.
According to the official report, a shark on Saturday attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who was diving for lobster in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 this morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about a half hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help, and then paddled with the group to help him pull him out of the water.
Hammel stated that he first thought the cry was the joy of catching a lobster, but then he realized that it was the cry of "Kiss me!
He bit me!
When Hammel got to the boy, he noticed that he had a whole area of the clavicle torn.
'I shouted for everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' adds Hammel.
The boy was airlifted to the Children's Hospital Council in San Diego in critical condition.
It's unknown what kind of shark is behind the attack.
Marine Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that the shark had been sighted in the area several weeks ago, but it was determined to be a non-threatening species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities have closed for 48 hours access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for investigation and security.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered to be threatened.
Sainsbury's is planning to enter the cosmetics market in the UK
Sainsbury's is going to challenge Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with a department store-style cosmetics aisle, with specialty stores.
As part of a strong entry into the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow as fashion and home goods sales decline, beauty aisles will be tested at 11 stores across the country, and if successful, will be extended to more stores next year.
Investing in cosmetics is linked to the effort of supermarkets to find uses for shelves that were previously used for televisions, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury's says it will double the size of its cosmetics offering to 3,000 products and will, for the first time, include brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
More space will be given to existing assortments from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, thanks to branded locations similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also re-introducing its boutique makeup line, so most of the products will be vegan, which younger customers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, Saintsbury's will be testing the concession of the fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop in two stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, south London, and the next one this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the shift towards everyday small-scale food shopping in local stores means that supermarkets must do more to attract people.
Sainsbury's chief executive, Mike Coupe, says that stores will increasingly look like department stores as the chain of supermarkets tries to outperform discount retailers like Aldi and Lidl by offering better service and nonfood items.
Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos stores and also introduced a number of Habitat divisions, which are chains that it bought two years ago, and that has increased food sales and made acquisitions even more profitable.
A previous attempt to redecorate the supermarket's cosmetics and pharmaceutical department ended badly.
At the turn of the millennium, Sainsbury's was testing a joint venture with Boots, but the merger ended after a dispute over the distribution of the proceeds from the sale of pharmaceuticals in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Saintsbury's sold its 281 pharmacies three years ago for £125 million to Celesio, which owns the Lloyd's pharmacy chain.
Lloyds is expected to play its part in the plan by adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands to the four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Sainsbury's sales director, Paul Mills-Hicks, says: 'We have changed the look and feel of our cosmetics aisles to improve the environment for our customers.
We've also invested in specially trained colleagues that customers can consult.
Our range of brands should satisfy all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient location means that we now represent an attractive place to buy cosmetics that change old ways of shopping.
Peter Jones is "furious" after Holly Willoughby withdrew from her £11 million contract
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby resigned from his $11 million lifestyle contract to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home furnishings brand, Truly.
The couple's business has been compared to actress Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of the show announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has angered Dragons' Den star Peter Jones by leaving their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to insiders, Jones was furious when the TV star admitted at a tense Tuesday meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that new contracts worth up to £1.5million would mean he would no longer be able to devote enough time to their homewear and accessories brand Trula.
The business has been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and could double the wealth of presenter Willoughby to an estimated £11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving the Truly brand, Jones left Britain for one of his summer homes.
The unnamed source says, "The Trula badge was Holly's top priority.
It was to be her long-term future, to secure her for decades to come.
Her decision to leave was a shock to everyone involved.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
There's a warehouse full of goods at Marlow headquarters ready to be sold.
Experts believe the departure of the This Morning presenter, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions, given its heavy investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear, and the potential for further delay in the launch of the brand.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Mother of three, Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Tary Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
Couples go on vacations together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is set to become an M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his business dealings".
♪ Hard act ♪ ♪ And then we fell in love ♪
He joked about the criticism he's getting from journalists for a remark some deem "unworthy of the president" and for speaking positively of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump responded with his mockingly announcing voice.
♪ I've given up nothing ♪
He noted that after their first meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump hailed as a big step towards the denuclearization of North Korea, Kim is keen to meet again.
But the talks on eliminating nuclear weapons have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, prominent North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea sees no "appropriate response" from the US to its first steps toward disarmament.
Instead, the US continues to impose sanctions aimed at increasing pressure.
Trump expressed a more optimistic view in his speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea", he said.
We were on the brink of war with North Korea.
It would cost millions of lives.
We have a great relationship now.
His efforts to improve relations with Kim, he said, had yielded positive results  the termination of missile tests, assistance in the release of hostages, and the return of the remains of American soldiers to the homeland.
And he defended his unusual approach to reporting on Kim's relationship.
"It's so easy to act like a president, but instead of 10,000 people from the outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd have about 200 people standing right here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island and killed hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs learned that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is a necessary precondition for international aid to be rushed.
'Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not want international help, so it is a bit of a challenge,' says Ms Sumbung.
Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palau, but it's unclear if foreign staff will be allowed to work there.
A spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, Mr. Sutupo, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Paulo to see if international organizations would be allowed to help.
With earthquakes occurring so frequently in Indonesia, the country is still woefully unprepared for the wrath of Mother Nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, other parts of the coast are far from being built.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Paulo, even though warnings were issued, likely contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best of times, travel between many of Indonesia's islands is problematic.
And when natural disasters strike, the logistics are even more difficult.
A hospital ship that had been docked in Lombok to help earthquake victims is now moving to the city of Paulo, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
Improving Indonesia's poor infrastructure was a major campaign issue for President Joko Widodo, and the president spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
He'll be up for re-election next year, but his government is plagued by funding shortfalls.
President Joko is also facing pressure from the ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, with members of the Muslim majority embracing a more conservative form of faith.
Street fighting between Christians and Muslims, in which gangs use machetes, bows and arrows, and other primitive weapons, has already claimed the lives of over a thousand people and driven tens of thousands from their homes.
Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool has scored the equaliser against Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge scored in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, saving Liverpool from defeat by Chelsea in the Premier League.
Sturridge was given the pass by Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 yards from Chelsea's goal as his team lost 1-0.
He threw the ball to the left and fired at the far pole.
The shot was flying high and aimed at the top right corner of the gate.
The ball eventually leapt past a bouncing Kepa Arrizabalaga and ended up in the net.
"I was just trying to get in the right place to get the ball, and players like Shaq always play as far forward as possible, so I wanted to get as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming towards me, so I didn't think much about it and fired at one touch.
Chelsea took a 1-0 lead at half-time after a goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward passed the ball back to Mateo Kovacic, then turned around in the middle of the field and sprinted to half of Liverpool.
The pitcher passed the ball fast.
Then he threw the ball down a nice little lane to Hazard in the lime.
He ran off the defensive line and finished with a left to the far-off post next to Alison Becker of Liverpool.
At 3pm on Wednesday, Liverpool will take on the home team in the Champions League group at the San Paolo stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play Videoton in the UEFA European League on Thursday at 3pm in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
As of Sunday morning, the Indonesian Disaster Management Authority reported that the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami had risen to 832.
The 7.5-magnitude quake struck Friday, creating waves up to 6 meters high and trapping many people in the rubble of collapsed buildings, spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Paulo, with a population of over 380,000, was covered with debris.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing a woman
A woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning, and police have launched a murder investigation.
A 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7.55am at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are calling people in the area who saw or heard something to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan says: "The investigation is still in its early stages, but I would appeal to anyone who has been in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, whose onboard cameras may have recorded anything to contact us, as they may have information that is important to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the dead woman lived in Birkenhead and the body was found in the building.
Friends who think they know the woman have arrived at the scene this afternoon to ask where she was found this morning.
Police said they are investigating and are now informing the relatives of the victims.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to return to his apartment, but was told by police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
When he found out what had happened, he was speechless.
Residents have now been told that it will be several hours before they can return home.
One man was told by a police officer that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene, crying.
He keeps saying, "This is terrible".
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were behind the curb and another one was waiting outside.
There are a number of police officers in the restricted area, monitoring the house.
Anyone with information can send a message to @MerPolCC, call the 101 line or anonymously contact the Crimestoppers organization on 0800 555 111 and provide the code 247 of September 30.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament has recently become a hit because of the controversy over "rewriting history".
His expulsion would be a well-deserved punishment for his fanatical puritanical Taliban-style followers destroying many of England's cultural and religious artifacts.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal "foolish" and "an effort to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, says: 'In the current debate about the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster would become one of the targets.
Cromwell did not order or practice iconoclasm in the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the deeds of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent portrayal of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testament to the 19th century's belief and a piece of historiography of a character many still believe deserves to be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: 'Cromwell is seen by many people, although less so than in the late 19th century, as the defender of Parliament from outside pressure, in his case, of course, from the monarchy.
The accuracy of this interpretation is the subject of endless historical debate.
It is certain that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-identifiable figure who represents one side of that transformation.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and remembrance.
A killer pig has torn apart a Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southeast China.
As reported by the South China Morning Post on Sunday, the man, identified only by his last name, Yuan, was found dead with a severed artery in a pool of blood near a market in Liu-pchan-shue, Kuai-ch'ou Province.
A pig farmer prepares to administer the vaccine to pigs in a pig pen on 30 May 2005 in Si-ning, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly arrived with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found the door to the next cabin open.
He said there was a big pig in the barn with a mouth full of blood.
According to the information, the forensic examination confirmed that a 250-kilogram pig ripped apart the farmer.
"The cousin's legs were all bloody and torn", the Guiyang Evening News quoted the cousin, who is known by the surname "Wu".
Security camera footage shows Yuan coming to the market Thursday at 4:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousins.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been kept locked up so that no one else would notice while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Market officials are reportedly negotiating with Yuan's family for compensation for his death.
Although pig attacks on humans are rare, they have occurred in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, critically injuring the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig had dragged a Welsh farmer to his tractor, only to be driven away by the farmer's wife.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste for blood can act as a "trigger".
They're just playing.
They're curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to show them enough respect, he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rain to the southwestern United States .
Hurricane Rosa is forecast to weaken and move over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But in the next few days, it will bring flooding rains to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
At 5 a.m. Eastern time, Rosa had winds of 85 miles per hour, a category 1 hurricane, and was located about 400 miles southeast of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low pressure ridge is forming over the Pacific Ocean and moving eastward toward the west coast of the U.S. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, it will take the form of a tropical storm and begin to push tropical moisture northward into the southwestern U.S.
In some parts of Mexico, Rosa will bring up to 250 millimeters of rain on Monday.
Tropical moisture, with an approaching low pressure ridge, will bring heavy rain to the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rainfall of 25 to 100 mm locally will cause dangerous tidal floods, tidal currents and possible landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical moisture will cause precipitation to approach 50 to 75 millimeters per hour in places, especially southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some places in the southwestern United States, especially over most of Arizona, rainfall is expected to be between 50 and 100 millimeters.
Due to the diffuse nature of the tropical rain, flash flooding may occur in rapidly deteriorating conditions.
Considering the dangers of tropical rainfall, it would be unwise to venture into the desert on foot.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into raging rivers, and storms bring in local gusty winds and flying dust.
An approaching low pressure ridge will bring heavy localized precipitation to some parts of the southern California coast.
Overall collisions above 13 mm may occur, which could cause minor debris and slippery roadways.
It will be the first rainfall of the rainy season in this region.
On Sunday night and Monday morning, sporadic tropical overbursts will begin to approach Arizona, and on Monday night and Tuesday, rain will be widespread.
On Tuesday, heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners and continue through Wednesday.
In October, we can expect intense temperature changes across the U.S. as the Arctic begins to cool, but the tropics will still be fairly warm.
This sometimes leads to rapid temperature changes over short distances.
A great example of the extreme temperature differences is the central United States on a Sunday.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis, Iowa, and Des Moines, the difference is almost 11 degrees Celsius.
In the next few days, they will try to spread the warmth of summer.
Most of the central and eastern United States is expected to see a warm start to October with temperatures around 27 °C from the southern plains to parts of the northeastern United States.
In New York City, it could be 70 degrees on Tuesday, which is about six degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast indicates a high probability of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial was watched by over 20 million people
More than 20 million people watched Thursday's compelling testimony on six television networks from Supreme Court Justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault alleged to have occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political standoff continued as the newscasters interrupted the regular newscasts with a sudden twist Friday night: an agreement brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI would conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Christine Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had groped her drunk at a high school party and tried to take her clothes off.
In his excited testimony, Kavanaugh said he was 100% sure it didn't happen.
The event was likely watched by more than 20.4 million people, according to Nielsen.
The company calculated the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers for other stations that broadcast the depositions, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people watching in offices.
For comparison, that's the same number of viewers who watch football playoffs or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose anchors strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, had the highest viewership of all stations, with an average of 5.69 million viewers watching the day-long hearing, according to Nielsen.
The second was ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reports that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN was viewed by 2.52 million.
The interest continued after the end of the hearing.
The main character of Friday's drama was Senator Flake.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning caught him being yelled at by protesters as he was about to take the elevator to a judicial committee meeting.
CNN broadcast live as he stood for several minutes with his eyes closed and cursed.
One woman said, "I'm standing right in front of you".
"Do you think the country is telling the truth?"
He also heard: "You have power, while many women are powerless".
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and before the elevator doors closed, he said he would have more to say at the committee meeting.
All the cable and television networks later broadcast live when the Judiciary Committee was scheduled to vote on whether to submit Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote by the full Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so if the charges against the candidate were investigated by the FBI by next week, which the minority Democrats had demanded.
Flake was persuaded in part by interviews with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and a few other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's vote was important because it was clear that without an investigation, the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May has accused critics of "political correctness" on Brexit.
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "politicising" Britain's future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview that came close to the Prime Minister's front page, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson attacked her so-called Chequers plan, saying that the proposal for Britain and the EU to collect their tariffs from each other was "totally nonsensical".
Police have arrested Dython Simpson, suspected of killing an LSU player.
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU player.
The Baton Rouge Police Department says that Dyteon Simson, 20, has been arrested and booked on charges of second-degree murder.
Authorities released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to police, Sims lost his glasses in the fight.
According to WABF, which is owned by CBS, police recovered the glasses from the scene and found Simpson's DNA on them.
According to the police, Simpson confessed to shooting Wayde after he was questioned.
According to the defense attorney, bail was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the East Baton Rouge coroner's office released a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was gunshot wounds to the head and neck.
The department would like to thank the Louisiana State Refugee Police, the State Police Criminal Investigation Laboratory, Southern University Police, and the local community for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked local police officers for their efforts and commitment to justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning that Wayde's death shocked the team and shocked him.
"This is what you're always afraid of", Wade said.
A volcano spews ash on Mexico City
Ash from the Popacatépetl volcano has hit the southern suburbs of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the volcano's activity increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center has been monitoring a series of shocks and tremors.
Images of car windshields covered with a thin layer of ash have appeared on social media in some districts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have recorded an increase in activity at the volcano, which is located 72 kilometers (45 miles) southeast of the capital.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Before the anniversary of the independence vote, the police clashed with Catalan separatists
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the independence vote that divided Catalonia.
The security forces blocked a group of masked separatists who were throwing eggs and paint on them, which created a dark cloud of dust in the streets, which are usually flooded with tourists.
Later, clashes broke out, and police had to use batons to quell them.
Within hours, pro-independence groups chanted "We will not forget, we will not forgive" in the face of unionists protesting, who chanted "Long live Spain".
According to local press, 14 people were slightly injured in the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid considers illegal but which separatist Catalans are celebrating, tensions remain high in the region's pro-independence movement.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence, but turnout was low because opponents of secession boycotted the elections.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in violent clashes across the region.
Pro-independence groups stayed outside all night Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration did take place, but it had to take a different route.
Eighty-six-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped for independence for Catalonia.
We had some of the best times last year.
My parents were crying with joy that they could vote, but now we're at an impasse, he said.
Despite a significant, if narrow victory in regional elections last December, pro-independence Catalan parties have struggled to keep things going this year, with many of their most prominent leaders either going into exile themselves or in detention awaiting trial for their part in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
A 42-year-old assembler, Joan Puig, recorded a protest in support of the police on his phone, and says that the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is becoming more tense", he adds.
Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in jail since late last year awaiting trial, announced on Saturday that he will run for the European Parliament next year.
Candidating for the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and the repression that we are witnessing from the Spanish government,he said.
Londonderry: Men trapped after car crashes into house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after being repeatedly run over by a car in a house in Londonderry.
The incident happened at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 7:30 p.m. local time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings reports that there was damage to the gate and the house itself.
At one point, the car may have been shot out of the crossbow.
Meng's shot ensured a 1-0 win for Livingstone over the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensured the victory
Livingston, who had moved up from the lower division, shocked the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his second defeat in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Meng's shot proved decisive as Gary Holt's team reached Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side have yet to win a Premiership game at home this season and next Sunday they will face Hearts, who are eight points behind.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston has extended his unbeaten streak in the division to six games, leaving head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, with a losing record.
Livingston didn't take his chances against the unassuming guests.
Holt's team should have been in the lead long before the goal, because his directness caused the Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson got through the defence, but missed the goal, then Alan Lithgow slipped just short of Craig Halkett's head in front of the goal.
The home team had to watch the Rangers play in front of them because they knew they could annoy the guests with the standard situations.
And so came the key goal.
Against the Rangers, a free kick was called and Livingston made a hole, Declan Gallagher and Robinson together sent off Mengu, who dribbled the ball into the centre of the penalty area and scored.
At this point, the Rangers were dominating the ball, but the home defense was impenetrable to them, and goalie Liam Kelly was mostly out of work.
The same pattern was seen in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to intervene.
Scott Pittman stopped the legs of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow missed from another standard Livingston situation.
Centres were constantly flying into Livingston's penalty area, which the players were continually clearing, and two penalty kicks were thrown in vain after Halkett's attack on substitute Glenn Middleton and another hand.
The Livingston phenomenon is the analysis of the
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They have been without exception excellent and continue to exceed expectations on their way up.
Their style of play and team have barely changed since they returned to the top, but great credit goes to Holt for the way he's been building the team since he arrived.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was formidable, leading a well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on alert the entire time.
The Rangers are lacking inspiration.
They used to be good under Gerrard, but they don't meet those standards anymore.
Their end was weak - they only got one run at home - and it should be a wake-up call for the Rangers, because they're in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received a mixed reception in Cologne
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday, the sky was blue and everyone was smiling.
It's the final day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at repairing relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed over a range of issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne, where he opened a huge new mosque.
This city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police had prevented the 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters showed up in the area wanting to see their president.
Hundreds of people were also heard - many of them Kurds - protesting against Erdogan, condemning his policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The counter-protests reflect the controversy of the visitor, who was hailed as a hero by some German Turks and cursed by others as an autocrat.
Deptford accident: Cyclist killed after collision with car
A cyclist has died after being hit by a car in London.
The accident occurred at approximately 10:15 a.m. local time near the intersection of Bestwood Street and busy Evelyn Street in Deptford, southeast of the city.
The driver stopped the car and an ambulance soon arrived, but the man was dead on the spot.
The death comes just months after another cyclist died about a mile from the scene of Saturday's tragedy in a hit-and-run accident on Childers Street.
The Metropolitan Police said officers are now trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
The highway is closed, buses are operating on alternate routes, and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards were injured in riots
According to the Bureau of Prisons, six guards were injured in the riot at the high-security men's prison.
Riots broke out at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday around 9:30 local time and are still ongoing.
Specialist guards from the Tornado Team were called in to deal with the riots, involving eight inmates in one wing.
The guards suffered minor injuries and were treated at the scene.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specialised trained prison staff have been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend longer periods behind bars.
Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was announced that the prison director had been terminated after an inmate was attacked in the hospital.
And last October, the prison was called in by the police for a major riot in which the staff were attacked with a ball of marbles.
Hurricane Rosa threatens to flood Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (rainfall where dry can benefit)
It's not unusual for a tropical low pressure ridge to hit Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early next week, as the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa overwhelms the desert southwest, bringing the risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including cities like Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to make a direct route through Phoenix on Tuesday and bring rain on Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that since 1950, only 10 tropical cyclones within 200 miles of Phoenix have maintained tropical storm status or lower!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict rainfall of 50 to 100 millimeters, with up to 150 millimeters in the Mogollon Rim area of Arizona.
In other areas of the desert northwest, including the center of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, falls are likely to be 25 to 50 mm, with local totals as high as 100 mm.
For those who are not at risk of flooding, the Rosy Rain may be a blessing, as the area has been hit by a drought.
Floods are a very serious thing, but these rains might help somewhere, because the southwest of the United States has just been hit by a drought.
According to weather.com, U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona is experiencing at least one extreme drought, the second highest category.
Hurricane Rosa's path will first take it to the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still a hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 85 miles per hour, will be at 400 miles per hour south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, on Sunday morning and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
Then the storm encounters the cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean, and thus loses strength.
It's expected to reach Mexico by Monday afternoon or evening as a tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico, the rainfall will be heavy, posing a high risk of flooding.
Rainfall totals of 75 to 150 millimeters are expected in the region from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with up to 250 millimeters of rainfall possible, according to weather.com.
Rosa will then travel northward as a tropical storm through Mexico and reach the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday, then pass through Arizona and enter southern Utah late on Tuesday.
"The main hazard for Rosa or its remnants is expected to be very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the desert southwest of the United States", reports the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to cause deadly flash floods and mudflows in deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a man in his 20s have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
An injured boy was found in the area of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at approximately 4:00 local time.
He was taken to the hospital and is now in stable condition.
As Avon and Somerset police have reported, young men between the ages of 17 and 20 were arrested in the Radstock area overnight.
Police are looking for witnesses who may have a cell phone recording of what happened.
Trump says Kavanaugh has eaten the wickedness and the wrath of the Democratic Party.
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is a rejection of the ruthless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump claimed that Kavanaugh had been subjected to the malice and fury of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he strongly and emotionally denied allegations that Christine Blasey Ford sexually assaulted him when they were teenagers decades ago.
Ford also testified at the arraignment hearing.
The president said Saturday that the American people had witnessed Kavanaugh's brilliance and quality and courage.
He told a delegation of his West Virginia supporters that the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation of one of the greatest legal minds of our time, a lawyer who has a record of outstanding public service.
The president was indirectly referring to Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about how important it is for Republicans to run in midterm elections.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm always on the move, he said.
That's why I fight for the best candidates everywhere.
Trump said the Democrats have decided to go for "resistance and obstruction".
A senior Republican Party official told CNN that the first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination on the Senate floor is expected no later than Friday.
Hundreds killed in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia and casualty numbers continue to rise
Authorities announced on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed after a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, many of them swept away by huge waves that flooded beaches.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach in the city of Palu for the festival on Friday, but at dusk, waves up to 20 feet [6 m] high hit the coast, killing many and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami wave was preceded by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people were still doing their jobs on the beach and did not run away, so they were killed by the waves", said spokesman for the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency BNPB Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami wave didn't come alone, it took cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on the ground", said Nugroho, adding that before hitting the coast, the tsunami wave on the open sea was spreading at 800 km/h.
He said that some people escaped the wave to the trees and survived.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the Disaster Mitigation Agency show many destroyed buildings and businesses, twisted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftermath shook the coastal town on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Bureau of Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's powerful quake was about 200 times greater than the force of the World War II atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.
The city lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, which could have made the tsunami wave even bigger.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
He mentioned that some of the victims' bodies were found trapped under the debris of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho reported that the number of casualties and damage could be greater on the coast 300 km north of Pala, in an area called Donggala, which is close to the epicenter of the earthquake.
According to him, communication was completely cut off without any information from Donggala.
The Red Cross said in a statement that more than 300,000 people live in the area, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it could get much worse", the statement said.
The agency was criticized on Saturday for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palau, even though authorities said the waves came at the time the warning was issued.
Amateur footage shared on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building with a desperate cry warning people on the street of the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, carrying away buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to verify the recording immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive power outage that cut communications in the Palu area, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Authorities say the military has begun sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuees are still in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has been reopened for aid transport only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation center in Palau on Saturday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
That's too bad.
When World Vision staff from Donggala arrived in the city of Paulo, where workers are hiding in shelters made of clay in the courtyard of an office building, they saw images of destruction on the way, says Mr. Doseba.
"They said they saw a lot of houses destroyed", he adds.
It's too bad.
When the relief teams embarked on their sad work of disaster relief, some of them complained that foreign workers with extensive experience were not allowed to come to Paulo.
Under Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies, and personnel can only be brought to the site when a national disaster zone is declared.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a provincial disaster", says Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says, "OK, this is a national disaster", we can start international aid, but it's not like that yet.
As the second night of the earthquake and tsunami in Paula began, friends and relatives of those still missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that would ease the grim stories of natural disasters.
They pulled a little boy out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under debris for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, was training two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended in Indonesia this month.
Other people trapped in Roa Roa's hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As someone who has been paragliding for a long time, I have my own emotional burden", he says.
Mr. Gendon described how in the hours after the paragliding community learned of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse, he desperately sent messages via WhatsApp to the competitors from Palu who were attending the beach festival.
But instead of two blue check marks, his reports ended with a gray mark.
"I think it means the messages weren't delivered", he says.
Thieves took $26,750 during an ATM restock in Newport on the Levee.
According to a news release from the Newport Police Department, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee while he was refilling an ATM in Newport on the Levee on Friday morning.
As Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report, the driver of the car was emptying an ATM at the entertainment complex and was preparing to deposit more money into it.
While he was doing so, another man ran behind the Brink's employee and stole a bag of money to be put into the ATM.
Witnesses reported seeing several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved.
Any information on the identity of the suspects, please report to Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name from "Y" to "Ye".
He announced the change on Saturday on Twitter, writing: "Being formally known as Kanye West".
The 41-year-old West has been nicknamed "Ye" for some time, and used the pseudonym as the title of his eighth album, which came out in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he's set to debut his new album Yandhi.
She will be replacing Ariana Grande, who pulled out of the show for emotional reasons, according to the show's creator.
West has previously said that the word has religious significance for him, in addition to shortening the existing professional name.
In my opinion, "Ye" is the most used word in the Bible, where "Ye" means "We", West was heard talking about his album to the radio host Big Boy earlier this year.
So it's you, it's us, it's us.
It's gone from Kanye, which means the one, to just Ye  as a mere reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is such a reflection of who we are,
A number of other famous rappers have also changed their names.
Sean Combs has been known at various times as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former collaborator JAY-Z also alternated his name with and without hyphen and with both upper and lower case letters.
Mexican President AMLO has promised not to use the military against civilians
On the approach of the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students, newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has pledged never to use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador on Saturday in Tlatelolco Plaza promised that he would never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.
As the left-wing student movement spread throughout Latin America, soldiers opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in a square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by paying monthly stipends to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of education opportunities are drawing young people into gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding for artificial intelligence
According to Kai-Fu Lee, an AI investor and expert who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and the US should double the amount it spends on AI research.
The comments come after various parts of the US government released statements on AI, even though the US as a whole has no formal strategy for AI.
Meanwhile, China launched a plan last year to become the leader in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are way ahead of the US and we're looking for another breakthrough in AI", Lee says.
Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week that doubling funding could double the chance that the next big AI discovery will be made in the US.
Lee, who this month published his book "Superpower AI: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" with Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that beat the best American player in the game Othello, and later he was the head of research at Microsoft and president of Google's Chinese subsidiary.
Lee praised previous US government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when would be the next to help identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee says.
"Academic excellence is not led by China, but by corporations", says Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have been hiring the best university scientists to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could help the United States improve its efforts in AI.
"I think that PhD holders in AI should automatically be offered green cards", he says.
The State Council of China released the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The China National Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way that the National Science Council and other government organizations give money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is worse in China, Lee says.
The US Department of Defense this year established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence to engage with industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the creation of an AI Selection Board.
And DARPA announced this month that it's investing $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it now invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
But the U.S. legislature, which wanted to create a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence, has not acted for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the country's name
Macedonians voted Sunday in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has blocked applications for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia, and claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory, and therefore has vetoed Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
Both governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will weaken the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a campaign calling for a boycott has raised doubts about whether the required minimum of 50 percent of voters will turn out to make the referendum valid.
The question in the referendum was: 'Are you for NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of an agreement with Greece?'
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the successor countries of the former Yugoslavia, to join organizations such as the EU and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia to live freely under the roof of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us", says 79-year-old Oliver Georgijevska from Skopje.
The referendum is not binding, but enough members of Parliament have said they will follow the result of the vote.
Changing the name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission said there were no reports of any problems until 1 p.m.
However, the voter turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters eventually cast their ballots.
I went to vote for my children, our place is in Europe, says Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their votes in the Macedonian referendum on changing the name that would open the country to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small podium and pulls up chairs in front of tents erected by people boycotting the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter them with our heads held high, not through the door for the servants", says Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have our pride.
If they don't want us to be like Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Eurasian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I think a large majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", Zaev said after voting.
The result of the election, he said, would be "a confirmation of our future".
According to a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, the turnout for the referendum could be between 30 and 43 percent of voters - which is less than the required turnout.
Another survey, conducted by the Macedonian broadcaster Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70% said they would vote yes.
For a referendum to be successful, it needs to be 50 percent plus one voter.
The referendum's failure would mark the first major blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it took office last May.
Watch this: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero has gone through the Brighton defence to score.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took out Brighton's defence on Saturday, securing a 2-0 win for Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
On Aguero's serve, his 65th-minute goal looked ridiculously easy.
It all started with a pass by an Argentine striker in the middle of the field.
He sprinted through three of Brighton's defenders and into the open space.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
On the edge of Brighton's penalty area, he bypassed one defender and overtook a few others.
And with the next left, he found Sterling.
The English striker passed the ball in the penalty area back to Aguer, who with his right hand overtook Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a shot to the right of the net.
"Aguero has been suffering from a foot problem", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We thought he'd play 55 or 60 minutes.
And that was it.
We were lucky he scored at that moment.
The opening lead for the Sky Blues in this Premier League match has been provided by Sterling.
This goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton's court.
On the left side, he threw a beautiful ball to Leroy Sane.
Sane took the ball and then sent Sterling to the far-off post.
The Sky Blues forward dropped the ball into the net just before he slipped off the field.
City will play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany, on Tuesday at 12:55pm.
Scherzer wants to spoil the Rockies ' fun
When the Nationals were eliminated from playoff contention, there wasn't much reason to re-enter.
But ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to pitch against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday... but only if the Rockies, who lead the NL West by one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers... have a chance to make the playoffs.
The Rockies at least got a wild card on Friday night with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals, but they're still looking to win their first division title.
Even if we're not playing for anything, we can at least get started, because the atmosphere here in Denver is amazing, and the other team is going to play with probably the most effort I've seen this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play it?
The Nationals have not yet announced who will start Sunday, but they are reportedly leaning toward kicking Scherzer out of the game.
For Scherzer, it would be his 34th start, training on Thursday and pitching on Sunday, when he's usually off.
The right-handed pitcher for Washington is 18-7 this season with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump speaks at a rally in West Virginia
The president made a slight comment on the situation surrounding his nominee for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke about the importance of Republicans running in midterm elections.
In November, everything we've done will be at stake.
We have five weeks left to make one of the most important choices of our lives.
He's one of the big, big ones. "I'm not running, but we're always on the move and I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere", he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they're determined to take power by any means necessary, you see the depravity, the ugliness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to overpower to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we're not going to give it to them.
He said the Democrats have opted for "resistance and obstruction".
"And you see it in the last four days", he added, "he said the Democrats are "crazy and evil and nasty and lying".
He named the longest-serving member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which led to a loud roar from the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you take the document out?
Uh, what?
No, uh, no, wait, that was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer a diverse current of opinion.
Intolerant of those who express their views
When the activists from Momenta in my local party voted for my admonishment, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of Labour MPs who have been told they are not welcome because they have honestly expressed their views.
My colleague in the House, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way because she stood up strongly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, paradoxically, on the same issues that Jeremy disagreed with the previous leaders.
The announcement for Friday's Nottingham East Labour Party meeting said we wanted the meetings to be accessible and productive.
For most of the eight years I was a Labour MP, the GC on a Friday night was exactly like this.
Unfortunately, most meetings today are not, and the promise of a more polite, friendly politics has long been forgotten, if ever started.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that every view is judged to be acceptable to the party leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, and colleagues who I had previously thought shared similar political views suddenly expected me to turn 180 degrees and take positions I could not otherwise agree with, whether it was national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public - and it doesn't matter what I say - there's a barrage of social media abuse, calling for my resignation, condemning the politics of the Centre, and telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments aimed at me are usually political.
I have great respect for the professionalism and dedication of those colleagues who face a barrage of sexist or racist abuse every day, but never back down.
One of the aspects of this era's politics that I'm most disappointed in is how insulting has become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer that diverse stream of opinion, and with each motion of no confidence or change of the selection rules, the party becomes more limited.
I've been told many times over the last two years to keep my distance, not to speak so much, and then I'll be fine.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a schoolboy 32 years ago, provoked by the neglect of Margaret Thatcher's government, which had left my classroom in the public schools literally falling apart, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need them most - whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been surprised by my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who supported the motion on Friday, I would just say that as the country proceeds towards Brexit, which will damage households, businesses and our public services, I cannot bear the temptation to waste my time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But my main message, not to the Nottingham Moment, but to my constituents, whether they're members of the Labour Party or not, is that I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of impeachment or political pragmatism will deter me from acting in what I believe is in the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38  17 Melrose: The undefeated Ayr climbs to the top
Two late fives may have skewed the final score a bit, but there's no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderfully entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
Now they're at the top of the charts, the only undefeated.
In the end, it was the defensive excellence and the better use of chances that helped the home team to victory, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be pleased.
"In our matches we have gone through great trials and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy", he says.
Robyn Christie from Melrose says, "All credit to Ayr, they took the chance better than we did".
A five from Grant Anderson in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climet, sent Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scotland international Rory Hughes, who was released by the Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical advantage and Jason Baggot gained an unchanged five.
Climo increased Ayr's lead on a penalty and then scored at halftime and turned the solo attempt so he adjusted it to 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's five, transformed into Baggot, cut the lead to five points.
Then came a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who left the field on a stretcher, and when the game resumed, Ayr again jumped with a Stafford McDowall five converted by Climo.
Ayru's alternate captain Blair Macpherson was given a yellow card and Melrose again used the extra man thanks to an unchanged five from Bruce Colvin after a short, hard press.
The home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow for attacking Clima without the ball, MacPherson from the penalty box put the ball behind the advancing maul of Ayru.
Climo turned, again almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's kick and sent Gregor Henry's wing to the fifth home run.
The star of Still Game is starting a new career in hospitality.
It seems that Still Game star Ford Kieran is moving into the hospitality industry, as it has been revealed that he has been named CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes and stars in alongside long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the final season of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craigslist.
According to the official records, he's the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the report, but a source close to the Scottish Sun has suggested that Kiernan is looking to get involved in a "thriving restaurant business" in Glasgow.
'The Sea is Ours': Inland Bolivia hopes court reopens the road to the Pacific
Marines are patrolling outside the naval headquarters in La Paz, which is decorated with ropes.
The blue flag of the ocean is flying over public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are described by the slogan: "The sea is our right.
It's our duty to get him.
Throughout the Bolivian hinterland, there is a living memory of the coastline that the country lost to Chile in the bloody 19th-century resource wars, as well as the desire to re-invent the Pacific Ocean.
These are perhaps the greatest yearnings in decades, as Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice, which is due to fall on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has energy, a spirit of unity and calm and of course it expects a positive result", says Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will be watching the ruling of the MSD on big screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim that after many decades of interrupted talks Chile is obligated to negotiate that Bolivia be granted sovereign access to the sea.
Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president Evo Morales, who faces a controversial re-election battle next year, also has a keen interest in Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he said in late August.
But some analysts believe it's unlikely the court will rule in favor of Bolivia, and even if it did, little would change.
The UN body, based in the Netherlands, has no power to assign Chilean territory to anyone and has said it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the MSD decision comes just six months after the last arguments were made shows that the case was "not complicated", as Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law, says.
And the last four years have not only not supported the cause of Bolivia, but may have actually slowed it down.
"The questions of access to the sea have been taken over by the current Bolivian government", Zárate says.
He adds that Morales' offensive rhetoric has weakened any remaining goodwill in Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually start to talk again, but after this, it will be extremely difficult to have a discussion.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, dismissed the idea that the court's decision was unusually swift.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a unique opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile and a chance to end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - would use the sea issue as a political crutch.
Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean, he added.
The verdict is an opportunity to find out that we need to deal with the past.
North Korea says it will not go nuclear unless it can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made at the leaders' summit of the two rivals in Singapore.
His comments come as it appears that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is set to restart nuclear diplomacy, which has been stalled for more than three months, for a Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says he is "burning with hope" that continued sanctions and U.S. objections to the declaration ending the Korean War could one day bring the North to its knees.
Washington is cautious about approving the declaration unless Pyongyang first takes significant steps to disarm.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up this arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo wants to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris shows show that the latest trend of giant head coverings will soon be coming to your fashion stores.
If you want to expand your hat collection or block out the sun altogether, your search is over.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of stunningly large headdresses for their spring/summer 2019 collection at a show that captivated everyone at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have put their exciting creations on the map.
Valentino's showpiece was an exaggerated beige hat with a wide brim reminiscent of feathers that flooded the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories were the ornate watermelon, the witch's hat, and even the pineapple - but they were not meant to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a selection of bizarre masks... and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks have sewn lips and resemble Hannibal Lecter rather than high fashion.
One of the creations resembled diving equipment, including a snorkel and goggles, while the other looked like a cornucopia with melted ice cream.
And if you continue to go with the big fashion, you're in luck.
Fashion experts predict that giant caps may even be making their way into fashion stores.
The overgrown hats come after "La Bomba", the half-metre wide straw hat worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind this very impractical hat that has flooded social media has sent another giant creation - a straw-on beach bag that's almost as big as the swimsuit model who wears it - to the show floor.
The dark orange raffian bag with its white leather handle and edged with raffian ribbons was the showpiece of the La Riviera spring/summer 2019 collection by Jacquemus at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: I expect big hats and beach bags to appear in fashion stores for next summer Given that the designer has had such great success with them, it would be hard to ignore the demand for overly large accessories.
John Edwards: Language skills are a must for global citizens
Scottish Independent Schools have a history of academic success, and this continues in 2018 with further excellent exam results, as individual and group achievements in sports, arts, music and other community activities underline this.
These schools, with over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, are represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) and strive to provide the best possible service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers, and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement individually tailored school curricula, we observe that modern languages are increasingly popular and in-demand subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes straight to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes straight to his heart.
The important point is that if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries, we can't rely on English alone.
The latest results from this year's examinations show that languages are at the top of the charts, with the independent schools not having the highest success rate.
A total of 68 percent of the students who took the foreign language course received the highest grades.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools show that 72 percent of Mandarin students, 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students, and 63 percent of Spanish students achieved the highest grade of A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as an important skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as subjects of choice are given the same weight as STEM subjects in the curricula of independent and other schools.
A survey carried out by the UK's Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that 17 per cent of the reasons given by employers as being difficult to fill vacancies were due to insufficient language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly becoming a necessity in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more jobs require languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Whatever career you choose, if you learn a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future, having a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically gives a multilingual person an advantage over his or her competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent of them could not speak a foreign language well enough to carry on a conversation, with the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage of people, specifically 15 percent, being French.
That's why it's important for kids today to invest in language learning.
If children know more languages, especially those of emerging economies, they will have a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school differs in the languages it teaches.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages considered most important for the UK in the 2020 outlook, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the child's interests, he or she will always have a choice of several languages in independent schools with teachers who are experts in the field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares and equips children with the skills they need to succeed, whatever their future may hold.
At the moment, it is undeniable that languages are essential to the future of the country in a global business environment, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be considered as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It's got to be done.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Independent Schools Council.
LeBron is going to San Diego on Sunday for his first Lakers game.
Fans eager to see LeBron James play for the first time for the Los Angeles Lakers will soon be eager to see him.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opener in San Diego against the Denver Nuggets.
But it's not clear how many minutes he'll play.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play a limited number of minutes.
Last week after practice, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six preseason games.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season games", he said.
Trump's performance in West Virginia, the YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will launch a wave of campaign speeches tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five meetings scheduled for next week, including stops in friendly locations like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the suspension of the vote to confirm his nominee for the vacant Supreme Court seat, Trump is looking to win support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing Congress in the November election.
What time is Trump's performance tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. eastern time, today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally online below via YouTube live.
Trump is likely to speak about the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's hearing this week, which was highly charged over allegations of sexual misconduct, and is expected to delay the Senate confirmation vote for a week before the FBI investigation.
But the main purpose of this wave of rallies is to help the Republicans pick up the pace before the November election.
According to Reuters, organizers of the Trump campaign say the five rallies next week are meant to "energize volunteers and supporters so Republicans can try to protect and expand the majorities they have in the Senate and House of Representatives".
"Control of the Senate is so important to his agenda that the president will be traveling to as many states as possible in this busy campaign season", a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named told Reuters.
According to West Virginia Metro News, the Wheeling Wesbank Arena rally could draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and could be followed by the Pittsburgh media.
On Saturday, it will be the second time in the last month that Trump visits West Virginia, where he won over 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has to come to help him with his investigations", says Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA has shown it has the stomach to fight to keep its hopes alive ahead of Sunday's singles
After three one-sided matches, Saturday's pairings may be just what the Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum is a completely invented sporting concept, but the players really believe in it, and especially in competitions like this.
So where's the swing going to go now?
"They're down six points and now they're down four, so we're going to assume that the pendulum is moving a little bit towards us", Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, leading by four points with 12 to play.
As Spieth says, Americans feel they have a little bit of wind in their sails, and there are many things that can cheer them up, like Spieth's form and Justin Thomas's, who played together all day and each can boast three points out of four.
Spieth was deadly on the way from the tee to the green and he's leading by example.
The celebratory screams were heightened as he continued his round, when he managed a key pat to win the whole match, as he and Thomas were two holes behind.
His putt, which won them a 15-hole match, was met with a similar roar that tells you the American team is not out yet.
"You really had to go deep and take care of your own fight", Spieth said.
That's all each of these players left behind.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, arguably the main story of the Ryder Cup.
Weird but adorable couple from Europe, four of a kind, and they can do no wrong.
"Moliwood was the only pair to miss a hole on a Saturday afternoon, "but also missed a hole on a Saturday morning,
The course and the way the energy is flowing both towards the thundering crowd and from him confirms that these are the players destined for Sunday's victory, and that by sunset over Le Golf Naitional there will be no player more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time on a different hole.
But talk of European glory is premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly teamed up with Serge Garcia, the hero of the morning's Four Balls, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A hole and two doubles on the front nine buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a chasm from which they never climbed.
But on Sunday, no one will help you.
Two-player games are so fascinating when you get a close look at the interactions of the people in the pair, the advice they give each other, the advice they don't give each other, and the way that strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team, taking a big lead until the final day, but the two-way match also showed that the U.S. team has the stomach for a fight that some, especially from the states, doubted.
As the final day of the Ryder Cup draws to a close, Europe leads 10-6
Europe will have a healthy lead going into the final day of the Ryder Cup after taking a 10-6 lead over the United States in Saturday's double-header.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who reportedly nearly won twice over wrestler Tiger Woods, set out to make four cuts at Le Golf National.
The European side with Thomas Bjorn, who decided two years ago to keep the trophy they lost in Hazeltine, dominated in the morning's two-ball game with the American side, who failed to win the series 3-1.
The U.S. showed more resistance in the four, winning two matches, but could not get into the deficit.
Jim Fury's side need eight points from Sunday's 12 games to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four straight points, while he and Molinari, who earned the nickname "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to win four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in a two-ball game, they beat tired Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau even more forcefully 5&4.
Woods, who lasted two games on Saturday, showed occasional flashes of brilliance, but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in doubles on two balls and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested after this morning's two-ball game, returns to partner Henrik Stenson in the two-man game to beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and number three in the world rankings.
Europe was not to be had on this pleasant, fresh day southwest of Paris.
Three-time major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas took two points for the Americans on Saturday.
They took a tough 2&1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the two-ball game and came back later to beat the Poulter pair and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the pair game, despite losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point deficit to win a game, although as defending champions Furyk's side need only draw to claim the trophy.
After the second day's best in two days, it looks like Sunday's counterattack is behind them.
North Korea says it will not disarm unilaterally or without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister said Saturday that the continuing U.N. sanctions have deepened their mistrust of the United States and that under such circumstances the country will never give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told his annual general assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test sites, and pledging not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
We do not see a corresponding response from the US,he said.
"Without trust in the U.S., there can be no trust in our national security, and under these circumstances, there can be no unilateral disarmament".
While Ri echoed North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a "step-by-step" approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for each step, his statement appeared significant in that he did not reject unilateral denuclearization out of hand because Pyongyang has gone through it in the past.
Ri mentioned the joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to work towards the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees for the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-1953 war conflict, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The US is insisting on "denuclearisation first" and is increasing pressure on sanctions to achieve its goals, even objecting to "declaring the end of the war", Ri said.
The notion that sanctions can bring us to our knees is the dream of people who don't know anything about us.
The problem is that the continued sanctions are deepening our mistrust.
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the American leader highlighted at the UN earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted Kim's three meetings with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, adding: "If the side on the denuclearization issue had been South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a stalemate".
However, Ri's tone was dramatically different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's missile targeting of the US was inevitable after the evil President Trump branded Kim as "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
At the UN this year, Trump, who last year threatened "total destruction" of North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said much more work needed to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea is completely denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it, stating, "If it takes two years, three years, or five months - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia are insisting that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
But US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: Enforcement of the Security Council's sanctions must continue vigorously and without pause until we achieve complete, final, verified denuclearization
The Security Council has unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to curb the funding of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo and Ri met at the UN General Assembly on the sidelines, and Pompeo said he would visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't end well.
He left Pyongyang in July and claimed progress had been made, only for North Korea to declare him "gangster-like" within hours.
North Korea has pledged to meet with Moon this month to dismantle the missile site and also the nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He said Kim told him that the "corresponding measures" he hoped for were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course to teach them how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has forced all of its students to get more sleep in an effort to combat the growing culture of macho students staying up all night and getting high on caffeine.
Academics have found that students at the world's most prestigious universities are often helpless when it comes to the basics of self-care.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end, a girl came up to me and said, "Why are you telling me this now, in my senior year?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me, she told The Telegraph.
The course, which was introduced for the first time this year, provides students with basic information on how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance and improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university's executive director of health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students were really severely sleep deprived during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there's a picture of student halls where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, and books about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep and the importance of good sleep habits.
Another section tells participants how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons then invites participants to reflect on their daily routines.
We know that student behavior doesn't change immediately.
But we think they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know about the health effects of cigarette smoking,' added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in "studying all night" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was also a growing problem.
Getting good quality sleep should be a student's secret weapon to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to prevent weight gain, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in a starvation mode, so you're always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemical and physical biology student from California, helped Professor Czeisler design a course that one of his Harvard freshman classes took last year.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push for the whole course.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar degree program before entering a competitive institution.
The professor advised the students to consider setting their alarm for bedtime as well as waking time, and to be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm, leading to sleeping problems.
The Rangers 1-0 by Livingston:
The Rangers suffered another loss as Dolly Menga's shot cemented Steven Gerrard's displeasure with a 1-0 defeat at Livingstone.
The Ibrox side were looking to record their first win since the 4-1 February triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side caused only Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his post eight points clear of the top-ranked Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Menga struck seven minutes into the half and the Rangers' lineup seemed to lack the inspiration and determination to make up the score.
While Rangers are now down to sixth, Livingston is climbing to third and just behind Hibernian by one goal.
And it could be another problem for the Rangers after linebacker Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after apparently being hit by an object from the stands.
Gerrard made eight changes to his side, which bounced past Ayr to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Livi 11 that took Hearts to the point last week and would have been delighted to see his well-trained squad smother their opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have dominated the possession, but Livingston did more with the ball on their side.
They were only two minutes into the game when Menga first put Scott Pittman on the Alan McGregor goal, but the midfielder buried his big chance.
Keaghan Jacobs' long free kick then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only make a pass at the back post.
The Rangers took control, but it seemed like there was more hope than faith in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have had a quarter-hour penalty when he collided with Steven Lawless, but the referee, Steven Thomson, swept the Colombian challenge off the table.
Rangers managed just two shots on target in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was surprised by a header from Lassana Couliballa and a soft shot from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's 34-minute opener may have been against the running of the game, no one can deny that they've earned it for all the hard work.
The Rangers have again failed to deal with Jacobs' deep set.
Scott Arfield was unresponsive when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who was calm and took the ball to Mengu for an easy finish.
Gerrard took action at the break and traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange was almost instantaneous as the wing crashed into Morelos, but the imposing Kelly fought his way through the line and blocked the attack.
But Livingston continued to draw the visitors into the game of the kind they like, with Lithgow and Halkett throwing long balls one after the other.
Holt's side could have extended their lead in the closing stages, but McGregor stood well to block Jacobs before Litgow ran out of the corner.
Rangers alternate Glenn Middleton had another late penalty when he got into a scuffle with Jacobs, but Thomson turned again.
Almanach: The Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our almanac: "Sunday morning", September 30, 1882, today it is 136 years, and still growing... the day when in Germany was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger reader.
The Geiger Counter became a pop culture staple, as in the 1950 film The Bells of Coronado, starring the seemingly unlikely scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in the world is this?"
It's a Geiger counter that's used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms being emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Oh, yeah, now it's really popping!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to recognize dangerous cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see dangerous cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous cells as part of the treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and converting them in the lab
Then they can see a protein that's common to many cancers, and then they're injected again
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with multiple types of cancer.
One woman who received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous cells had her ovarian cancer gone for over 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, converting them in the laboratory so they can see a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then re-applying it to the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have developed a very promising vaccine".
HER2 is involved in the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach, where immune cells are taken from patients and trained to target cancer cells, has already been used to treat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West attended a pro-Trump sermon, wearing his mag hat, after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go very well.
Kanye West was booed at Saturday Night Live after a confusing performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After singing the third song that night, "Ghost Town", in which he wore a Make America Great Again hat, he began to spit at Democrats and reiterated his support for President Trump.
I often talk to white people and they say, "How can you like Trump if he's a racist?"
If I was a racist, I wouldn't be in America, he said.
SNL has started the show with a Matt Damon-starring parody in which the Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the allegations of the rape of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, footage of West's theatrical speech was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to make fun of West.
West also complained to the audience that his head ornament got eaten up pretty good backstage.
I was bullied backstage.
They said, "Don't go in there with that hat".
This is bullying!
They also said I was in the wrong place, he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "You want to see the wrong place?" and added that he would "put on my Superman suit, because that means you can't tell me what to do". "You want the world to move forward?"
Try love.
His comments only earned him a buzzing audience at least twice, and the members of SNL looked scandalized, embarrassed, Variety says, and one person even said, "The whole studio just went silent".
West was brought in as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many by singing "I Love" disguised as a bottle of Perrier water.
West was backed by the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest characters: THANK YOU FOR BEING A CASE".
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West "was just who he is, and that's absolutely amazing".
But I DO NOT WANT to reward someone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their intellect) who I believe represents and broadcasts an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
Just like us", she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name to follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, formerly known as Snoop Lion and of course the late music legend Prince, changed his name to the symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was killed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is due to appear in court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges are being reviewed by the State Attorney's Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has embarked on a toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow, a sword-wielding character in the HBO medieval fantasy series.
The actor, 31, however, broke with the stereotype of the macho hero and said that such roles on screen mean that young boys often feel they have to be tough to earn respect.
He told The Sunday Times Culture Kit that he believes something is wrong and asked how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Star of the Throne star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted he's "pretty vocal" about the issue.
"At this point, I personally feel, quite strongly, what's wrong with masculinity?" he said.
What are we teaching the adolescent male about the problem we're seeing here?
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity through its very masculine characters.
He continued: "What is innate and what is learned?
What do they teach boys on TV, on the streets, that they need to have a side of every man?
I think that's really one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change that?
Because young man, something has definitely changed for the worse.
He also admitted in an interview that he will not be playing in any prequels or sequels of Game of Thrones after the series is over, because he has had enough of the fighting and the horses.
Starting in November, Kit will star in the newly remade True West by Sam Shepard, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a bandit.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his current wife, Rose, was the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife while I was making the show, "so he gave me my future family and my whole life after that", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the object of love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in this Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the grounds of Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
In the country, according to official figures, more than 820,000 people are affected by the virus.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, which was a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread through parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people year-on-year.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly still widespread.
Given the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many of the diseases are transmitted through inadequate sexual protection during these contacts.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV treatment as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staffers leaked GOP senators' data, eschewing the terms "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theory".
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff sent the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators to lawmakers' wikis.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed the allegations were backed by right-wing scientists and websites.
"Lies, lies and more despicable lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information surfaced online on Thursday and was posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on sexual abuse allegations by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address that sources the posts is associated with Waters' office and have released information about Waters' staff members, Hill says.
"This unsubstantiated claim is completely untrue and an absolute lie", Waters continued.
A member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations - was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is completely untrue and an absolute lie.
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry", wrote Fleischer.
It suggests he doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When a man is accused of something he didn't do, he can't get angry.
He must not be defiant.
They can't question the prosecutor's motives.
They must be calm and not get upset.
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was criticized for appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who ran against Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"If it were true, it would be something", he tweeted.
In her statement, Ms Waters said that her office had brought these fraudulent claims to the attention of the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed", she continued, "and that they are held legally responsible for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to each and every member of my staff".
Johnny English again interferes with the reviews of the weaker spy parody Rowan Atkinson
It's become commonplace to look for Brexit in every new British-themed film, as seems to be the case with this re-animation of Johnny English in a series of action parodies - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was brought back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this brazen satire about how obviously bad of a nation we are be our new export opportunity?
In any case, this chubby, incompetent, gummy-face Johnny English had his license to repackage the stuff in a whole new way - the name more than anything else signaling that it's a broad comic creation for a non-English-speaking cinematic audience.
He's, of course, the dumb undercover agent who, despite his bizarre claims to smoothie glamour, has a little bit of Inspector Clouseau, a little bit of Mr. Bean, and a big chunk of the guy who sang the single note in the Chariots of Fire at the London 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony.
The character is also originally based on the traveller and international mystery man that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercials, and who left a trail of chaos behind.
There are one or two nice moments in this latest issue of "It".
I loved Johnny English, how he would approach the helicopter in medieval armour and the rotor blades would briefly tickle his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is on display, but the humor feels quite undersized and strangely redundant, especially as serious movie franchises like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now offer comedy as a definite component of their productions.
The humor is more like it's meant for children than adults, and to me, Johnny English's crazy trampolines are as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent film gags in Mr. Bean.
The consistent assumption is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber hacker infiltrated a British super-secret spy web and revealed the identities of all British agents in the field, much to the dismay of an agent in the service - too small a role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the final straw for the Prime Minister, who is a pompous and biased character who is already suffering from a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson plays this would-be Theresa May character to the best of her ability, but there's not much in the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that once every active spy is compromised, she'll have to bring someone back from retirement.
That means Johnny English himself, who is now employed as a director at some fancy establishment, but also gives a record-breaking lesson on how to be a secret agent: here's a couple of cute gags, because English offers a spy academy similar to the Rock School.
English returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and was reunited with his long-suffering former partner Bough, played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now a married man living with a submarine commander, an afflicted figure on whom Vicki Pepperdine's talent may be a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin, in their quest to pack up the secret services for Her Majesty, are back in action and meet the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's cybercrimes: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of outrageous pranks: disguised as waiters, they set a French restaurant on fire; they create chaos when they sneak aboard Volt's luxury yachts; and English unleashes pure anarchy when he tries to get to know the interior of Volt's house through virtual reality.
I'm sure all the ess are ready for this final sequence, but as self-indulgent and as wild as she is, she has a little kid's TV in her.
A fairly moderate matter.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but wonder: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that truly matches his talent?
Labour denies that they've developed a plan for the English to work four days a week to get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is set to consider a radical plan that will see the British work four days a week and get paid for five.
The party allegedly wants company bosses to pass on to workers the savings that come from using artificial intelligence (AI).
The employees would enjoy a three-day weekend - but they would still be paid the same.
Sources say the idea would fit into the party's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country in favor of workers.
The move to a four-day work week was approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A long-time Labour member told the Sunday Times: "The evaluation of this measure is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
It's not going to happen overnight, but a four-day work week is a wish that fits into the party's stance of balancing the economy in favour of the worker and the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party promised a four-day working week during their 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: 'The four-day work week is not our party's policy and the party does not consider it'.
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a labor conference last week to fulfill his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell has stated that he is committed to restoring the energy of "anonymous" CEOs and "experts" in utility companies.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies do not have to return their total share because the Labour government could make 'cuts' based on perceived wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and to create equity funds which give 10% of the equity of private businesses to employees who are entitled to an annual dividend of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy said on 60 Minutes that the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh may have changed their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination for at least a week, raising the question of whether the bureau's findings could sway any Republican senators into withdrawing their support.
In an interview with 60 Minutes on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
I mean, of course, said Kennedy.
I told you I went to the hearing, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it happened, when the allegation came out, and he said, "Did you do this?"
He was determined, determined, decisive.
But Graham 's decision is unshakable .
"I've already made my decision on Brett Kavanaugh and that would be a really explosive accusation", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know that Brett has vehemently denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And none of the people she named could verify that.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see that changing anything.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York City, the annual Global Citizen Festival music event will feature a very impressive lineup of stars and an equally impressive mission to end world poverty.
The seventh annual Global Citizen Festival welcomes tens of thousands of people to gather in Central Park to not only enjoy the likes of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's real goal, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international group that promotes ending poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to complete a series of tasks or actions, such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, calling, or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal to end poverty.
But how successful was Global Citizen now, 12 years before it reached its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concerts really a way to convince them to demand action, or is it just another case of what's called "clicktivism" - people who feel that by signing an online petition or by tweeting off, they're making a difference?
Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million actions by its supporters since 2011, trying to achieve various goals.
He says these events have helped world leaders announce commitments and measures of more than $37 billion to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group had reported 390 commitments and notifications arising from its activities, of which at least USD 10 billion had already been paid or funded.
The group estimates that the funds secured have already directly impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Key commitments include the Power of Nutrition project, a UK partnership of investors and developers committed to "helping children grow to their full potential", pledging $35 million to help Rwanda end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice in the form of malnutrition a footnote in history", the Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also reported that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on their website, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and hard road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the performers at this year's New York event, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use navy to blockade Russian energy exports - Home Minister
Washington may "recourse to the Navy if necessary" to prevent Russian energy from invading markets including the Middle East, revealed US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where it is acting at the invitation of a legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to bring energy to the East, to the southern belly of Europe", he allegedly said.
And according to the official statement, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability to use our Navy to make sure that the waterways are open and if necessary blocked, to make sure that their energy is not going to the market", he said.
Zinke addressed the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that is considered the "voice of energy consumers" in the US.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are practically the same.
The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to invest in or replace fuels,he said, while referring to Russia as a 'single-purpose player' with a fossil-fuel-dependent economy.
The announcement comes as the Trump administration is on a mission to boost its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and has replaced Russian, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to back off on the "unsuitable" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has made Berlin a "capital of Moscow".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's vehement opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US has taken a stand from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's largest industrial organization, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), has called on the US to avoid EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren promises to take a close look at her 2020 presidential bid, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that after the midterm elections, she's taking a closer look at the presidential race.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering a candidate.
"It's time for women to come to Washington and fix our broken government, including the top female position", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I'll be taking a closer look at the presidential candidacy.
Warren also mentioned Donald Trump during the meeting and said he was taking this country in the wrong direction.
"I fight to the bone what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his appointment of Chief Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted that "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
But a poll released Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's constituents don't think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "likely" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent would support the nomination.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent for the candidacy and 48 percent against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names in the mix for potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'll make a formal decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD by Track Palin at a meeting with Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being listed in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, what he's going through after his return, "could be relevant to other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and some of the injuries that our troops are coming back with", she told the audience at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans, "They come back a little different, they come back stronger, they come back and ask if there is any respect for the things that their fellow soldiers and airmen, and every other member of the military, give to their country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic assault on a woman, interfering with a domestic violence report, and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports call for new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to the U.S. government's new measures denying asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia issued a brief statement Friday in Washington, D.C., to support asylum seekers and to challenge the measure, NBC reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case, filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy, has not been disclosed.
She said her partner and his sons and members of a violent gang abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum request on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
State attorneys supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce large numbers of asylum seekers in the U.S., as nations facing pervasive gang and domestic violence problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 immigration appeals court decision that allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new measure "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
Federal law requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a barrier violates this principle, a brief friend said.
The lawyers further argued briefly that a policy that denies entry to immigrants harms the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "add the necessary work".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic and gang violence as early as June.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or because of political opinion", Sessions said in his June 11 statement.
Asylum was never intended to alleviate all the problems - even the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Pala, where the death toll has doubled, are racing to find survivors.
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse and worse.
"It's very tense", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who was comforting her feverish son at an evacuation center in the arid city of Palu.
Every minute, the ambulance brings another body.
Clean water is rare.
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes, crawling through the trash and trying to save whatever they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals that were destroyed by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake were paralyzed.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken spine and shoulder, were laid to rest at Palu Army Hospital, where patients were being treated outside for ongoing severe aftershocks.
He was in tears as he described the feeling that a violent earthquake had shaken the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
It wasn't time to save yourself.
"I think I was dragged into the wall collapse", Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
I heard my wife calling for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're okay.
The US ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with propaganda ads
A week after the official Chinese daily published a four-page ad in an American newspaper that touted the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday mentioned the China Daily surcharge in the Des Moines Register - the state's largest selling newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of trying to meddle in the U.S. congressional elections on November 6.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in the US election marked what US officials said was a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it's common for foreign governments to run trade-promotion ads, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war that is manifesting itself in the level of each other's imports.
China's retaliatory sanctions at the start of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime Iowa governor, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a commentary in the Des Moines Register on Sunday that China is now doubling down on this bullying by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press.
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's precious tradition of free speech and a free press by placing paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at a newsstand on a Beijing street, you will find limited dissenting voices and see no real reflection of the disparate views that Chinese people might have on China's troubling economic trajectory, given that the media is owned by the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that one of China's major newspapers had declined an offer to publish his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans are leaving their constituencies ahead of the election over a Kavanaugh debacle, analysts warn
As many top Republicans defend Chief Justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who faces multiple sexual assault charges, the analyst warned they'll see a response, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions around this case have been extremely high, and most Republicans on record are already saying they want to proceed with the vote.
These things can't be taken back", said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute push for an FBI investigation will be enough to calm voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow, not even in November", Karine Jean-Pierre, chief counsel and spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, told the D.C. newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" at a demonstration in the Senate corridor, where Republicans, who are in charge of the Judiciary Committee, decided to appoint Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will break records", said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst.
♪ People say it's been high, it's true ♪
But it could be higher, especially among suburban, hesitant female voters and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who may not like the president but don't often go to the polls.
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that if Republicans confirmed, she might be opposed.
"There's been a mess of confusion for the GOP", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh gets to the chair, it's also about how the Republicans did it and how they handled it", said Guy Cecil, director of U.S. Priorities, a group that helps elect Democrats, pointing to the news outlet.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided in their opinions on who to believe in light of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with somewhat more sympathy for the latter.
A new poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or likely believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or likely believe Kavanaugh's.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Under pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals at a party while he was a student at Yale in the '80s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to start a new Internet and overtake Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the tech legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source platform called Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal of Project Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now", he said about this startup.
It's a historic moment.
The application uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own personal online data store or POD.
It may contain contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in one browser and all at once.
What's unique about personal online data storage is that it's entirely up to the user to decide who will have access to what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
The purpose of the Inrupt project, according to John Bruce, the company's CEO, is to bring resources, processes and the appropriate skills to help the Solid platform be available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform that IBM bought, some of the employees who work on the project, collaborated on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can build their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team with Facebook and Google are not talking about bringing in a complete change where all their business models are turned upside down overnight.
We don't ask for their permission.
In a media post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the mission of the Inrupt project is to provide a commercial energy and ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new website built on the Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web", added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the clergyman who received the Victoria Cross during World War I
Celebrations marked the 100th anniversary of the only Anglican clergyman to receive a Victoria Cross as a combatant in World War I.
The Reverend Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded the medal on 29 September 1918 for his actions at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later, he was killed by a sniper, and he never learned that he had received Britain's highest military honor.
His two grandsons unveiled a memorial stone to him Saturday at a ceremonial procession in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his great-grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's triumphal feat.
According to the London Gazette of 29 September 1918, Lt Col Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin in very dense fog and heavy fire from field guns and machine guns.
Later, he got to the front line and with the utmost courage led the line forward before he single-handedly plunged into the firing range and knocked out three detached units.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Michael Vann said his grandfather's actions were something I could never do, but also something humiliating.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, laid a wreath after a show led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honoured to be able to take part in the parade, adding that the courage of a true hero is shown by the support given by many people.
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead they got Peppa pig.
Imagine waiting all night to watch the smashed Bellator 206 only to be denied the main event.
The San Jose ticket contained 13 points, including six on the main card, and was broadcast live in the UK all night on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared for their match, viewers in the UK were left in stunned silence when the news turned to Peppa Pig.
Some were left unmoved after staying up until the early hours of the morning for a game.
One Twitter fan described the change in the programming to a children's show as a form of bad joke.
"Under government regulation, at 6 a.m., such content is not appropriate and therefore it is necessary to broadcast children's programmes", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president for marketing and communications, after being asked about the broadcast.
Peppa Pig, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Bellator president Scott Coker said they'll be working on the show to include viewers in the UK in the future.
"I think if I think about broadcasting, we can probably do it", Cooker said.
But it's 6:00 a.m. on a Sunday, and we can't make it to Sunday, our time, Monday, their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, there were a lot of texts going back and forth and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But he wasn't, the government did.
I promise you it won't happen again.
We're going to reduce it to five games instead of six like we normally do and we've been trying our best to keep our promise to the fans and we've failed.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Tom Daley felt "less than" because of his sexuality.
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but it motivated him to pursue success.
The 24-year-old athlete said that it wasn't until he was in high school that he realized that "everyone is like him".
On the first Radio 4 Desert Island Disc, which featured Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out loud about gay rights to give others a "chill".
He also said that the prospect of becoming a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
Regular long-running host Kirsty Young has been on sick leave for several months.
Daley, who appeared as a castaway in Laverne's first program, stated that he felt "less valuable" than anyone else who grew up with him because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls".
He said, "Until now, these feelings of inferiority and otherness have been the very things that have given me the strength and the power to succeed".
He wanted to prove that he was somebody, so he wouldn't disappoint anyone who might find out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high profile LGBT rights campaigner, and used his presence at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he got in touch because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give others hope.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with the man of American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "reached him unprepared".
Daley took the Oscar winner, who's 20 years older, last year, but he said the age gap was never an issue.
"When you're so experienced at such a young age", he said at his first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died three years later of cancer, "it wasn't easy to find someone of his age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple adopted Robert Ray Black-Daley's son in June, and Daley said that his whole perspective changed.
"If you asked me last year, it would have been all about winning the gold medal", he said.
You know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic medal is Robbie.
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father was not resigned to the fact that he was going to die, and the last thing he asked was if they had tickets for the London Olympics in 2012 because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him you wouldn't be in the front row, Dad", he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was only when he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized he wasn't invincible", he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew I had dreamed of this all my life" "Jumping in front of our home crowd at the Olympics, I don't know a better feeling", he said.
It also inspired the choice of his first song, "Proud" by Heather Small, which resonated with him at the opening of the Olympics and still gave him goose bumps.

Mickelson, who was out of shape, was benched Saturday in the Ryder Cup.
American Phil Mickelson would have set a record by playing in his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he would have had to tweak his form to avoid it being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played in the event held every two years for a record twelfth time, was sent to the Saturday fourball and foursome by captain Jim Furyk.
Instead of being the center of the action, as was often the case in the U.S., the five-time major winner spent his day alternating between cheering and working on a game in a row that he hoped would fix what was bothering him.
The 48-year-old has never been the most straightforward of drivers, even at the peak of his career, so he's not an ideal choice for Le Golf National's narrow course, where the long, jagged terrain routinely punishes stray shots.
And if the golf course itself isn't disturbing enough, Mickelson faces British Open champion Francesco Molinari in Sunday's ninth match, who has won all four of his matches this week in a team with rookie Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who were down by four points, had launched 12 separate swords, escaped a quick advance, Mickelson's sword could have proved absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his husband and gave nothing else.
"He totally understands the role he had today, he patted me on the back, put his hand around my shoulders and said he'd be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
He's so sure of himself.
He's a member of the Hall of Fame, and he's been so helpful to these teams in the past and this week.
I guess I just couldn't see him playing two swords.
I had more in mind, but that's how it developed and we thought we had to go that way.
He wants to participate, just like everyone else.
Mickelson is going to beat Nick Fold's record for most Ryder Cup Wests played on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup career that never quite reached the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has a record of 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk says his presence has brought some intangible results.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, likes to make fun of people and is a great team-room companion", he explained.
I think the younger players also had fun going to him this week, which was fun to watch.
It's more than just a game.
Captain Thomas Bjorn of the European Commander knows that the great leadership may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that the big lead heading into the singles of the last days of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
Dane made his debut in a 1997 match at Valderrama, where the team led by captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but came within a tight 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You have to keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderrama, as well as in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but only by a narrow margin", said Bjorn, pictured, after watching the 2018 class win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to give Le Golf National a 10-6 lead.
So history and every member of this team has shown me that it's not over.
You'll be bored out of your minds tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
It's not over until all the points are on the board.
We have a goal and we're trying to get that trophy and that's what we're focusing on.
I said I'd focus on the 12 players on our side, but we also know what to expect from the other side - the best players in the world.
Bjorn, delighted by the way his players had performed on the challenging golf course, added: "I could never have done it on my own.
Tomorrow we have another animal to look forward to.
Tomorrow is the individual performance, and it's very difficult.
It's great to be out with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out there by yourself, your golfing capacity is fully tested.
That's the message you have to give to the players, to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your partner behind, and he has to go and get the best of himself.
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will make sure his players play better as individuals than as partners, with the exceptions of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four.
Furyk was personally on both sides of these big upsets, from being part of the winning team in Brooklyn to ending up on the losing side when Europe achieved the 'Miracle in Medina'.
I remember every goddamn word he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, encouraged his players to aim for the final day.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you want to start fast, like in Brooklyn, like in Medina.
When this pace goes one way, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle strokes.
So we set the lineup accordingly and made sure the boys felt like, you know, like we were going to do magic tomorrow.
Thomas was tasked with leading the counter-attack and facing Rory McIlroy in the final match with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
I went with that group of guys in that order, because I think it covers the whole journey, Bjorn said about his choice of singles.
German new warship delayed again
Germany's newest naval frigate was commissioned in 2014 to replace aging Cold War-era warships, but will be unavailable for at least another year due to faulty systems and a snowy coastline, local media reports.
The commissioning of the flagship Rheinland-Pfalz, a brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the military spokesman quoted by Die Zeit.
The ship was scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but difficult post-delivery issues have derailed the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels, ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is clear that they will be equipped with a high-powered cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship ballistic missiles, and certain stealth technologies such as reduced radar and infrared and acoustic elements.
Other important features include long maintenance periods  it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years out of home port.
But the continuous delays mean that the high-end naval vessels  that were supposed to enable Germany to send forces overseas  will be obsolete by the time they are commissioned, notes the daily Die Zeit.
The infamous F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had ever returned a ship to a manufacturer after a handover.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited a number of major "software bugs" and defects in the metal elements that would render the warship unusable in combat.
The software glitches were especially significant because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessel will be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors  which is half the manpower needed on the Bremen-class frigates.
It has also been shown that the ship is significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future innovation.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton vessel Rheinland-Pfal will be twice as heavy as the ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from the metallic component, the cost of the whole project, including crew training, is also a problem.
The original price of 2.2 billion euros is said to have risen to a staggering 3.1 billion euros.
The problems with the new frigates have become more significant in light of recent warnings that German naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, confirmed that the navy was indeed "running out of deployable ships".
The representative stated that the problems had been compounded by the fact that old ships were being decommissioned but no replacements were provided.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were capable of becoming part of the Navy's equipment.
The National Trust is listening to the secret lives of bats
A new study is being carried out at a bat colony in the Scottish Highlands to uncover how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
It is hoped that the findings of the research will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities for the species.
The study, carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow whistling and small-bodied bats and brown long-tailed and water bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key areas of this bat colony to monitor bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the bats' calls and what each species is doing.
A habitat map and report will be issued to create a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser for the NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as grassland creation, and the best practice for maintaining wooded areas for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and across the UK has been declining dramatically over the last century.
They are threatened by development and land development that affect the colonies and natural environment.
Wind turbines and lighting may also pose a risk, as can fly traps and chemical treatments of building materials and cat attacks.
Bats aren't actually blind.
But because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to track bugs and obstacles in flight.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has trained specialists who regularly conduct surveys, inspections of colonies, and sometimes rescue work.
The organisation has even established the first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The manager of the settlement, David Thompson, says that this is the ideal territory for them.
"We have a great area for bats here in Threave", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of ancient trees and the best habitat.
But there's still so much we don't know about bats, so the work we're doing here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to survive.
It highlights the importance of bat control before starting maintenance work in buildings, as it is possible that the unintentional destruction of one mother nest can kill up to 400 females and their young, which can destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, is encouraging the public to lend a hand in helping.
She said, "There's a lot to learn about our bats and a lot of species that we don't know about, how their populations are doing.
Ronaldo denies the rape charges and his lawyers are going to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations "fake news" and said that people wanted to make themselves visible by using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which has reported on these allegations.
This Portuguese Juventus forward has been accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly subsequently paid her $375,000 to keep her quiet about the case, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Within hours of the news of the allegations being made public, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke in an Instagram live video to his 142 million followers, labelling the information as "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to do that.
What they said today is fake news, "said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner to the camera.
They want to feed on my name.
It's only natural.
They want to be famous when they say my name, but that's part of their job.
I'm happy and I'm cool", said the player with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel on unsubstantiated charges, which they have called "unacceptable reporting of suspicion in private".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will be seeking compensation for "moral damage commensurate with the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent times".
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the gaming room where he allegedly raped her anal, according to court documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo knelt down after the alleged incident and told her that he was 99 percent right and 1 percent wrong.
The documents say Ronaldo confirmed he paid for the sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photos of her injuries taken at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she feared retaliation and feared public humiliation.
The 34-year-old says she is now seeking a re-trial because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the assault allegations, and this summer he was bought for €100 million by the famous Italian club Juve.
Brexit: Britain will forever regret the loss of its car manufacturers
Britain will forever regret losing its status as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said the company's secretary, Greg Clark.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its Burnaston plant, near Derby.
"A deal is necessary", Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of delays at borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnston plant, which makes the Auris and Avensis cars for the Toyota brand, produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other EU countries.
"My view is that if Britain suddenly left the EU at the end of March, we would see a production stop at our factory", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's chief executive in Burnsdon.
Other carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover in the UK, are spreading fear of leaving the EU without a deal on how cross-border trade works.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford just a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what manufacturers describe as risks to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is operated on a 'get-to-the-time' basis, with parts from UK and EU suppliers being delivered for custom-built cars within 37 minutes.
If the UK left the EU on 29 March without a deal, there could be a disruption at the border, which the industry says could lead to delays and a shortage of spare parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to have parts in stock for more than one day at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and production would therefore be halted.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's plans for a revival of future relations with the EU are 'precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks'.
"We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that allows, as I say, not only the current success, but also the seizure of this opportunity", he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The evidence, not just from Toyota, but from other manufacturers, is that we have to be absolutely capable of continuing what is a highly successful set of supply chains.
Toyota was not able to say how long the production would be stopped, but warns that in the long term the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately also at the expense of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at the Burnaston plant for 24 years and is the union president at the plant, said that union members are increasingly concerned: "I have experience that once these places disappear, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: 'We have put in place a precise and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU.'
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, the White House says
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with acting attorney general Rod Rosenstein may be postponed for another week as the Supreme Court battle with Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating interference in the Russian election, ties between Trump associates and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump fires the acting acting attorney general and threatens Mueller's independence, Washington's gossip has been feeding on it for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a camera to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of impeaching the president via the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein has denied the report.
But last Monday, he arrived at the White House surrounded by reports that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations headquarters in New York at the time, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, were testifying.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, delaying the full Senate vote yet again.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "The date hasn't been set yet, but it could be this week, maybe it'll have to be pushed back another week, given everything else that's going on at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I'll always keep the media up to date.
Some reporters disagree with this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference with the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders stated that too few press conferences were not caused by the aversion to the stage of television reporters, though she said: "I disagree with the fact that she's performing".
She subsequently suggested that the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president is holding more Q&A sessions than any president before him", she added, without citing evidence. "We were looking at the numbers".
The conferences will continue, Sanders said, but if press representatives had the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, it would undoubtedly be better than talking to me.
We're trying to do that, and you've seen that we've been doing that for the last couple of weeks, and there's going to be a press conference where you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump regularly takes questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Separate press conferences are a rarity.
This week in New York, the president is likely to show why with his laid-back and sometimes bizarre look before the assembled reporters.
Health Secretary writes to EU staff at NHS Scotland not to worry about Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health has written to EU staff working in the Scottish NHS to express her gratitude and wishes for them to stay on after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent the letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of claiming settlement status for EU citizens working in devolved public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "The UK and EU negotiations on withdrawal have continued throughout the summer, and are heading towards the decisions expected this autumn.
However, the UK Government is also taking steps to prepare for a possible scenario of a no-deal exit.
I know this must be a very unsettling time for all of you.
So I would like to reassure you of how much I value the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and our heartfelt wish is that you stay here.
Christion Abercrombie is proceeding with emergency surgery after a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers defensive end Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the rival Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed", Reed said.
The trainers and medics gave Abercrombie oxygen on the lateral line, then put him on a stretcher and prepared him for further evaluation.
A Tennessee state official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had undergone the surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that no details on the nature/ extent of the injury are available at this time and that Tennessee is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, the redshirt sophomore, is entering his first season for Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
Before Saturday's game, he had five total tackles, making it a total of 18 tackles for the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher property tax when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher property tax when they buy property in the UK, with the money being used to help the homeless under the new Tory plans
This act will neutralize the success of Corbyn's move to attract young voters
Increased property tax liability for non-UK taxable persons
It is expected to increase the Treasury by £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will pay higher property tax when they buy property in the UK, with the extra money used to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
This action will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high-income earners.
The property tax increase will affect individuals and businesses who don't pay taxes in the UK, with the extra money boosting the government's efforts to fight homelessness.
The surcharge, which is an addition to the current obligation to pay property purchase tax, including the higher rates introduced two years ago for second homes and purchases for rental purposes, can be as high as 3%.
It is estimated that the Treasury will increase its resources by up to £120 million a year.
Estimates say that 13 percent of London's newly built property is bought by non-UK residents, driving up prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to make it to the top of the home market.
Many of the country's rich areas - especially the capital - have become ghost towns because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a property tax cut to help more young people own their first home.
He accused the big building firms of keeping property prices high by taking up land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to withdraw quotas from affordable housing to fix Britain's "housing shortage".
Mr Corbyn announced a compelling set of proposed housing reforms, including rent control and an end to forced evictions.
He also wants to give the committees more power to build new homes.
Mrs May said: 'Last year I said I wanted to dedicate my efforts as Prime Minister to rebuilding the British dream, so that each new generation can have a better life.
And that means fixing our broken property market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and make a life here.
But it can't be right that it should be easy for non-British residents and foreign companies to buy houses in the same way as hardworking British residents.
For many people, the dream of home is too far away, and the shame of sleeping without a roof over your head is too real.
Jack Ross: "My highest ambition is to rule Scotland".
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "highest ambition" is to become Scotland manager at some stage.
The 42-year-old Scot is looking forward to the challenge of rebuilding a club in the North East, which currently sits in third place in the Premier League, just three places below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to play for my country like a player.
I got a B grade and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But I grew up watching Scotch in Hampden with my dad when I was a kid, and that's always something that draws me back.
But that opportunity would only come if I was successful in running the club.
Ross's predecessors in the role of Sunderland manager have included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he felt no anxiety about the succession of such established names at such a big club, having previously turned down foreplay from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
Success for me at that time would have been measured by whether I could get this club back into the Premier League.
"The structure and equipment of this club is unquestionably Premier League", he said.
It's not an easy task to get him back, but I think I'd be successful if I could get the club back.
Ross has only been in management for three years, having previously worked as assistant manager at Dumarton and spent 15 months as a Hearts trainer.
He then helped Alloa to recover from relegation to the third division and transformed St Mirren from an incipient relegation to the championship winner the following season.
And Ross says he feels much better now than he ever did in his career playing for clubs Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
It was probably a real crossroads, like the one that Alloa took.
I really believed that leadership was more important to me than acting.
It sounds strange, because I was good, made a good living, and enjoyed a reasonable altitude.
But acting can be challenging.
There's a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of the stress and pressure of the job, but I just feel good about the leadership.
I always wanted to be a manager, and now that I am, I feel like I'm in my own skin more than I've ever felt in my entire adult life.

Research has found that the perfect time to get drunk is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat wave has boosted the revenues of struggling British pubs, but has also increased pressure on the chain's restaurants.
The numbers show that pub and bar groups recorded a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the consulting firm CGA, which produced the final reports, said: "Sustained sunshine and longer than expected England's World Cup participation meant that July followed a similar pattern to the previous June, with pub attendance increasing by 2.8 per cent, but restaurants were even more affected.
The 1.8 percent decline in restaurant sales in June worsened in July.
The pubs and bars that sell drinks have been the strongest performers so far, and the restaurants have been the worst.
Food-based businesses have also suffered, although not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
It seems like people just wanted to go out for drinks.
Between the controlled values and bars, beverage sales rose 6.6 percent for the month, while food sales fell 3 percent.
Paul Newman, from the leisure and hospitality analyst firm, said: 'These results are a continuation of a trend that has been ongoing since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of major social or sporting events are the biggest factors when it comes to sales outside the domestic market.
Not surprisingly, the restaurant chains continue to struggle, though the 4.8 percent annual sales decline will be especially painful in light of ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer couldn't be a worse time for food-lure businesses, and time will tell if the milder temperatures we've experienced in August will bring much-needed relief.
The overall growth in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the presentation of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales monitor for the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of over £9 billion, an established industry benchmark.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents
One in five children  as young as 11  has a secret social media account that he hides from parents and educators, research shows
A survey of 20,000 high school students has shown a rise in fake Instagram accounts.
Reports have raised concerns that sexual content is being published
Twenty percent of the students said that they had a parent-account account that their parents knew about
One in five children  aged just 11  create social network accounts that they hide from their parents.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has revealed a rapid increase in "fake Instagram accounts" sharing photos.
Reports indicate concern that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of the students said they have a fancy primary account that their parents know about, and they also have a private account.
A mother who stumbled upon her 13-year-old daughter's secret Web site found that her teenager was encouraging others to rape her.
Research by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent Schools Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) found that 40 per cent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, with half admitting to having private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers can't find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of athletes in the Scottish Athletics Committee.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics board as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the management committee.
Doyle is the most decorated lightweight athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those in sports leadership like you, who will benefit from her vast experience at the international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh has a great deal of respect in the Scottish, British and world athletic community and we are sure that she will be a great asset to the athletics community in Scotland as a member of the committee", said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I'm excited to be the voice of the athletes and I hope to be really useful and help lead the sport in Scotland".
The American, who won the 200- and 400-meter races at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, won four gold medals in total, and is now a regular expert on the BBC, could not walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "I had a seizure a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover or to what extent.
It is exhausting, but I have made a full recovery, learned to walk again, and today I am able to do the exercises!
Thank you for all the encouraging news!
A milk-sucking machine that makes mothers look like cows is dividing opinion online
A company that makes vacuum cleaners has caused controversy online by advertising that compares nursing mothers to milking cows.
As part of the launch of the 'world's first silent portable vacuum cleaner', consumer technology company Envi has released a music video with a hype to show the freedom the new vacuum cleaner gives to breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dancing in a hay barn with cows to a song that says, "Yes, I'm getting pregnant, but you can't see any tail", and "In case you haven't noticed, I have no tail, here are my breasts".
The chorus continues: "Pump, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, I water my sweethearts with milk".
The ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked a controversial response online.
The video has had 77,000 views and hundreds of comments and has received mixed reactions from those who saw it, with many stating that it sheds light on the horrors of the dairy industry.
A very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must be pregnant and give birth to give milk, but their babies are taken away a few days after birth", one commentary says.
The Elvie suction cup is discreetly applied to the breast (Elvie/mother)
Other comment: "Understandably traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their children?
Someone else added: "The ad is totally off. "
There were also those who defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she considered the song "delicate".
I think it's a great idea.
I'd get that pump if I was still sucking.
I feel like a cow when I suck.
The commercial is a little crazy, but it's good.
It's a brilliant product, wrote one user.
Another added: "It's a fun ad targeted at mothers who are sucking their milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like 'queens'".
It's not an ad to praise or condemn the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women show up, all dancing with discreet drawers hidden under their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the observation that many women who suck milk report feeling like cows.
But Elvia's suction is silent, with no wires or tubing, and it fits nicely into a breast-feeding bra, giving women freedom of movement, the ability to hold a baby and even walk while sucking.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD for mothers, added a comment: Elvie's feeding tube is a revolutionary product that deserves a strong and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between lactating mothers and lactating cows, we wanted to highlight the suction of milk and all the challenges that come with it, and show the fun and reliable, incredible sense of freedom that the new suction machine provides.
It's not the first time Elvie's strawberry has been exposed.
During London Fashion Week, one of the two mothers, designer Marta Jakubowski, who was using the product, appeared on the catwalk.
Hundreds of migrant children have quietly moved into a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of migrant children detained has risen sharply despite the fact that monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, mainly because the harsh rhetoric and policies put in place by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children with escorts.
Most of the escorts were traditionally undocumented immigrants who were afraid of jeopardizing their ability to stay in the country, so they claimed to be the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their household must provide fingerprints and that this data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency has arrested hundreds of people who applied for unaccompanied minor status.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
Up to 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or sponsors' household members are in our country illegally, and a large number of them are criminals.
So we're going to continue to pursue them", Mr. Albence said.
According to asylum officials, in an effort to speed up processing of children's cases, officials have introduced new rules that will require some to appear in court within a month of their detention, instead of the previous standard 60 days.
Many will appear via videoconference call instead of in person to declare their case as legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed not to be eligible for aid will be deported quickly.
The longer a child is in foster care, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to tantrums or escape attempts, say the shelter's staff, citing system reports over the past few months.
Advocates say that these concerns are heightened in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where signs of child abuse are more likely to go unnoticed because of the size of the facility.
They added that moving the children to a tent camp without enough time for emotional preparation or to say goodbye to friends could trigger a trauma that many children are already dealing with.
Syria has announced that the US, French and Turkish occupation forces are to withdraw immediately.
During a speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for the return of Syrian refugees home, even though the country is in the eighth year of war.
Moualem, who is also acting Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are on Syrian territory illegally under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that we will be dealt with accordingly.
"He must surrender immediately and unconditionally", he told the assembly.
Muala insisted that "the war on terror in Syria is almost over", with more than 360,000 people killed and millions more displaced since 2011.
He said that Damascus will continue to fight this holy battle until we have rid all Syrian territories of terrorist groups and any foreigners present illegally.
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
In handing over the refugees, Moualem said that conditions were good for them to return and accused some Western countries of promoting irrational fears that caused the refugees not to return.
'We have approached international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns,' he said.
 They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue. 
The United States and the European Union have warned that no recovery assistance will be available to Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a safe zone in Idlib's last stronghold has created an opportunity to move the political discussions forward.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, which is home to three million people.
However, Moualem pointed out that the deal has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front fighters, "who will be eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to hold the first meeting of the new committee of government and opposition members soon to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out the terms of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "checking the articles of the existing constitution" and issued a warning against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
By this logic, Donald Trump would have won another election in 2020 if, as many liberal observers are hoping, the impeachment and scandal had not prematurely ended his presidency.
If so, it would undoubtedly be the most dramatic presidential term finale in history!
So far, there are no signs of fatigue in the observers.
Since 2014, prime-time viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average audience of 2.4 million in prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago according to Nielsen, and "The Rachel Maddow Show" on MSNBC has increased cable viewership to 3.5 million watching the nightly news.
"It's a spark that draws people in because it's something we don't understand", said Neal Baer, host of "Designated Survivor", an ABC drama about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack that destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, the veteran comedy writer and host of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has a different theory.
He recalls driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was voting for Trump.
Why? she asked.
He said, "Because he's fun", Mrs. Scovell told me.
It's the meaning of fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story taking place in Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite and benefit the global economy.
Tune is a luxury that only the most privileged of the spectators can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen to spend six hours watching a panel of experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of "deep backup" resources for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000-worth of leather jackets (the "dress of arrogance" as reported by the Washington Post) and the consequences of Stormy Daniel's disgusting portrayal of Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I'm not gonna look at Super Mario the same way again, by the way.
"Part of what it does and what makes it feel like a reality show is it feeds you something every night", said Brent Montgomery, a senior executive at Wheelhouse Entertainment and the author of the Pawn Stars documentary about the rotating c.N.F.L. Trump show, in which he praises Kim Jong-un).

When I connected with Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny outside on the north shore of Kauai, 80 degrees, but he was tucked inside watching MSNBC and taping CNN.
He couldn't pull away, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood up to the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows and people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was a joke, but they turned out to be right.

Money from abroad flows into the closest domestic plants medium-term choices
It's no surprise that the 17th District of Pennsylvania is experiencing a financial flurry from the reorganization of congressional districts that has generated two incumbents vying for the same seat.
That recently led to the re-creation of the Pittsburgh suburb by district Democrat-Republican Conor Lamb, who won another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is heavily overlapping with the new 17th.
After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been unconstitutionally divided in favor of the Republicans, the map was redrawn.
The race in the new 17th district has started a bitter financial feud between the major party's financial branches, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The Lamb name became well known in Pennsylvania after narrowly winning the closely watched March special election for the 18th Congressional District.
This seat has been held by a Republican for over a decade, and Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political pundits give the Democrats a slight head start.
America is considering a fine on El Salvador for supporting China, but then backs down.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing under mild pressure from Washington.
President Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and was staying at a hotel in Panama until the partners sued the Trump administration's organizing team.
State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. diplomatic chiefs from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in light of recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But the fines were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including funds for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed fines, which included cuts in financial aid and focused on visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rate.
With internal negotiations continuing, North and Central American leaders postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity following similar talks the previous year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading to the US.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made it clear that they wanted to continue negotiations and effectively end any sanctions that were under consideration for Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now in charge of resolving the conference currently scheduled for mid-October, as part of a signal the administration is putting to the negotiations, diplomats said.
And three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any fresh news from Washington.
White House spokesman Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which was described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal negotiations on the condition of anonymity.
Their sources were confirmed by an outside analyst who is close to the government executive and also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The history of the study
The final nail in the coffin could be Robert Mueller's report from the Special Committee on the possible obstruction of Mr. Trump's right to practice law, of which there is now ample evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller's investigation reportedly includes whether the Trump campaign had a secret deal with Russia to attack our election.
If there were a change of parties in Congress, Mr. Trump would have to face the body as he prepares to face the voters again, and eventually, he would likely face a jury of his peers.
That's a whole range of "ifs", and I don't want to say that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, as is the case with similar politicians in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice to make that will affect how long this suffering will continue.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, all that was needed was for the Western powers to stand up to him in Munich and support Czechoslovakia.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the long years of bloodshed that followed.
History revolves around such critical moments that speed up or slow down the relentless march of democracy.
Americans are now facing several similar critical moments.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who is running the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein had been in a state of shock since the report that he had secretly proposed to replace the president last year, and he speculated that he was not medically fit to hold the office of president.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times' version of events is inaccurate.
How do we respond if the newly requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or what if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite the compelling allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
And most importantly, will we be voting in the middle of the term for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will have a long, dark night ahead of it.
But I believe we can't, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew, deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, sent me to light candles on a swastika table on a Saturday.
How can I not be optimistic about our future with such a legacy?
Norman Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is the chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, D.C., and the author of The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House.
Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about a clash with Rapid Vienna.
Rangers on Thursday host Rapid Vienna, knowing that a win over the Austrians would give them a great chance of promotion from Group G of the Europa League after a spectacular draw in Spain at Villarreal earlier this month.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use the result as a springboard to bigger things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal have a good team", said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game thinking we could make a dent, and we took the point.
We may have been able to reproduce it in the end, but overall, it was probably a fair draw.
They were probably better in the first half, but we got better in the second half and we were better again.
Thursday is another big European night.
I hope we can get the three points, but it's going to be tough because they had a good result in the last game, but with the fans behind us, I'm sure we can push and do well.
Last year was pretty rough, with all the injuries and changes at the club, but now I feel really good about it.
The team is strong and the guys are really enjoying it, and the training is good.
I hope we can get back to that now, put the past season behind us, and be successful.
Women are worried about their retirement savings.
Although survey respondents had a clear idea of how they were to be cared for, few talked about it with family members.
About half of the people in the national study said they had discussed the cost of long-term care with their partner.
Only 10 percent said they had discussed the subject with their children.
"People want to be cared for by a family member, but they don't want to discuss it with them", explains Holly Snyder, vice president of the National Life Insurance Company.
You can start like this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for care without first telling them what you want.
Discuss where and how to receive care with your counselor and family, as these factors can play a large role in determining the cost.
Call your financial adviser: The adviser can help you find a way to cover these expenses.
Financing long-term care can be done, for example, with traditional long-term care insurance, a hybrid cash-on-the-money life insurance policy to help you pay for these expenses, or with self-insurance using your own funds as long as you have the money.
Create your own legal documents: Avoid legal battles while you can.
Designate a health care representative, who will be a trusted person who will oversee your medical care and ensure that doctors respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate on your own.
Also consider signing a power of attorney for your finances.
You choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and to pay your bills if you are not able to do so yourself.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your grandparent is in urgent need of medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about his medications and allergies?
Write these details on your written schedule so that you will be prepared.
"It's not just about the finances, but what are the names of the doctors who are in charge?" asks Martin.
Where are the meds?

The man in Ilfracombe was shot several times with a BB gun.
As the man was walking home after a night shift, he was hit by several rounds from an air rifle.
The victim, believed to be in her 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police described the shooting, which occurred at around 2:30 BST, as an accidental act.
The victim never saw the attacker.
The victim's injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and officials said the death toll was expected to rise.
With communications out of order, the relief teams were unable to get any information from Donggala Regency, an area north of Pala, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about the city of Palu and the Donggala Regency on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital city of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was just celebrating its 40th anniversary when an earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency stretching over 300 km (180 mi) along the coast of northwestern Sulawesi.
The Regency, an administrative region under the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
The main components of the economy of Central Sulawesi are fishing and farming, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also significant in the province, but is concentrated mainly in Morowali on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donggal have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, the Donggale Tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
The tsunami that hit the western Donggala in 1996 also claimed nine lives.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and regularly experiences earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, with more than half of those in Aceh province.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake hits the south of Indonesia's most populous island, Java, causing a tsunami that hits the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, causing a 10-meter (32 ft) -high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A light earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh Province, causing destruction and panic as people were reminded of the devastating effects of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, no tsunami formed, but more than 100 died from collapsing buildings.
2018: A powerful earthquake struck the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on a domestic violence charge.
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers, 29-year-old Palin of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, tampering with domestic violence reports and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, when his female acquaintance tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, Palin took her phone.
Palin has been sent to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on an unsecured $500 bond, KTUU reports.
According to the network's report, he appeared in court on Saturday, where he stated that he felt "definitely innocent" when asked to comment.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could be sentenced to up to a year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which is punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin's faced a criminal complaint.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The alleged assault on the police was reported by his mother, Sarah Palin, on the phone.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of reporting of domestic violence, and possession of a weapon under the influence of a narcotic in connection with the incident.
Apparently, he punched his girlfriend in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by war veterans groups in 2016 when she linked her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his son's service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: hundreds dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communication networks are down and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck directly on the southern part of the island of Sulawesi, which lies northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos have surfaced on social media showing the moment of the disaster.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for a suspect in the NYC terrorist attack .
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfulla Saipov, who is suspected of committing the terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people, an extraordinary sentence that has not been given for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly staged an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October using a rented Home Depot truck to run down pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to defend the death penalty, the prosecution will need to prove that Saipov intentionally killed eight victims and intentionally caused a number of injuries, which are the terms of a death sentence approved by the Southern District of New York.
According to court documents, both of those numbers would mean the death penalty could be imposed.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 felony charges, including murder-for-extortion charges, which federal prosecutors routinely use in organized crime cases, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "considerable planning and preparation", the plaintiffs claim, describing the manner in which Saipov's act was carried out as "heinous, cruel and depraved".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, pain and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferrucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damiano Pagnucco, is named in the indictment.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the Southern District of New York last handed down a death sentence.
Defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was actually carried out was in a 1953 federal case in New York City, when a married couple, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, were executed after being convicted of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were both put in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed minimal remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to the police, he said he felt good about what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by watching Islamic State videos on his phone.
Police also revealed that he also demanded the Islamic State flag be displayed in his hospital room.
He has pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutors' decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty in lieu of accepting a plea and life without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team has previously asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
The Conservative Party's MPs say he should be in charge of the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage, at today's protest at the Conservative Party conference, pledged to mobilize the people's army.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians must 'feel the pressure from the Eurosceptics' and, as one of Theresa May's own MPs had suggested, he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Tory MP Peter Bone said at a march in Birmingham that the UK would be out by now if Mr Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the problem Mrs May faces in reconciling her deeply divided ranks has been further highlighted by the EU-remain Conservatives who have joined a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep her Chequers compromise plan going under attack from Brexit supporters, the Remainers and the EU itself.
The coalition insists it will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels whatever the consequences  and force Eurosceptics and Labourists to choose between its package and 'chaos'.
Mr Bone said the Leave Means Leave group was meeting in Solihull, where he wanted to "screw Chequers".
He suggested to Mr Farage that he should become a representative and be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd be out by now", he said.
Wellingborough added: 'I'll stand for Brexit, but we have to back off on Chequers.'
To show his opposition to the EU, he said: 'We did not fight the world wars to be obedient.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr. Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that British citizens would change their minds and want to stay is completely out of the question".
Conservative Brexit campaigner Andrea Jenkyns, who also attended the rally, told reporters: 'I simply say, Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for him, and he is not liked by our party members or by our activists who are currently filling the streets to get us elected at all.
Forget about the Chequers and start listening.
In a blunt message to Mrs May, he says: 'Prime Ministers keep their jobs by keeping their promises.'
Mr Farage said that Conservative politicians must 'get themselves into an awkward situation' if they are to betray their decision taken on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
'Now it's about trust between us, the people and our political class,' he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit and we're standing here today to tell them that we won't let you do that.
In a message to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: 'I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel the pressure.
"We are now mobilizing the army of the people of this country who have secured for us victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we are an independent and proud Great Britain in self-government".
The pro-Remainers, meanwhile, marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Several activists held banners to the Anti-Brexit Conservatives after the party's launch weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis was mocking the Conservatives over security issues with the party's app after the conference kicked off.
"These are the people who, in their own words, can provide IT systems and technology for Canada plus plus, for a seamless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland", he added.
"It's all a farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, she added.
Warren plans to give her presidential candidacy a lot of thought.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will reconsider her bid for the presidency after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future Saturday at the town hall in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is seeking re-election in November against Republican Representative Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She found herself at the center of speculation that she could stand up to Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's rally in Holyoke was her 36th town hall meeting since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked her if she planned to run for the office of president.
Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that means a woman at the top.
Suspect in LSU shooting of Sims has been arrested.
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the Friday shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department has announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dython Simpson, at the 11:00 ET news conference.
A video of Friday's shooting has been released, asking for the identification of the man seen on the tape.
Sims, 20, was shot Friday morning near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims suffered a non-life-threatening gunshot wound to the head", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media through the 247sports website on Saturday.
Wayde was trying to protect his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to moving around the scene, having a gun, and admitting to shooting Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The 6-foot-6 Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games, including 10 last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is one step closer to the world title as the team's directors hand him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas finished ahead of Lewis Hamilton in Saturday's qualifying, it was clear that the Mercedes team direction would play a big role in the race.
From the pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost got rid of Hamilton, as he defended his position in the first two corners and challenged Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel took the lead and let Hamilton catch up to the cars circling in the tail of the group, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes driver was one lap late to the pit stop and after the start he was behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead and in a close battle the Ferrari rider had to reluctantly leave the inside track open to defend himself after a double manoeuvre at turn three.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the field and at the end of the first lap, on his 21st birthday, he was in the lead.
He then led for much of the race, holding the original tyres as long as possible to focus on a fast finish and take fourth position from Kimika Raikkonen.
He finally crashed on lap 44, but was unable to pick up the pace for the remaining eight laps and Raikkonen remained fourth.
It's a hard day because Valtteri has been doing a great job all weekend, and when he gets the order, he acts like a perfect gentleman.
"The team has done a fantastic job and the reward is the first two places", said Hamilton.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianne Feinstein at Saturday's rally for insisting on not releasing a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a speech at a rally in West Virginia, he did not directly mention the testimony given by Ford to the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead stating that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "loathsome and hateful and lying".
"One thing that could happen, and a wonderful thing that is happening in the last days in Senar, is when you see that anger, when you see those people, how angry and evil and nasty and lying they are", he said.
When you look at the release and the disclosure and they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do that.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, can you account for the escape?
Remember her answer... you published the document?
Oh, no, please.
She didn't.
Well, hold on a minute.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that was not the first time that I was there,
The Feinstein's sent Ford a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh in July and the information leaked early in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak was from her office.
"I did not conceal Dr. Ford's allegations, nor did I disclose any information about the case", said Ms. Feinstein, as reported by The Hill.
She asked me to keep it a secret, and I did exactly what she asked.
But her words were apparently not believed by the president, who said in a statement at the town hall on Saturday night: "I'll tell you, that's really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but either way, it's the worst body language I've ever seen.
The president continues to defend the Supreme Court nominee who was accused of sexual harassment by three women, and has indicated that Democrats are using these allegations to advance their own agenda.
They're determined to take back power by any means available.
You see the meanness, the abomination, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to push into the ground to get back to power and to the helm", Mediaite quoted the president as saying.
Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars have made up for Friday's Elite League defeat against the Belfast Giants with a win in Saturday's Dundee replay, which ended 5-3.
The Giants soon took a two-hole lead thanks to the interceptions of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were able to tie the game at home before Dwyer returned the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard then drew again for Dundee, with two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen securing their victory.
It was the third Premier League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's side, who beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday.
The two teams have met for the fourth time this season, with all three previous games dominated by Giants players.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute, in 3:35, from Kendall McFaul, while David Rutherford scored an assist on Beauvillier's second goal four minutes later.
The first third was wild as Sullivan got the home run back in the game at 13:10 and then Matt Marquardt set up a goal for Cownie to tie it at 15:16.
Thanks to Dwyer, the Giants went to the booth for the first half, albeit in the lead, when he scored his second goal of the night late in the first quarter.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again managed to equalize the goal from the overtime in a time of 27:37.
Cownie's and Charles Corcoran's combined effort later in the second-third helped Nielsen to give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match, and the same player secured his side's lead in the middle of the final third.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play their next game on Friday at home in Milton Keynes.
An air traffic controller died to allow hundreds of people on board the plane to escape the earthquake
The chief of air traffic control in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after he died while overseeing the safe takeoff of a plane with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people were killed and many are missing after a major earthquake and tsunami struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The strong aftershocks flooded the area, leaving many people trapped in the ruins of Palu.
But even as fellow 21 year old Anthonius Gunawan Agung ran for his life, he refused to leave his seat in the wildly shifting control tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed in his position to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought he was going down.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait told Australia's ABC News that the decision helped save hundreds of lives.
We arranged for a helicopter transport from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take him to a hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter could reach Palu.
"Our hearts are broken by this news", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities have expressed concern that the death toll could be in the thousands, and the disaster management agency said access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
"The death toll is rising as many bodies remain uncobbled under the wreckage and many are still unreached by rescuers", said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves in the devastated Pala reach up to six meters high and the city will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and civilian planes are bringing relief supplies to the affected areas.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute more bodies are brought here by ambulances.
There's a shortage of drinking water.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
It's a tragedy, but it could be worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I am asking you to work day and night and complete all tasks that are needed for evacuation".
Are you ready?
Indonesia was hit by the Lombok earthquake earlier this year, which killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now claims one person is missing after plane crashes in a lagoon
The airline operating the plane that crashed in a lagoon on one of the Pacific islands of Micronesia now reports one person missing, having initially reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that on Saturday afternoon, they were unable to locate a male passenger.
The airline said it is working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to locate the missing man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for details of this passenger, his age or nationality.
Local boats were assisting in the rescue of other passengers and crew after the plane went into the water while attempting to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
Officials said Friday that a total of seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in treatment on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
However, the cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon before it could hit the runway.
Some Witnesses thought the plane had crossed the line.
American passenger Bill Jaynes reported that the plane landed from a very low altitude.
"That was very good", Jaynes remarked.
Jaynes further stated that he and others managed to make it down a deep water channel to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the flight crew were panicking and screaming and that he himself had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working nearby on harbor dock repairs helped with the rescue by using an inflatable boat to carry passengers ashore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
The data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that a total of 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG registered aircraft over the past two decades, but no accidents have been reported to Air Niuguni.
Analyst describes the last moments of a woman who was burned alive
The prosecution on Saturday closed its case in this case, in which a man is being tried repeatedly for burning a woman alive in the state of Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice, represented by its analyst Paul Rowlett, has spent several hours testifying and providing expert testimony in the field of intelligence analysis.
The analyst outlined for the jury the scenario of using cell phone records of 29 defendant Quinton Tallis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers from the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several cell phones that proved Tellis was in Chambers' company on the night of her death, which contradicted his previous testimony, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When it was confirmed by cell phone data that he was with Chambers that night, he claimed to have been with his boyfriend, Michael Sanford, and was visited by police.
Sanford stood trial in the cathedral and testified that he was out of town on the day in question.
When the prosecution asked if Tellis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he was lying because my car was in Nashville that night.
Another discrepancy was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks on the day she died.
But cell phone records indicate the two had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her completely from his life", Hale said.
The defense will begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to go before a jury later that day.
What is conscious hip hop?
The hip hop trio wants to address the negative perceptions of the genre by infusing their music with positive messages.
The Bristol-based band High Breed claims that hip hop has moved on from its roots with political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and re-popularize conscious hip hop.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen a resurgence in the recent past with artists like Akala and Lowkey in the UK.
Another black woman?!
A New York schoolteacher is suing a couple for firing her after a racist text message.
A New York City nanny is suing a couple for their discriminatory dismissal after receiving a mistakenly sent text message from her mother that labeled her as "another black girl" in a text message.
The couple denied being racists and likened the lawsuit to "blackmail".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her shock when she discovered on her first day on the job in 2016 that her children's new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black.
"NOTHING BLACK", wrote Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Miss Maurice.
When she realized her faux pas, the "concerned" Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, saying that her outgoing African-American tutor had done a really bad job and that she was expecting a Filipina to take her place, the New York Post reported.
Mrs. Maurice received a paycheck for one job and was sent home by Uber.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for severance pay and $350 a day for the six-month engagement she was originally hired for, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them that this is not done", she told the Post this Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple, however, retaliated by saying that they were not racists but that terminating Ms. Maurice was an appropriate measure because they feared that after the insult they would no longer be able to trust her.
My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's definitely not a racist.
"We are not racists", her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
But would you entrust your child to someone you have mistakenly treated rudely?
Your newborn child?
Oh , come on .
Plasco likened the lawsuit to blackmail, stating that his wife was only caring for a two-month-old baby and was in a very difficult situation.
Would you hit someone like that?
That's not a nice thing to do", said the investment banker.
While the trial is still ongoing, the jury on social media quickly condemned the couple for their behavior and logic.
The publishers of the Paddington Bear stories were worried that readers might not identify with the talking bear, the latest news report shows.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, told the reporter: "It's hard to empathize with someone who's reading it for the first time, before it's even published.
It's very amusing to know that now that we know the great success of Paddington Bear.
She said her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write a children's book about a little teddy bear, was deeply disappointed that his work had been rejected, adding on the 60th anniversary of the book's publication that it had become a bitter point after his death last year.
She added that her father was very proud of Paddington's eventual success.
He was a quiet man, never a braggart, she said.
But because Paddington was such a real character to him, it was like you had a child who had achieved something that you could be really proud of.
I believe he viewed Paddington's success in this light.
Although it was his own creation and imagination, he always tried to attribute all his successes to Paddington.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone .
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louise Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Nad called me regularly to tell me that it was really bad and that he didn't expect to get away with it", Ms Ednan-Laperouse said.
Then I got a call from Nada telling me she was gonna die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
So I did.
I said, "Tash, I love you so much, sweetheart.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be there with you.
The medication that doctors had given her to keep her heart running was slowly losing its effectiveness and leaving her body.
She died shortly after that, and it was like everything was shut down.
I had to just sit there and wait, I knew what was going on.
I couldn't cry or scream because I was surrounded by my families and other people.
I just had to keep it in.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving over the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, without giving any indication of the ordeal she was going through.
"No one knew about it", she said.
"I kept my head down, tears streaming down my face the whole time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt an overwhelming understanding for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Grief-stricken women send postcards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide work together to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are sending out postcards from the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers for people to reach out for support.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler was only 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and as a result took his own life at 18.
"I wouldn't want any other parent to have to feel what I felt every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, said her son was a gifted young cook with an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said his smile could light up any room.
However, before he died, he left the job because it was a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his sibling's body after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis says: 'I am constantly concerned about the effect this will have on his life.'
Mrs. Davis designed postcards to let people know that there are people who are willing to help them and to talk to them, even if they are their friends.
Don't sit still. You have to speak.
Mrs. Humphreys, who is a longtime friend of Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"Nothing told me he was feeling down or depressed, nothing at all", he explains.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
The worst was on Christmas Eve when the kids opened their presents, and he didn't even look at them, nothing.
She said that the death of her partner was a huge trauma for them, but that they had to get over it gradually: "These things can make a hole in the family.
It tore us apart.
But we all have to go on and fight.

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation
"I thought we could get something that actually requested an investigation in a time-limited, limited scope, we could bring some unity to it", Mr. Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would "break up" because both sides would be buried in conquered positions after the partisan coup.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to open an investigation?
Their resistance is well timed.
The mid-term elections are just five weeks away, November 6th, and if the Republicans do as expected, it will lead to a major weakening of their efforts to put their man on the highest court in the land.
George W. Bush called senators, lobbied them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for President Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was then Bush's personal secretary.
What happens if the FBI compiles their report?
The Senate will vote on it, and currently there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
Still, it's unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would have allowed Vice President Mike Pence to break a tie and confirm in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees under Kim has decreased.
The number of North Korean refugees to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un's rule began seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea's Ministry of Unification, said there were 1,127 escapes  last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park also said that this was due to tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates demanded by smugglers at the border.
Pyongyang has made no public statements on this.
The vast majority of refugees from the North are now being offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border.
Most of them flee through China, which has North Korea's longest border and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which technically are still in a state of war, have improved markedly in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on stalled denuclearization talks.
This was followed by the historic meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, where they agreed on broad terms of cooperation on the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho accused the US of making no progress on sanctions.
"Without any trust in the US, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no way for us to unilaterally disarm", Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Democratic Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because of his temper.
Pelosi made the remark in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if any woman ever performed such a spectacle, they would call her 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said in her response to Kavanaugh's testimony Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh has emotionally denied all allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both still in their teens.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and choking on his own as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, saying their accusations against him were a "grotesque and coordinated attack" by organized liberals who had failed to move on after Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because he showed that he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with these statements and the way he leaned on the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi said no when asked if she would seek Kavanaugh's impeachment if he were confirmed, even if Democrats won a majority in the House.
"I'll tell you this: If he's not telling the truth to Congress, then he's not qualified to serve not only on the Supreme Court, but on the court he's serving on now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals .
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential proceeds in the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade court because he's considered a conservative judge.
In a hearing before his confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided answering the question of whether he would overturn any Supreme Court decisions.
"There is no time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to come into the courtroom and expect us to just say 'Oh, that's beautiful,'" Pelosi said.
And women have to be in charge.
After months and years of verbal outbursts and resentment, she couldn't get it out of her head without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, do you?
She continues: "I was helped a lot by a woman who was a director somewhere, and she told me that she also cries when she's angry, but she developed a certain technique, which is that when she's angry and she starts crying, she says to the person she's talking to, 'Maybe you think I'm crying because I'm sad.
But I am angry .
And so she continued.
And I think that's great.
Tears are acceptable as a response to anger, in part because they are misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories comes from my first job, working in an office dominated by men, where I once expressed my unspoken anger by crying, but the older, always cold manager, who I always feared a bit, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me up the stairs.
"Never show them you're crying", she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad they got you.
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential bid.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard the Monkey Business and had to withdraw from the fight, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found there was no reason why she couldn't explore the idea of running for president herself.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", she told me with a laugh after 30 years.
There were seven other candidates, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
But because the campaign was already running long at the time, she couldn't keep up with the fundraising, and she pledged not to fight unless she could raise $2 million in donations.
It was a losing battle.
She found that some of the supporters who would give $1,000 to a male candidate would only give her $250.
"Does he think I'll get a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced that she would not formally campaign, she was overwhelmed by her emotions, as an expression of gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it difficult for her to raise money and focus on voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism, that she was completely choking on anger.
"You might think I'm having a nervous breakdown", Ms. Schroeder said of the press reaction to her.
And you might have guessed that my main sponsor was the Kleenex Company.
I remember thinking, "What are they gonna write on my tombstone?"
Did she cry?
Why a Sino-American trade war might be good for Beijing
The opening salvo of the US-China trade war has been deafening, and while the battle is far from over, experts say the rift between the two countries could be a long-term win for Beijing.
Donald Trump, the US president, has issued the first warning this year by taxing Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
But most of the most significant escalations have come to light this week, with new tariffs announced on $200bn (£150bn) of goods, effectively taxing half of China's commercial exports to the US.
Beijing has responded each time, most recently by imposing tariffs on five to 10 percent of 60 billion dollars' worth of American imports.
China has been trying to pay the U.S. back with the same coin, and it's unlikely that the world's second largest economy would go down on its knees.
Even if China wanted Washington to go back to its old ways, it would mean giving in to its demands, but publicly submitting to American demands would be utterly humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts believe that if Beijing can play its cards right, a trade war with the US could be a positive long-term boost for China, as it would reduce the interdependence of the two economies.
"The reality is that a hasty policy decision by Washington or Beijing could create economic conditions that would trigger an economic vortex in both countries, which is far more dangerous than observers have previously admitted", said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syria ready to welcome refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help in rebuilding the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
Today's situation in the territory is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism, he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to a normal state.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary return of refugees who were forced to leave the country as a result of terrorism, as well as unilateral economic measures that were targeted at their daily lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million people have fled Syria since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people are still in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian regime welcomes any help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that had sponsored the insurgency.
Europe responded in a big way to the Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Team Euria won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the edge of trouble in France.
The USA have now lost their sixth consecutive match on European soil, meaning they haven't won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown as Danish captain Thomas Bjorn and his team scored the 14.5 points needed to defeat the USA.
US star Phil Mickelson, who had been struggling for most of the tour, then hit a 3-par water ball on the 16th hole to give the win to Francesco Molinar.
Italian golfer Molinari then shone in all his rounds, becoming one of four players to achieve the best 5-0-0 record since the current tournament format was approved in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5 and 4 by the lowest-rated European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's highest-rated player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter, who apparently had just completed his last Ryder Cup.
An eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, Spain's Sergio Garcia became Europe's all-time leading scorer with 25.5 career points.
I don't normally cry, but I can't help myself today.
It's been a rough year.
So thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so happy, really happy, that I got the cup back.
"It's all about the team, I'm happy to have been able to help", said Garcia after the European victory.
He's toasting his fellow countryman John Ramp, who on Sunday beat American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles.
"I feel incredible pride in beating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching that guy", said Rahm, 23.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic from one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, matched only by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA has been fighting all weekend to find a fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have been putting up some top golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk of the U.S.A. said after his team's disappointing results, "I'm proud of these boys, they really fought.
We really warmed Europe up this morning.
We really didn't make it.
I take my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really, really well.
We're gonna regroup and work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup Committee to move forward.
I love those 12 guys, I'm glad I could be their captain.
I really have to go.
You've outplayed us.
Red Tide Update: Concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota counties
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows an overall decline in red tide concentrations in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, flowering spots are now being reported from Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties  indicating decreasing concentrations.
The blooming waters of the red tide stretch for about 130 miles of coastline from northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
Spots have been observed about 10 miles off the coast in Hillsborough County, but it's been relatively few spots in the past week.
Red tide has also been observed in Pasco County.
Last week, moderate concentrations were reported on the coast or in the open ocean near Pinellas County. Low to high concentrations were observed in the open ocean in Hillsborough County, lowest to high concentrations in Manatee County, lowest to high concentrations on the coast or in the open ocean near Sarasota County, lowest to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, lowest to high concentrations on the coast or in the open ocean near Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
Respiratory distress is still occurring in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No respiratory irritation was reported in northwest Florida last week.
