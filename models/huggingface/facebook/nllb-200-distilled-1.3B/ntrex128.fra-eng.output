Members of the Welsh Assembly worried about being seen as puppets
Welsh MPs are appalled by a proposal to replace their title with MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal stems from the proposal to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
In the political sphere, some Members of the Assembly feel that this could be ridiculed.
A Labour MP said his group was concerned that the acronym  rhymes with Twp and Pwp .
For non-Welsh readers: in Welsh, twp means stupid, and pwp means poop.
According to one of its members, Plaid Cymru (the Welsh Party) is not satisfied and has proposed other formulas.
The Conservative Party is reportedly  open  to a name change, but has noted that between MWP and Muppet, the distance is narrow.
In this context, in Welsh, the letter w is pronounced like the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently preparing legislation introducing the name change, has indicated that the final decision on the appointment of members of the Assembly rests with the latter.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal to designate the Assembly as the Welsh Parliament, which was widely supported.
On the question of the title of members, the Commission is leaning towards Welsh Members of Parliament (or WMPs); however, a large majority of Welsh people prefer MWP.
It seems that the members of the Assembly are making other suggestions, but the effort to reach a consensus could prove a real headache for Elin Jones, the Speaker of the Assembly, who is expected to submit a bill on the name change in the coming weeks.
The reform legislation will include further changes to the functioning of the Assembly, including rules on the exclusion of members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the Assembly will make the final decision on the name issue during the debates on the Bill.
Macedonia: referendum on changing the name of the country
Macedonians will decide on Sunday whether their country should now be called  Republic of North Macedonia .
The popular vote was held in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute between the country and its Greek neighbor, for whom Macedonia is the name of one of its provinces.
Athens has long insisted that the name Macedonia is a claim on its territory and has repeatedly vetoed its neighbour's accession to the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum, has indicated that he will not take the results into account.
However, supporters such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev maintain that the name change is only a small price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
Harlem: churches in trouble, bells of St. Martin silenced
 Older people I spoke to said that traditionally there was a bar and a church on every street corner , says Mr. Adams.
There are none today.
He thinks it's only natural that bars are rare.
Today, he says, people don't date the same way.
We used to go to the bar like we used to go to our neighbor's, but we don't anymore.
As for the churches, the funds from the sale of buildings will run out much sooner than the leaders imagine and this worries him: sooner or later they will return to the starting point.
He adds that churches could be replaced by apartment complexes, inhabited by individuals who will not help maintain the last shrines in the neighborhood.
 The people who will buy condos in these buildings will be mostly white people who will rush the closure of all the churches, as they are unlikely to become members , he worries.
Before Harlem became a black metropolis, white congregations built the two churches: Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin's 10 years later.
The original white Methodist congregation left the building in the 1930's.
A black congregation, which preached in the area, took possession of the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a black community led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who initiated a boycott of the shops on 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, where blacks struggled to get jobs or get promotions.
In 1939, a fire destroyed the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners were preparing to rebuild and ordered a new carillon,
which Father Johnson's son and successor in the leadership of St. Martin's Church, the Reverend David Johnson, proudly called the "Bells of the Poor People".
Tiffany Ng (University of Michigan), the professional player who played it in July, gave it a completely different name:  a cultural treasure  and  an irreplaceable historical instrument .
She also mentions that it is the world's first carillon played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, took his seat in front of the larger carillon at Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather claims that St. Martin did not replace him.
In recent months, there has been much talk of the architectural and contractor upheaval caused by the lay elite of the church on the one hand and the episcopal diocese on the other.
In July the parish council, a governing body composed of lay officials, informed the diocese that it was concerned that the diocese would impose the costs on it, even though it had not participated in the recruitment of professionals.
Some parishioners have lamented the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
California: 13-year-old boy injured by shark during lobster fishing party
Authorities say a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy last Saturday while he was out fishing for lobster in California on the opening day of the season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV, the San Diego television station, that he had been diving with friends for half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream for help and started to paddle to him to get him out of the water.
At first, Chad thought the boy was screaming for joy that he had a plug, but then he realized that he was actually
He was bitten.
When Hammel got close to the young man, he noticed that he had an open fracture of the collarbone.
 I shouted for everyone to come out of the water: There's a shark!, Chad explains.
The boy was taken to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he remains in critical condition.
The species of shark that caused the attack is unknown.
At a press conference, rescue leader Larry Giles said a shark had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but it was not a dangerous species.
He added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities have closed access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours, for investigation and security reasons.
Giles said that there are over 135 species of sharks, but most are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plans to take on the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's has a low-handed approach to Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and has supermarket-like shelves filled with cosmetics and beauty products and run by industry experts.
As part of a major breakthrough in the £2.8bn UK aesthetics market, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and homewares are falling, wider ranges of beauty products will be trialled in 11 stores and applied to others if the experiment proves successful.
Supermarkets are now investing in the beauty market to repurpose the space previously occupied by TVs, microwaves and other household items.
Sainsbury's said it would increase its range to 3,000 cosmetics, which will for the first time include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees ranges will also have more space in similar sectors to those of boutiques such as Boots.
The supermarket is also reviving its Boutique make-up line to offer a majority of products not tested on animals, an increasingly important criterion among young consumers.
In addition, the fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will test deals at two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened last week in Croydon, south London, and a second, due to open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Supermarket managers have to work hard to attract consumers, who are increasingly shopping online and going to local stores for everyday food.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said retail outlets will increasingly resemble supermarkets as the supermarket chain tries to counter the discount stores Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has set up Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also opened several Habitat stores since buying both chains two years ago, which the group says has boosted sales of everyday consumer goods and made acquisitions profitable.
Previous attempts to restructure the pharmaceutical and cosmetics divisions of the British chain had failed.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's attempted a partnership with Boots, but it ended following a controversy over the distribution of profits from the pharmacies in the supermarkets.
The new strategy was implemented after the sale of its 281 pharmacies for £125 million to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmaceutical chain, three years ago.
Lloyds was to play a role in introducing a wide range of high-end skincare brands in 4 stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, announced that the appearance of the beauty product shelves has been changed to improve the setting for customers.
 We have also invested in training our staff to provide sound advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet any kind of need and, thanks to the beautification of our shelves and the ideal location of our stores, our dominance in the cosmetics market is now unchallenged and changing buying habits", added Mr Mills-Hicks.
Peter Jones's anger after Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11 million deal
Anger from Dragon's Den TV star Peter Jones after announcing that host Holly Willoughby is pulling out of an £11 million contract with her home decor brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to deal with Truly, the interior decorating and accessories brand.
The two actors' work has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host announced on Instagram that she was retiring.
Holly Willoughby has angered Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, by retiring from their successful textile and interior decorating business at the last minute to focus on her new exclusive contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was furious when the TV darling revealed, during a meeting held under tension at the headquarters of the Dragon's Den star's business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new £1.5 million contracts no longer allowed him to run Truly, their home decor and accessories brand.
The Truly brand has been likened to actress Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop, and could have doubled the value of the host's estimated £11 million fortune.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones jumped on her private jet to one of her second homes outside Britain.
According to a source, Truly was by far one of Holly's top priorities.
And it's in the process of securing its future for the next two decades.
His decision left everyone speechless.
No one could have imagined what was going to happen on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
Marlow's headquarters is filled with products ready to sell.
Experts believe that the departure of the This Morning presenter, one of Britain's most bankable celebrities, could cost the company millions, due to the significant investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and underwear, and the risk of a delayed launch.
And it could end a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, parents of three children, had been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Holly Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016; Jones, 52, joined the group as president in March of that year.
The couples were on vacation together, and Peter Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is set to become the brand ambassador for M&S and will take Ant McPartlin's place as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night he would not comment on his business activities.
The debate was heated, but in the end we loved each other.
Trump mocked the media for criticizing him for his comments that some consider "unworthy of a president", and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
 Why has President Trump given in so much? ,
"He was a very funny man", he said, taking a TV reporter's voice.
I haven't given up anything at all.
He said Kim Jong-un had expressed support for a second meeting, after Trump described the first meeting, held in Singapore in June, as a major step towards denuclearisation of North Korea.
However, negotiations on denuclearisation have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that he saw no "corresponding response" from the United States to North Korea's initial disarmament measures.
He regretted that the US was, on the contrary, continuing to impose sanctions to maintain pressure.
In his rally speech Trump offers a much more optimistic outlook.
 All is well with North Korea , says the US president.
We've been on the brink of armed conflict.
 Millions of people are said to have been killed.
We have a great relationship now.
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have resulted in positive results: the end of missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of remains of American soldiers to their families.
He also justified his unusual approach to relations with Kim.
 It is so easy to play the role of president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded arena, there are barely more than 200 standing in front of me, he criticized, pointing at the crowd.
Tsunami: A devastated island and hundreds dead in Indonesia
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were supposedly not needed.
More than 10% of Lombok's population was displaced, but no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for international aid.
 Unfortunately, they have made it clear many times that they do not want international help, which complicates things a bit, regretted Ms Sumbung.
While Save the Children is setting up a team to visit Palu, it is still unclear whether fieldwork will be allowed.
The Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies should be allowed to contribute to humanitarian aid, said Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency.
Despite the constant upheavals, the country is severely underdeveloped in terms of its ability to protect itself from the ravages of nature.
Shelters have been set up in Aceh, but they are rare in other coastal areas.
Despite a warning, no alarm sirens sounded in Palu, which probably contributed to the loss of life.
Even under ideal conditions, moving from one Indonesian island to another is not easy.
Natural disasters make it more difficult to use transport.
A hospital ship that was stationed in Lombok to treat the victims is now en route to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has made reform of dilapidated infrastructure the focus of his election campaign and has spent considerable sums on repairing roads and railways.
The lack of funds, however, has undermined Mr Joko's government, which is due to stand for election next year.
The Indonesian head of state is also under pressure from persistent ethnic tensions in the country, where members of the Muslim majority practice their faith in a more conservative manner.
Over a thousand Indonesians lost their lives and tens of thousands were driven from their homes, amidst clashes in the streets between Christians and Muslims armed with machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Watch: Liverpool forward Daniel Sturridge makes the equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saves Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea, scoring in the 89th minute, Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri as he was about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal, and his team was leading 1-0.
He shot the ball to his left, before missing a shot to the second post.
The ball flew over the repair surface before heading for the top right corner of the net.
The ball eventually hit Kepa Arrizabalaga and ended up at the bottom of the cage.
"I was just trying to get in position, to get the ball but players like Shaq always shoot as far as they can, so I tried to buy as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante approaching to check and without really thinking I decided to shoot.
Chelsea led 1-0 at half-time after a goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward stalked a pass to Mateo Kovacic, before sliding into midfield and sprinting to Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick back and forth in midfield,
Then he fired a beautiful deep shot that brought Hazard to the surface.
Hazard overran the defence and finished his run in the net from the second post, with a left-footed shot behind Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 3pm at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Indonesia: tsunami death toll rises to 832
The disaster management agency said Sunday morning that the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami was 832.
Many residents are trapped under the rubble of buildings destroyed by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that hit the country on Friday and caused waves up to 6 meters high, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with its population of over 380,000, was covered with rubble from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing a woman
A murder investigation has been opened after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
At 7:55 a.m., the 44-year-old woman was found stabbed to death in John Street, Grayson Mews, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are urging residents in the area who have seen or heard anything to come forward.
Police Captain Brian O'Hagan made the following statement:  The investigation has just begun, but I would ask anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I'm calling in particular the taxi drivers, who may have caught something on their dash cam and ask them to provide us with any information crucial to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the murdered woman was found at a property in Birkenhead where she was residing.
This morning, people claiming to know the woman showed up at the crime scene and asked questions about where she was found.
The investigation is ongoing and police said they are notifying the victim's next of kin.
A cab driver has just been denied access to his apartment in Grayson Mews as police are not allowing anyone in or out of the building.
The news left him speechless.
Residents have just been informed that the building will be inaccessible for several hours.
A police officer said the entire area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman in tears appeared at the scene,
I'm going to say it again: "This is too horrible".
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were stationed inside the cordon, and one outside.
Several officers were watching the building from the inside of the cordon.
Anyone with information is asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crime Stoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, according to the 30 September 247 register.
Parliament: statue of Cromwell, last victim of an attempt to rewrite history
The ban would be a just reversal of events, given the destruction of countless religious and cultural assets in England by its puritan supporters, such as the fanatical Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society considered Mr. Crick's proposal  unreasonable  and called it  a revisionist attempt .
The president of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, said that given the current debate over the removal of statues, it was obvious that the one of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster would not be spared.
Cromwell neither ordered nor led the iconoclasm during the English Civil Wars.
It is likely that he was sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent portrait of Cromwell, sculpted by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a testament to the esteem in which he was held in the nineteenth century and is part of the historiography of a personality many of us still celebrate.
Mr Goldsmith said in the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more so in the late nineteenth century than today, as a defender of Parliament against external pressures, I mean the monarchy of course.
Whether this representation is accurate or not is a continuing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict that broke out in the middle of the 17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a particularly recognizable figure who represents one side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of note and commemoration.
China: Pig kills farmer
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southeastern China.
The man, identified as M. Yuan, was found dead, his artery slit and covered in blood near a pig market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject pigs with vaccines in a pig farm in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, May 30, 2005.
He was said to have travelled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday, with the aim of selling 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the nearby pigsty was open.
He claims that a huge male pig was inside and that blood was flowing from his mouth.
A forensic report confirms that the 250-kilogram animal mutilated the rancher to death.
According to the Guiyang Evening News, Mr. Wu, the rancher's cousin, said that  his legs were crushed and covered in blood .
Security cameras show Mr. Yuan arriving at the market at 04:40 on Thursday to feed his animals.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed Mr. Yuan did not belong to the farmer or his cousin.
A market official told the Evening News that the animal was locked up to prevent further incidents and allow police to gather evidence.
The family of farmer Mr. Yuan and market leaders are reportedly negotiating compensation.
Although the facts are rare, pig attacks on people have been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the husband.
Ten years ago, a 300-pound pig pinned a Welsh farmer to his tractor before his wife managed to drive him away.
In 2012, after a rancher in Oregon was eaten by his pigs, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that the animal was not aggressive, but that the taste of blood could cause this type of behavior.
 They're rather playful animals,
Very curious kids... they have no intention of doing any harm.
He said that all we had to do was show them the respect they deserve.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are expected to cause heavy rainfall in the southeastern United States
As forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over colder waters off the northeastern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rainfall to northeastern Mexico and southwestern United States in the coming days.
Winds were blowing at 135 km/h (Category 1 hurricane) since 5am Eastern time on Sunday, while Rosa was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The hurricane is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and moves eastward toward the west coast of the United States.As it approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a storm on Monday, Hurricane Rosa will bring intense tropical moisture northward into the southwestern United States.
Up to 10 inches of rain will fall in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical humidity combined with the approaching depression will create widespread torrential rains in the southwest over the coming days.
At local level, rainfall of between 2.5 and 10 cm will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and potential landslides in the desert.
Rainfall will be between 5 and 7.5 cm per hour in some areas, particularly in southern Nevada and Arizona, due to the intense tropical humidity.
It's expected to rain between 5 and 10 inches in parts of the southwest, including much of Arizona.
Tropical rains that are scattered can cause sudden flooding and rapid deterioration of conditions.
It is strongly discouraged to venture into the desert on foot because of the threat of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rains could turn the canyons into raging rivers and thunderstorms will produce gusty winds and dust storms in places.
The approaching depression will cause heavy local rainfall in some southern regions of the country along the California coast.
Total rainfall may exceed 1.3 cm, which could cause low debris flows and make the road slippery.
It could be the first rains of the dry season in the region.
Scattered tropical showers will reach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday morning, then intensify later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will fall in all four corners of the country on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
Significant temperature variations are expected in October across the US due to cooling in the Arctic, but the climate in the tropics will remain warm.
which sometimes causes a drastic change in weather over short distances.
The central United States, which will experience significant temperature variations on Sunday, is a prime example.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, or between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, the difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, persistent summer heat will try to infiltrate and intensify again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience a warm early October, with temperatures hovering around 26 degrees covering the southern plains and other areas of the northeast.
Mercury could reach 85 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the season average.
Multi-day forecasts indicate that temperatures are expected to be above average in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial is attracting over 20 million viewers.
Broadcast on six television stations on Thursday, the sensational hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexually assaulting her in the 1980s, were watched by more than 20 million people.
As the political impasse continues, the broadcasters have interrupted their regular Friday programming to announce a hoax: an agreement devised by Jeff Flake, the Arizona senator, to allow the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
In front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Christine Ford said she was 100% certain that Kavanaugh, while under the influence of alcohol, had engaged in physical acts and attempted to remove his clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate tirade, claimed he was also 100% certain that this had never happened.
According to a Nielsen report, the trial likely reached an audience of over 20.4 million people.
The company calculated the number of viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers for other networks broadcasting the trial, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen does not always manage to estimate the number of people watching TV at work.
By comparison, the trial drew as many people as a football game or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose hosts largely supported Kavanaugh's nomination, was the most watched channel on the day of the audition, averaging 5.69 million viewers.
ABC was in second place with a 3.26 million viewership.
CBS (3.1 million), NBC (2.94 million), MSNBC (2.89 million) and CNN (2.52 million) followed, also according to Nielsen.
Interest did not diminish after the hearing.
Flake was at the center of the drama that was playing out Friday.
After the moderate Republican's office released a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras showed a scene in which the senator is being harassed by female protesters as he attempts to take the elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
Flake looked down for several minutes as CNN broadcast the live sequence of the arrest.
"Don't look away, look at me", one of the women said.
Do you really believe he's telling the truth?
You hold power when so many women are destitute.
Before the elevator doors closed, Flake said his office had issued a statement and would say more at the committee meeting.
All cable and broadcast networks were covering the hearing live a few hours later as the Judiciary Committee prepared to vote on the process to advance Kavanaugh's nomination by the full Senate.
Flake, however, indicated that a week-long investigation should first be conducted by the FBI into the allegations against the candidate, which the minority Democrats were demanding.
Flake was partly convinced by talking to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
He made his decision after talking to Coons and several other senators afterwards.
His choice was a heavy one, because Republicans would not have actually gotten the votes to approve Kavanaugh's nomination without a preliminary inquiry.
President Trump authorized the FBI to investigate Brett Kavanaugh's sexual assault allegations.
Britain: May accuses Brexit opponents of "small politics"
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "petty politics" to the detriment of Britain's future and national interest.
May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another exchange with the paper, which published a photo of Theresa May on the cover, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, continued his attacks on her so-called Chequers plans, saying that the free trade proposal between Britain and the EU was  purely ridiculous .
Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of being behind the death of the LSU quarterback.
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting that resulted in the death of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
Dyteon Simpson, also 20, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Authorities released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said that Sims lost his glasses during the altercation.
The glasses were found at the crime scene and contained Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, a subsidiary of CBS.
During his interrogation, Simpson confessed to the police that he was responsible for Wayde's death.
According to his lawyer, his bail was set at $350,000.
The Baton Rouge Parish Medical Examiner's office released a preliminary report Friday, which determines that death was caused by a gunshot wound to the head and lodged in the neck.
The police department acknowledges the assistance received by the Louisiana State Fugitive Task Force, the state police forensic laboratory, Southern University police, and citizens in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement for their commitment and pursuit of justice.
Sims was only 20 years old.
The 6-foot-1, 200-pound player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated and in shock" after hearing of Wayde's death.
 We fear this kind of event all the time, lamented Wade.
Mexico City: A volcano spews ash
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern districts of Mexico's capital.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Center advised Mexicans to move away from the volcano after the crater recorded a spike in activity, with 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The center monitored several rumblings and tremors coming from the Popocatepetl.
On social media, images showed thin layers of ash covering car windshields in Mexico City neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity at the volcano, 72 km from the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, nicknamed Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Catalonia: clashes between police and separatists as independence vote anniversary approaches
Six arrests were made in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between pro-independence protesters and riot police, as thousands of opposition protesters joined protests to mark the first anniversary of the referendum that divided Catalonia.
Before being repelled by riot police, masked separatists threw eggs and colored powder at them, creating dust clouds in the streets, which are not usually filled with tourists.
Gun battles also broke out later in the day, as police used batons to contain the clashes.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanting "never forget, never forgive" faced unionist supporters chanting "long live Spain".
14 protesters with minor injuries were treated, according to local media.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which was declared illegal by Madrid but celebrated by pro-secession Catalans, tensions remain high in the independence region.
An overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, despite a low turnout, as opponents of secession largely boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent Catalans from accessing polling stations in the region.
Independence groups had camped out on Friday night to block a demonstration in support of the national police.
The same thing happened, but she was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who was participating with his wife in the separatist demonstration, said he no longer had any hope for Catalonia's independence.
We witnessed a big moment last year.
My parents were crying for the chance to vote, but now we are at a dead end, he laments.
Despite their crucial, albeit slim, victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many popular leaders in exile or in jail awaiting trial for organising the referendum and declaring Catalonia's independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the demonstration in support of the police on his phone, believes that politicians are responsible for blocking the situation, on both sides.
 The tension is only going up , he regrets.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison awaiting trial since last year, announced his intention to stand in the European Parliament elections next year.
 It is for me the best way to denounce the decline of democratic values and the repression unleashed by the Spanish government, he adds.
Arrest in Londonderry: men hit a house in their car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after breaking into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 7.30pm local time.
Police Captain Bob Blemmings reported that the doors and walls were damaged.
The car was also reportedly shot with arrows.
Livingston wins the game 1-0 against the Rangers thanks to Menga
Dolly Menga's first goal assures Livingston's win
Livingston's recently promoted side surprised Rangers by beating Steven Gerrard, the current manager of Ibrox, for a second win in 18 games.
Menga's goal made all the difference and allowed Gary Holt's team to take second place in the standings, tied with Hibernian.
Gerrard's men are unbeaten away from home in the Premier League this season, and face Hearts on Sunday, who lead by eight points.
But before that, the Rangers will face the Vienna Rapid in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston's team extends its unbeaten run in the division by six games, and head coach Holt, who has replaced Kenny Miller since last month, can boast that he has not yet lost a single game.
Livingston missed an opportunity against a blunt opponent.
Holt's team could have taken the lead well before they scored, as their direct approach was putting the Rangers in trouble.
Scott Robinson attempted to break through but was caught in front of the opposing goal; this was followed by a late intervention by Alan Lithgow, on a header by Craig Halkett.
The Livingston team let the Rangers have possession of the ball, knowing they could get in the way with some well-crafted tactics.
That's where the decisive goal came in.
The Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston attempted an opening; Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to corner Menga, who took a touchdown and scored a midfield goal.
At this point, the Rangers dominated the game but found themselves facing an impenetrable defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was rarely worried.
The second half was the same, although Alfredo Morelos forced a stop from Kelly.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor kicked a shot from Scott Pittman, while Lithgow managed to foil one of Livingston's shots.
The Livingston goalkeeper fought back and protected his cage, while two penalties were refused by the referee, one for Halkett's provocation directed at Glenn Middleton and the other for a foul.
The  phenomenon  of the Livingston - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland, at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and results that are breathtaking for Livingston.
They've all been excellent and continue to exceed expectations on this uphill climb.
Their style and team composition have been virtually unchanged since their return to the top, but Holt is largely credited with motivating a team since his arrival.
It's a great place with a lot of great players.
Captain Halkett's defense was grandiose and beautifully organized, and Menga was able to keep Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall breathless for the duration of the game.
Unfortunately, the Rangers were not inspired.
Despite a good level of achievement with Gerrard, they were not up to their previous talent.
They missed one last opportunity and only managed to penetrate the opposing side once, a warning to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
President Erdogan received a mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday 29 September, the Turkish and German leaders met for a relaxed breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
Various issues were discussed, such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then flew to Cologne for the inauguration of one of the largest mosques.
One of the largest Turkish communities abroad lives in this city.
Citing security concerns, the police prevented 25,000 protesters from gathering outside the building, while many supporters were able to get close enough to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurds, have raised their voices, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to their country.
The split that emerged from the protests reflects this double vision of Erdogan: a visitor welcomed as a hero by some Turkish Germans and described as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist killed after collision with car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred at around 10:15am local time, near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road from Deptford to the south-east of the town.
The driver of the vehicle stopped, the ambulance arrived on the scene, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The accident occurred several months after a cyclist was killed on Chiders Street, about a mile from the accident on Saturday.
London police said officers were doing everything they could to identify the man and notify his family.
Roads have been closed and buses diverted, and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: 6 officers injured in riot
The head of the high-security men's prison said that six prison guards were injured in a riot.
The riot started at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire at around 0930 local time on Sunday and is still out of control.
Specialist riot police were dispatched to unblock the situation, involving eight inmates and contained in one wing of the prison.
Officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A prison management spokesman said:  Specially trained personnel have been deployed to restore order to HMP Long Lartin Prison.
Six officers were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible will be held accountable to the police and their sentences may be extended. 
Over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals, are being held at HM Long Lartin Prison.
In June, the director of the prison was hospitalized after being assaulted by a prisoner.
In October last year, riot police were sent to the prison to quell a serious disturbance: prisoners attacked staff with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa: Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City threatened by flash floods (which could benefit drought-stricken areas)
It's rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but it's likely to do so early next week as Hurricane Rosa heads toward the southwest desert with what energy it has left, and the region could be hit by flash floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head straight for Phoenix on Tuesday, with showers as early as Monday night.
The Phoenix-based National Weather Service said in a tweet that  only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the depression or tropical storm stage within a 300-kilometer radius of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) had stopped 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest estimates from the National Hurricane Center are for 5 to 10 inches of rain, and up to 15 inches in some places in the Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin are expected to record 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with isolated total measurements of up to 10 cm.
The rains from Rosa could be lifesaving for drought-stricken areas that are not at risk of flash floods.
Although the risk of flooding should not be taken lightly, the rain could be beneficial for the south-west region, given the current drought situation.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring System, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least one extreme drought, the second-worst category, reports weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa is making its way to the coast of the Baja California Peninsula.
Still strong on Sunday morning, with winds of up to 135 km/h, Rosa was located 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at 20 km/h.
The storm meets the cold waters of the Pacific and loses its strength.
It's expected to make landfall on the Mexican coast with hurricane force Monday afternoon or Monday night.
In some parts of Mexico, heavy rainfall could result in flood risk.
 A total of between 7.5 and 15 cm of rainfall is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora and could reach up to 25 cm, weather.com said.
Rosa will then cross northward through Mexico with the force of a tropical storm and will reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, crossing Arizona and southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
 Torrential rains are expected in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert and are the main danger,  the National Hurricane Center said.
It is estimated that these rains will lead to potentially deadly flash floods and debris flows in arid areas, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4:00 a.m. local time on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital, but his condition is stable.
Avon and Somerset Police said they arrested the four young men (aged 17, 18 and 20) overnight on the Radstock side.
Officers have issued a call for anyone who may have filmed the scene with their phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh was a victim of the Democrats' malice and anger
 A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and outrageous methods of the Democratic Party, Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump claimed that Kavanaugh had been a victim of the Democrats' malice and anger throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh spoke before Congress on Thursday, energetically and emotionally rejecting the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford, who accuses him of sexually assaulting her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that the American people witnessed Kavanaugh's intelligence and courage today.
 A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most accomplished lawyers with a brilliant career in public service,  he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president made indirect reference to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I am not a candidate, but I am more involved than ever , he said.
 That's why I'm fighting on all fronts for great candidates. 
Trump said the Democrats were on a mission of  resistance and de obstruction .
The first decisive procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place by Friday, a Republican aide told CNN.
Indonesia: Earthquake and tsunami kill hundreds and the toll continues to rise
On Saturday, authorities said at least 384 people had died, most of them washed up on the beaches by huge waves as an earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Celebes.
On Friday, hundreds of people were gathering for a festival on the beach in Palu when six-meter-high waves overwhelmed the beach as night fell, claiming many lives and destroying everything in their path.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake preceded the tsunami.
 When the tsunami threat came yesterday, everyone was still on the beach. People did not flee immediately, it cost them their lives, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), told a press conference in Jakarta.
 The tsunami did not come alone. it took cars, pieces of wood, houses, everything with it, Nugroho explained, adding that the tsunami had moved in the open sea at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people were able to save their lives by climbing trees, he added.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial images released by the disaster management agency show destroyed buildings and shops, deformed and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquakes were felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday's earthquake was 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which borders a long narrow bay, could have amplified the size of the tsunami, she said.
According to Nugroho, the damage is extensive; thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
Bodies were found trapped under the rubble of ruined buildings, he added, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said the loss of life and property could be greater on the 300km coast north of Palu, a region called Donggala, closest to the epicenter of the quake.
Communications were  completely paralyzed  from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
 The situation is dramatic and could well get worse, she added.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not releasing information that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived by the time the alert was issued.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building frantically shouting to passersby on the street that a tsunami is approaching.
A few minutes later, a wall of water fell on the coast, washing away buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to immediately authenticate the images.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a general power outage that cut off all communications in Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The army has begun to deliver aid by cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, officials said, but evacuees are still in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has reopened as part of the rescue operation, but will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia: tsunami death toll rises to more than 800
This is a tragedy.
World Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely in Palu, where they found shelter in the shelters set up in the courtyard of their offices.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed", he says.
This is a tragedy.
When aid groups began to assist the victims, some complained that highly experienced foreign aid workers were not allowed to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funds, supplies and personnel may enter the territory only if the affected site is declared a national disaster area.
And it's not yet.
 The disaster is still considered a regional one, explains Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
As soon as the government declares this a national disaster, international assistance will be available, but we are still waiting.
When the second night after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday fell on Palu, the relatives of the missing still hoped for a miracle.
On Saturday, a little boy was found in the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers pulled out a woman who had been buried under the rubble for two days, near her mother's body.
The Indonesian national paragliding team coach, Gendon Subandono, had been preparing two of the missing athletes for the Asian Games, which were held a few days earlier in Indonesia.
Other students were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, Mandagi added.
 As a senior paraglider, I have experienced my own tragedies, he explains.
In the hours following the news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse in the paragliding community, Mr. Gendon said he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the athletes in Palu who were attending the festival on the beach.
Her messages went unanswered.
I don't think they ever got my messages.
In Newport on the Levee, thieves steal $26,750 while refilling an ATM
On Friday morning, robbers extorted $26,750 from a Brink's agent who was loading a vending machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle was emptying a vending machine at the amusement park and preparing to fill it, Detective Inspector Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While he was busy, a man appeared behind the Brink's employee and stole a bag of cash intended for the ATM.
Witnesses reported seeing many suspects leaving the scene, but police did not say how many people were involved.
Anyone with information about their identities is asked to contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is now calling himself Ye.
Announcing the news on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote:  Formerly known as Kanye West. 
West, 41, who has been using the name Ye for some time, used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The rapper made the change just before he was due to appear on Saturday Night Live, where he is set to present his new album, Yandhi.
She replaces Ariana Grande, who canceled her appearance for emotional reasons, the show's creator said.
In addition to being the abbreviation for his current professional alias, this nickname also has religious significance for West.
I think Ye is the most used word in the Bible, where it means you, West explained earlier this year, referring to the title of his album with his host Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us.
I went from Kanye, which means  the only , to Ye - the reflection of good, evil, confusion, everything.
This album is a reflection of who we are.
West isn't the only rapper known to change his name.
Sean Combs has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has worked with West in the past, also played the dash and the capital letters.
In Mexico, AMLO declares that he will never use military force against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians, nearly 50 years after law enforcement's bloody reprisals against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that  he would never use military force to repress the Mexican people. 
On October 2, 1968, troops opened fire on a peaceful demonstration, killing 300 people as student movements took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support Mexican youth by providing monthly student allowances and opening more free public universities.
He believes that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are driving young people to join criminal gangs.
The US should double its funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US is expected to double its funding for research in this area, according to Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and artificial intelligence expert who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements come after several US government actors made AI-related announcements, while there is no official AI strategy in the US.
In parallel, China presented its roadmap last year: it plans to become the leader in AI innovation by 2030.
 Doubling funding for AI research would be a good start, as all other countries are a step ahead of the US, and we are looking for the next big breakthrough in AI, says Lee.
Doubling the funding could double the chances that the next key step in AI will come from the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book  AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order  was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's largest AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the top-ranked American Othello player. He later joined the management team at Microsoft Research and became president of Google's China branch.
Lee has previously competed in technology competitions run by the US government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition would be held, in order to identify visionaries.
According to Lee, American researchers often have to work hard to get government funding.
 It is not China that is taking over academic leaders, it is business , says Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have recruited big names in academia to work on AI.
Lee added that changes in immigration policies could also support US efforts on IAD.
 I think green cards should be automatically granted to AI researchers , he says.
China's State Council unveiled its plan for the development of next-generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to members of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will involve partners from industry and academia.The White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF, meanwhile, is currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
In parallel, US legislation to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not taken any action for several months.
Macedonians vote on the name of their country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia, a change that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's application to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, one of whose provinces is called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbour represents a right to its territory and has vetoed its accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments signed an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change would affect the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign had raised doubts about obtaining the minimum 50% turnout required to validate the referendum.
The question of the referendum was:  Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU under the terms of the agreement signed with Greece? 
According to supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, this is the price to pay for Macedonia, which survived the collapse of Yugoslavia, to join organisations such as the EU and NATO.
 I have come today to vote for the future of my country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the aegis of the European Union.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would follow the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission announced that no irregularities had been detected at 1 p.m.
But turnout was only 16%, up from 34% at the same time in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 which had mobilized 66% of registered voters.
 I came to vote for my children.  Our place is in Europe, says Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko participated in the referendum and voted for the name change, to open the vote for NATO and European Union membership, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov is preparing a small stage and has seats in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
 We want to enter the EU and NATO, but we want to enter through the big door, Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and participate in Eurasian integration.
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership will allow Macedonia to benefit from the necessary investment.
 I think a large majority will be in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens want to join the EU and NATO , said Mr Zaev after he had tabled his ballot.
He added that a "yes" would be a "confirmation of our future".
According to a poll published on Monday by the Institute for Policy Research in Macedonia, between 30 and 43 percent of voters are said to be planning to participate in the referendum, which is below the expected turnout.
Another poll, conducted by the Macedonian Telma channel, put the turnout at 57%.
70% of the participants intending to vote said they would vote  yes .
For the referendum to be valid, it needs 50% of the vote plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first major blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it took power in May last year.
Decisive action: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City breaks through Brighton's defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated defending champions Brighton in Manchester and won the match 2-0 on Saturday, at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero's goal in the 65th minute seemed like the easiest thing in the world for the player to do.
The Argentine scorer received the ball in the middle of the field, at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defenders before plunging onto the field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He passed a defender before knocking out the others just outside Brighton's goal.
Then he passed the ball to Sterling, on his left.
The English forward took the opportunity to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to cheat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot from the right side of the net.
 Aguero has some problems with his feet, Pep Guardiola, the team's coach, told reporters.
We said he'd play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored at that moment.
But it was Sterling who gave the Skyblues the initial lead in the Premier League game,
From the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball right on Brighton's pitch.
He sent it to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane made a couple of touches before leading Sterling to the second pole.
The Skyblues forward sent the ball into the net just before it slid off the field.
City will play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55pm on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the rioters against the Rockies.
With the Nationals out of the playoff race, there was no reason to go to another game.
But Scherzer, who is very competitive, hopes to play the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only in the event of a playoff game for the Rockies, true legends against the Los Angeles Dodgers of the National League West Division.
The Rockies lost 5-2 to the Nationals Friday night, but they're still looking to secure their division title.
Even if this game is not on the line, we want to be on the field in Denver, with this atmosphere, with this crowd, and against a team that will probably play at the highest level I'll ever face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to be a part of it?
The Nationals have yet to announce a starting pitcher for Sunday, but would be inclined to give way to Scherzer in this situation.
Scherzer, who will be making his 34th start, will be in practice Thursday and pitch on his usual day off Sunday.
The Washington righty is 18-7 with a 2.53 earned run average and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's speeches in West Virginia
The President alluded to the situation that his support for Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court has created by speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
 All our actions will have an impact in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
It is a major issue. I am not a candidate, but I am more involved than ever. That is why I am fighting on all fronts for great candidates", he said.
Trump went on: "You see this horrible, really horrible, radical group of Democrats, you see it at work.
And they are determined to take back power by any means necessary.
They don't care who they hurt, who they crush to take power and control, and that's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give it to them.
The Democrats are on a mission of resistance and obstruction.
 You can see it over the last four days , he added, before calling the Democrats people  angry, mean and lying. 
He mentioned the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee and Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which earned him a standing ovation.
Do you remember what he said?
Did you leak the document?
Ha ha, of course.
No, no, I'm waiting for one. That was really bad body language, the worst I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is not the big community it used to be.
He's not tolerant of people who express their opinions.
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last in a line of Labour MPs who are considered unwelcome, all for expressing our views.
My colleague Joan Ryan was treated the same way because she spoke out against anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, I was censored because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
Ironically, these are topics on which Jeremy himself disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour rally on Friday said:  We want the rally to be inclusive and productive. 
This is exactly what the Friday evening general meetings were like during my eight years as a Labour Party MP.
Unfortunately, today this is not the case for many rallies and the promise of milder and more respectful policies has long been forgotten, if ever taken into account.
It has become clear that contrary opinions are no longer tolerated within the party and that each opinion is judged on its acceptability by the party leaders.
It started shortly after Jeremy took office, when colleagues with whom I thought I shared the same political views began to expect me to turn my back and take positions that were contrary to my beliefs, whether on national security or the EU internal market.
Every time I spoke publicly, and no matter what I said, there was an abusive tirade on social media, calling for me to resign, denouncing the policies of the center, telling me that I shouldn't be a member of the party.
And it's not just my experience.
I am actually luckier than some of my colleagues because the comments I received were political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of these colleagues, who face a barrage of sexist and racist remarks every day, but who do not give up.
One of the most disappointing things about current policy is the normalisation of different forms of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that big community and the party is shrinking with motions of no confidence and changes to the selection rules.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last couple of years: look down, don't express my ideas so loudly, and everything will be fine.
But I'm not in politics to do that.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy because the negligence of the Thatcher government had caused the collapse of my classroom, and since then I have wanted to work for better public services for those who need them most, whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I have never hidden my political ambitions, even during the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be disturbed by my political positions and my differences with the current party leaders.
All I would like to say to those who supported the motion on Friday is that the country is heading towards a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services. I think this is not really the time to waste time and energy debating my loyalty to the party leader.
My only message is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my constituents, whether Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of withdrawal or opportunism will stop me from acting for the causes I stand for, which are in your interests.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Ayr is still undefeated .
Two late trials may have skewed the final result, but there is no doubt about it: Ayr deserved this triumph after the intense one-day game of the Scottish Rugby Union Under 15 Championship.
The team now occupies the top of the standings and becomes the only undefeated team in the championship.
In the end, it was their superior defense and the way they took the chances that allowed them to open the scoring.
"Until now, we have been tested. But we remain undefeated, so I must consider myself happy", he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose praised Ayr:  Good for them, they were more efficient than us and knew how to seize opportunities. 
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute try, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in a good position, but a yellow card for Scotland's Rory Hughes, released for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to make the numbers speak.
Climo made things worse for Ayr with a penalty, before, just in the half, he scored and converted a solo try to make it 17-5 for Ayr at halftime.
Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try, converted by Baggot, narrowed the gap to five points.
This was followed by a long wait due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who left the field on a stretcher.
Blair Macpherson, Ayr's acting captain, was then given a yellow card and, again, Melrose tried his luck with an unchanged try from Bruce Colvine, which created palpable tension.
But the home team got back on their feet and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for tackling Climo when he didn't have the ball, from the penalty area, MacPherson touched the back of Ayr's advancing maul.
Climo turned the game around, as he has almost every time since the replay, after Kyle Rowe collected a box kick from David Armstrong and sent winger Gregor Henry away for the team's fifth home try.
The star of Still Game is getting into the restaurant business.
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, decided to pursue a career in catering.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes and co-hosts with his longtime stage partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the show's finale, and Kiernan seems to be gearing up for the post-Craiglang.
According to official records, he is a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source in the Scottish Sun revealed that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the thriving restaurant scene in Glasgow.

From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, naval bases display the following motorcycle:
It's a duty to get her back.
Across the blockaded Bolivia, the memory of a coast lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still very much alive, as is the desire to sail the Pacific Ocean once again.
The hope has not been so palpable for decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
 Bolivia has the will, the spirit of unity and serenity, and of course expects a positive outcome , explains Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will be watching the International Court of Justice ruling on big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim.Bolivia hopes that after decades of sporadic negotiations, Chile will be forced to negotiate an agreement for a sovereign ocean crossing for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia (who faces a controversial re-election fight next year), also has a lot to say about the decision to be made on Monday.
 We are so close to being able to return to the Pacific Ocean , he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court's ruling in favor of Chile is unlikely to change much, even if it were positive.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to grant Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice issued its decision six months after the last arguments shows that the case  was not complicated , explains Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from helping Bolivia's cause, the last four years may have even hurt it.
 The problem of access to the sea has been diverted by the current Bolivian administration, said Zárate.
Morales' bellicose rhetoric has undermined any remaining Chilean goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to exchange, but after that it will be very difficult to organize talks.
The last exchange of ambassadors between the two countries took place in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision-making was abnormally quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia  an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile  and a chance to  end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits , he said.
Calzadilla also challenged the fact that Morales - who remains to this day one of Latin America's most popular presidents - was using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
 Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean, he added.
 The Court's decision is an opportunity to see that we must let go of the past. 
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will only happen when it can trust the United States.
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea's foreign minister, said his country would not give up its nuclear weapons until it had confidence in Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to honour the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
He was speaking at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears poised to revive nuclear diplomacy in the deadlock more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Jong Un, the current leader of North Korea.
Ri says it is "chimeric" to think that the continued sanctions and US opposition to a declaration that would end the Korean War will make the North bow.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration unless Pyongyang takes significant disarmament measures first.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But the seriousness of Pyongyang's decision to give up an arsenal that it considers the only guarantee of its security is debatable.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month, to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest headwear trends, perhaps soon available in your stores
If you want to add XXL pieces to your hat collection or 100% sun protection, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne showcased their crazy oversize hat collections at a PE19 fashion show that paid tribute to the style of Paris Fashion Week.
More extravagant hats each flooded Instagram this summer, and designers decided to incorporate their wacky pieces into the shows.
Valentino's flagship piece was an eccentric beige hat with a wide edge that evoked a feather, which swallowed the heads of the models.
Other oversize accessories included jewelled watermelons, a witch hat and even a pineapple.
Thom Browne also unveiled a collection of original masks, just in time for Halloween.
Most of the masks had the lips sewn together and were more Hannibal Lecter than Haute Couture.
One creation looked like a scuba gear, with a tube and glasses, while another was reminiscent of a melted ice cone.
And if you follow fashion trends, then you're in luck.
According to fashion observers, the imposing hats could be coming to your shopping streets.
XXL hats follow in the wake of the  Bomba , the wide-brimmed straw hat that stars pull off, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand that markets this hard-to-wear hat that has flooded social media has unveiled another of its flagship designs on the podium: a straw beach bag almost as big as the swimsuit model who wore it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, adorned with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, was the centrepiece of Jacquemus's PE19 La Riviera show at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see the big hats and beach bags hit stores next summer.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence.This trend continued in 2018 with new excellent exam results enhanced by collective and individual success in sport, art, music and other community activities.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the highest level of service to pupils and their parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their pupils for higher education, their chosen careers and their place as citizens of the world.
As an education sector able to design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we find that contemporary languages remain popular and desirable subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you are speaking to his head.
If you speak to him in his language, you're speaking to his heart.
It reminds us that we cannot rely on English to build relationships and build trust with people in other countries.
If you look at the excellent test scores this year, you see that languages are at the top of the ranking, with the highest pass rates in independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained the highest grade, A.
Data from the 74 SCIS member schools show that 72% of pupils achieved the highest grade, A, in Mandarin, as did 72% of pupils who studied German, 69% of pupils who studied French and 63% of pupils who studied Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as skills that are absolutely essential for children and young people in the future.
Now languages as subjects are organised alongside science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the curricula of independent schools and other schools.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission found that 17% of the difficulties employers face in recruiting candidates are related to insufficient language skills.
Language skills are therefore increasingly vital in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more jobs requiring languages, these skills are essential in our globalised world.
Regardless of the career choice, a person who speaks a second language will benefit from this lasting skill in the future.
Being able to communicate directly with foreigners will automatically put the multilingual person ahead of his competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of 4,000 adults in the UK, 75% of them did not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation.
This is why investing in language learning is important for children today.
By learning more languages, especially those of emerging economies, children will have a better chance of finding rewarding jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Many will focus on contemporary classical languages, while others will teach languages considered important for the UK in the 2020 perspective, including Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever your child's preferences, there are several languages available in independent schools, with staff specialised in the field.
Independent schools in Scotland want to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
It is clear that today, in a global business environment, languages remain of major importance for the future of the country.
Modern languages must be considered as  international communication skills .
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
You have to do it right.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make his Lakers debut Saturday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans watching LeBron James debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, the Lakers' head coach, announced that James will play in the preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But we don't know how many minutes he's gonna play.
"More than one, less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would likely play for a limited few minutes.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the pre-season schedule, which includes six games.
At this point in my career, I don't need pre-season games to be ready.
Trump's campaign in West Virginia (YouTube channel)
President Donald Trump is starting a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Other stops are planned, including in states like Tennessee and Mississippi where the president is popular.
With the confirmation vote for the vacant Supreme Court seat postponed, Trump is seeking to rally support for the upcoming midterm elections and prevent the Republicans from losing control of Congress in the November vote.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can I watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7:00 PM Eastern time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch it online below, live on YouTube.
Trump is expected to address the sexual assault hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh this week, and the Senate confirmation vote on Kavanaugh is expected to be delayed by up to a week while the FBI investigates.
But this series of meetings is primarily about helping Republicans gain ground in the November election.
According to Reuters, the US president said in his campaign that the five meetings were meant to encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives.
 Congressional oversight is such a key part of his agenda that the president will visit as many states as possible at the start of this busy election campaign, a Trump team spokesman told Reuters, who declined to be named.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, tonight's rally, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could draw fans from all over Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract media attention from Pittsburgh.
Saturday will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia in a month, a state he won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, the Republican candidate for West Virginia Senate, who is trailing in the polls.
 It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to revive him in the polls, said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: Team USA ready to fight for hope as Sunday's singles draws near
After three singles, Saturday afternoon's foursomes may well represent what this Ryder Cup is missing.
The swinging movement of the eels is a sporting concept invented from scratch but which the players sincerely believe in, and more than ever in tournaments like this one.
Where would they find the momentum now?
They were six points ahead and now four, so that gives us a bit of wings", said Jordan Spieth as he left for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, with four points and 12 more to play.
The Americans, Spieth said, feel they have a bit of a wind in their sails and have every reason to be encouraged, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas who have been playing together all day and can boast of getting three points each out of four.
Spieth has been terribly effective from tee to green and is setting an example.
The energetic cheers intensified as his play progressed, and a crucial putt allowed him to tie the game in the fourth as he and Thomas were leading two downs after two holes.
His putt, which won the game on the 15th hole, drew a similar outcry from those who tell you he believes the American team is still in contention.
 You really have to stay determined and focus on your game, Spieth said.
That's all any of these players have left now.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as evidenced by the history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European pair have won four of their last four matches and are not allowed to make mistakes.
Not only were the Moliwoods the only team to miss a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also missed it on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the final nine holes on Friday morning.
This series, the way their energy seems to flow between them and the raving crowd, they're the players to beat on Sunday, and there's no player more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari to delight in a potential European win as the sun sets on Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
But it is still too early to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat Sergio Garcia, the morning's four-ball hero, as he teamed up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine strokes sent the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they could never get out of.
But on Sundays, no one is there to help you.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch up close because of the interactions between the peers, the advice they give and the advice they don't give, and how a strategy can tip over in the blink of an eye.
Europe has been better as a team so far and has made a big step forward on the final day, but this round of games also proved that the Americans have the courage to fight, which some doubted, especially at home.
Europe leads 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a solid lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after beating the United States 10-6 in the four-ball and foursomes on Saturday.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a struggling Tiger Woods, giving them four points so far.
Determined to retain the title they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bjorn's European team made the difference by beating a disorderly American team 3-1 in the morning fourballs.
The United States showed greater resilience in the foursomes and won two, but they failed to close the gap.
Jim Furyk's men must score eight points out of 12 on Sunday in the singles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed Molliwood after a roaring weekend, are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in their first four games.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they beat the pair of American rookie Bryson Dechambeau and an already tired Woods by an even more decisive 5 and 4.
Woods, who was out for the two games on Saturday, has had a few good times, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-balls and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, well rested for the morning fourballs, teamed up with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, winning 2-1 over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, respectively world number one and number three.
Europe was not spared in the tournament, which took place in the southwest of Paris, in cool but clear weather.
Triple winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the American record by scoring two points on Saturday.
They won a well-deserved 2-1 victory over Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and again beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes, as they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team recovered from a four-point gap in singles, although Furyk's team, the defending champion, was now tied for the trophy.
After being runners-up for two days, however, they may not recover from a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says that disarmament cannot be done unilaterally without trust.
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations that the continued sanctions were reinforcing his distrust of the United States and that it would be impossible for his country to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
At the World Health Organisation's Annual General Assembly, Ri Yong Ho said that North Korea had taken important goodwill measures last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
 However, we see no corresponding response from the US , he regretted.
If we do not trust the United States, we will fear for our national security and under such circumstances we cannot be the first to unilaterally disarm.
While reiterating North Korea's well-known criticisms of Washington's opposition to a 'staged' approach to denuclearisation, whereby North Korea would be rewarded if it took steps gradually, its statement was important in that it did not reject the idea of unilateral denuclearisation as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump made on June 12 in Singapore during the first ever summit between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader, when Kim pledged to work towards denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula while Trump promised to ensure North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also rejected calls to ease severe international sanctions on North Korea.
The US insists that North Korea denuclearize first and increases pressure by imposing sanctions to achieve their goal in a coercive way, even opposing the "declaration of end of war".
Those who think these sanctions can make us fall don't know us.
The problem is that the continuation of sanctions increases our distrust. 
Ri made no comment on the second Kim-Trump summit highlighted at the UN by the US leader earlier this week.
The minister instead pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, adding:  If the party involved in the issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not be in such a stalemate. 
Still, Ri's tone of speech was radically different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korean missiles would inevitably be aimed at North American soil after the "evil" President Trump called Kim a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
Trump, who last year threatened at the UN to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim's courageous disarmament efforts this year, but added that much remains to be done and that sanctions would not be lifted until North Korea disarms.
On Wednesday, Trump said that no deadline had been set.  It could take two years, three years or five months; it doesn't matter , he said.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council last Thursday that:  The implementation of Security Council sanctions must be firmly and systematically maintained until complete, definitive and verified denuclearisation. 
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to curb funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then announced that he would travel to Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was somewhat disastrous.
In July, he left Pyongyang claiming that progress had been made but, in the hours that followed, North Korea denounced his  gangster methods .
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took equivalent measures.
According to the South Korean president, Kim is demanding Trump's security guarantees to Singapore and efforts to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard: Students take classes off
This year, Harvard University introduced a new course that allows all undergraduate students to get more sleep and counter the growing male dominance trend of studying while consuming caffeine all night.
A professor noted that most students at the world's best university don't know how to take care of themselves
The course, designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the first of its kind in the United States.
It was after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning that he got the idea.
And at the end, a student came up to me and said, "Why did I only get this last year?"
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me", he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first offered this year, teaches students the importance of good sleep habits to improve their academic and physical performance and general wellbeing.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The lesson time consists of different interactive exercises.
One section shows a picture of a dormitory containing various items (coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, books) which students click on to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, the impact of lack of sleep on their physical performance and the importance of integrating a routine before bedtime.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons then invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
 We know that this will not change students' behaviour instantly.
However, we believe they have a right to know this information - just as you have a right to know what the health effects of smoking are, added Professor Czeisler.
He says the culture of "sleepless night" pride still exists, and he adds that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students are making sleep deprivation a growing problem.
Getting enough and good quality sleep should be the secret weapon students use to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid gaining weight, because lack of sleep puts the brain in starvation mode, leaving them hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemistry and physical biology student from California, helped Professor Czeisler design this course after being one of his students last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He claimed that the course had opened his eyes and made him insist that it be offered throughout the campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to offer all postgraduate students a similar programme of study before joining the reputable institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students have an alarm set for both bedtime and wake-up time and be aware of the harmful effects of  blue light  emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which can disrupt their circadian rhythm and lead to sleep disturbances.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks Gerrard's men down
The Rangers suffered another hard blow on the outside as Dolly Menga's attack led Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
Ibrox's side were hoping to record their first away win since their 4-1 triumph in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side inflicted Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving his side adrift, eight points behind Ladbroke Premiership leaders Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes into halftime and the Rangers, running out of inspiration, failed to even the score.
As the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston moves up to third, just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And further difficulties could be felt for the Rangers, with referee Calum Spence having to be treated for a head injury from an object throw from the opposing side.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team, which swept Ayr in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, meanwhile, chose the same Livi 11 who took a point off the Hearts last week and would have been delighted to see his well-trained team suffocate his opponents in every round.
The Rangers may have had possession, but Livingston did more.
They should have scored two minutes into the game when Menga's first shot sent Scott Pittman into Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then fired a powerful shot at captain Craig Halkett, but his teammate defender Alan Lithgow could only reach the second pole.
The Rangers managed to take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have received a penalty after the free kick when he and Steven Lawless collided but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers had only two shots in the first period, but former Ibrox keeper Liam Kelly was barely disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly and a shot by Ovie Ejaria.
If Livi's opening goal in the 34th minute was against the game, no one can deny that they deserved it because of their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers have failed to get a shot off Jacobs's free kick.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher handed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool and chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard reacted at half-time by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the trade almost had an immediate impact when the winger came up to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed to block.
Livingston nevertheless continued to push visitors to play exactly the type of game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping long balls on long balls.
Holt's side could have taken the lead in the final moments, but McGregor did a good job of pushing Jacobs back before Lithgow missed the goal.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton again called for a late penalty as he was facing Jacobs, but Thomson again ignored him.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and THE COUNTER RUNNES... the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity; an invention that later gave rise to the device known as the Geiger meter.
A mainstay of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become fundamental in pop culture, as seen in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two unlikely scientists:
A man:  What is this ? 
Rogers: It's a Geiger counter, and we use it to look for radioactive minerals, like uranium.
With these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of atoms released in minerals by radioactivity. 
Evans: "Oh, come on, this is definitely going to blow!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains.
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to  detect  cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine enables the immune system to  detect  cancer cells and kill them
As part of the treatment, the vaccine tells the immune system how to recognize cancer cells
This technique involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in a laboratory.
They can then  detect  a protein that is common to many cancers, and then they are injected back into the cells.
An experimental vaccine is showing encouraging results in patients with different types of cancer.
One woman who received the vaccine, which is designed to teach the immune system to recognize cancer cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can detect the HER2 protein common to many cancers, and then injecting them back.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine".
According to Dr. Berzofsky, the HER2 protein  causes an increase in several types of cancer , including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancer.
A similar approach, which involves taking immune cells to  teach  them to target cancer cells, has been proven in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Wearing a MAGA hat, Kanye West has been engaged in a pro-Trump rant since joining SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed on set after a wild performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live and announced that he would run for president in 2020.
After his third song, Ghost Town, which he sang while wearing a Make America Great Again cap, West took a swing at the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
A lot of times I talk to white people and they say, "How can you like Trump? He's racist!"
 Well, if racism was my concern, I would have left America a long time ago, he claimed.
SNL started with a sketch by Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West's rant was shared on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
We don't know if Rock meant to make fun of West with this publication.
In addition, West had complained to the audience that he had spent a bad 15 minutes backstage because of his hat.
They put pressure on me.
They told me not to come with that hat on my head.
They put pressure on me!
And then they say I'm in a rut", he says, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on: "You want to see the abyss?" and said he would wear his Superman cape because no one can tell him what to do.
Try love.
His comments drew cheers from the audience at least twice and SNL members seemed embarrassed, Variety reports.  A deathly silence fell over the entire set. 
West was called in to replace last-minute singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West disarmed a lot of people by singing the song "I Love It" in a Perrier bottle suit.
West received support from TPUSA conservative leader Candace Turner, who tweeted:  To one of the bravest minds: THANK YOU for HELPING the crowd. 
But Karen Hunter, the host of the show, tweeted that West was simply "true to himself", and that's absolutely wonderful.
 However, I choose not to reward anyone (by buying their music, clothes or supporting their art) who I believe embraces and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so are we, she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and claimed that he was now officially known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion and of course the late legendary Prince, who changed his name to a symbol, then the artist formerly known as Prince.
Belfast: Attempted murder charged after knife attack at restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
According to police, the incident happened in Ballyhackamore.
The accused is due to appear in the Belfast Court of First Instance on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the prosecution.
Kit Harington, star of Game of Thrones, is taking on toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as the slim-blade Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, the HBO violent medieval fantasy series.
But the 31-year-old actor has taken on the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that this type of screen role often leads young boys to pose as tough guys to get respect.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he felt something was wrong and addressed the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, said he was "firmly" committed to tackling the issue.
I personally think deeply that we have abused masculinity.
 What lessons have we taught young men who are becoming adults about the problem now? 
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise in toxic masculinity because of its very masculine characters.
He continued:  What behavior is innate, what behavior has been instilled?
What are television and the streets teaching young boys that makes them think that they have to behave like that to be a man?
I think this is really one of the fundamental questions of our time -- how can we change this?
There's obviously something wrong.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not do any prologues or sequels when the series ended next summer, claiming he was done with the battlefields and the horses.
Starting in November, Kit will star in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that ever happened to him on Game of Thrones.
 I met my wife in this show, so she offered me my future family and my life from now on, he says.
Rose played Ygritte, the lover of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 in Scotland, at Leslie's family estate.
HIV / AIDS: China reports 14 percent increase in new cases
China reported a 14 percent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
According to Chinese health authorities, more than 820,000 people are affected.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the patients were infected during sexual intercourse, which is a new phenomenon.
Historically, the virus has spread rapidly in some parts of the country through transfusions of contaminated blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been virtually reduced to zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, year on year, the number of HIV-positive and AIDS-infected people in China has increased by 100,000.
In the Chinese LGBT community, HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is a serious problem.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70 to 90 percent of gay men eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission are due to inadequate sexual protection.
As part of its efforts to combat HIV, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines since 2003.
Maxine Waters denies that a GOP employee leaked data on senators, and denounces "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
On Saturday, US Republican Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her team had published personal information about three Republican senators on Wikipedia's lawmakers pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that these claims were backed by experts and websites  of the  far right .
 Lies, lies, and more infamous lies Waters responded in a statement on Twitter.
It appears the leaked information included the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information was posted online Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the Senate hearing on allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to the Hill, conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the messages was associated with Waters' office and leaked information from a member of Waters' staff.
According to Waters,  this unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie .
 The member of my team whose identity, personal information and security were compromised due to these fraudulent and false allegations is in no way responsible for the leak of this information 
 This false claim is completely false and a complete lie. 
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from Ari Fleischer, the former White House press secretary.
 This denial is anger , he wrote.
It indicates that she does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't get angry.
She must not be provocative.
She must not question the motives of the accuser.
She must remain calm and serene.
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters's reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, accused of appearing too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also shared his thoughts on Twitter.
 If it is true, it is huge , he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted  the relevant authorities and law enforcement  about these fraudulent claims.
 We will ensure that the culprits are exposed, she added,  and that they are held accountable for all their destructive and dangerous actions to all members of my team.
Johnny English has struck again, parody of Rowan Atkinson, under-paid spy.
It's now become a tradition to look at the scope of Brexit in any new British film and this seems to apply to this revival of the action comedy Johnny English, which debuted in 2003 with Johnny English and resurfaced in 2011 with Johnny English, The Return.
Will the ironic self-satire on the question of the obviousness of our insignificance represent the new export opportunity of our country?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his wide eyes and rubber face, was given a second renewal of his licence in a confused context - the name indicating first of all that it was a great comic creation designed for a non-English-speaking film audience.
Of course, he's the stupid secret agent who, despite his dubious attempts at glamorous charm, has a little Clouseau, a hint of Mr. Bean and a good dose of the guy who performs a small note in Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
Originally, it was also inspired by the international traveller and mystery man that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercials, leaving the chaos behind.
The last Johnny English has a nice moment or two.
I liked Johnny English approaching a helicopter while wearing medieval armor and the rotor blades hitting his helmet briefly.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is highlighted, although humor is rather inadequate and strangely superfluous, especially at a time when serious franchises like 007 and Mission Impossible are confidently composing themselves with comedy.
The humor seems more geared toward children than adults, and to me, Johnny English's wacky misadventures are less creative and less focused than Atkinson's silent film gags as Bean.
The ever-present premise is that Britain has serious problems.
A hacker has infiltrated the super-secret web of British spies, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, much to the chagrin of the agents on duty - a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the final straw for a pompous prime minister on the brink of crisis who is already suffering from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this quasi-Teresa-May character, but there is not much to be proud of in the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that every active spy has been compromised, and she must get someone out of retirement.
That means you have to bother Johnny English himself, who is now employed in a fancy establishment as a schoolteacher, but who secretly gives lessons on how to become a secret agent: some nice jokes here, because English offers a spy academy in the style of Rock Academy.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency intelligence meeting and finds Bough, his former long-time partner, once again camped out by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, attached to a submarine commander, a fun hockey stick role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit of a waste.
So Batman and Robin, who have been causing big trouble for Her Majesty's Secret Service, get back into action and meet Olga Kurylenko, the beautiful, fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls dangerously under the spell of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough launch their odyssey of wacky jokes: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a glittering French restaurant; they create chaos by sneaking onto Volta's luxury sailboat; and English sets off a veritable anarchy when he tries, with a virtual reality headset, to get acquainted with the interior of Volta's house.
All the stops are guaranteed for this last shot, but still, there's a lot for the kids in all this.
It's a rather moderate film.
I couldn't help but think, as with Johnny English's other films: can't the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that will really bring out his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it has come up with a plan to allow British people to work four days but get paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is due to consider a radical plan that will allow Britons to work four days a week - but be paid for five.
Apparently, the party wants business leaders to benefit workers from the savings generated by artificial intelligence (AI) by giving them an extra day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend, while still receiving the same salary.
According to some sources, the idea would be in line with the party's economic programme and plans to steer the country in favour of workers.
The shift to a four-day week was approved by the trade union congress as a way for workers to take advantage of economic changes.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times:  It is expected that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year. 
 This will not happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is a goal that goes hand in hand with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers as well as its overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea, as the Green Party was committed to a four-day workweek during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said:  A four-day workweek is not a policy of the party and is not envisaged by it. 
Acting Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to detail his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell has declared his determination to take power back from the  anonymous directors  and  profiteers  in public utilities.
The alternate chancellor's plans also provide that current shareholders of water companies may not recover their entire stake as the Labour government could make deductions because of alleged misconduct.
It also confirmed its plan to integrate workers into company boards and to set up an inclusive shareholder fund that will pay 10% of the capital of private companies to employees, who will pocket up to £500 in dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh might change their minds.
The final vote on Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination was delayed by at least a week following the FBI's investigation into the charges against him, and raises the question of whether the Bureau's findings could prompt Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired Sunday, Scott Pelley, the correspondent for 60 Minutes, asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course", said Kennedy.
When I went to the hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when these allegations were made, and I asked him, "Did you do that?"
He was resolute, determined, unequivocal.
However, Graham's vote seems etched in stone.
I've made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it would require an explosive indictment, he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett flatly denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And the people she names couldn't verify that.
This is a 36-year-old case.
I don't see anything new that changes.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a very impressive roster of stars and an equally impressive mission: ending global poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh year, will see tens of thousands of people flock to the Great Lawn in Central Park to not only enjoy the performances of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the festival's real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first held in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), spectators had to complete a series of tasks, or actions, such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, calling or making any other useful effort to raise awareness about poverty.
But how far can Global Citizen still achieve its goal in the remaining 12 years?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really persuade them to demand a call to action, or is it just another example of clicktivism - a situation where people really think they're making a difference by signing a petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded over 19 million  shares  from its supporters, who advocate for many different causes.
According to the organisation, these actions have helped to inspire world leaders to commit and adopt policies worth over US$37 billion that are expected to change the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements arising from its shares, of which at least a tranche of $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have so far directly impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the key commitments is The Power of Nutrition, a UK partnership of investors and implementers who have committed to  helping children reach their full potential , while pledging £35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in that country after receiving more than 4,700 messages from Global Citizens.
 With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history, Tracey Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition programme told the crowd at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that following the undertaking of more than 5,000 actions to call on the UK to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government has announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children through nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on its website,  what makes you think that it is possible to end extreme poverty? ,
Global Citizen said:  The road to get there will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and we will fail.
However, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will perform this year in New York, where Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will host the show.
The United States could use the Navy to create a blockade to block Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
In order to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, Washington can, if necessary, use the US Navy, US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke said, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russia's presence in Syria - particularly where it operates at the request of the legitimate government - is a pretext for it to explore new energy markets.
I believe they are in the Middle East to negotiate energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern centre of Europe, he said.
The official representative said there are ways to remedy this.
 The United States can, with our Navy, ensure that sea lanes are open and, if necessary, blockade them to ensure that their energy is not put on the market, he added.
Zinke was addressing attendees at an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organisation that describes itself as the voice of energy consumers in the US.
He compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, stressing that they were in fact identical.
 As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic option is more or less to exploit and replace fuels, he said, while referring to Russia as having  more than a rope around its neck with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come as the Trump administration has pledged to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to pull out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says is making Berlin "a prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double the current capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
In a speech in Moscow in September following a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said: "I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers".
The US position drew negative reactions from Germany, which reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The main German industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the US not to get involved in European energy policy or the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
 I have a huge problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply , said Dieter Kempf, the head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider running for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would seriously consider running for president following the midterm elections.
At a public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running.
 It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and for that, a woman will have to be at the top , she says, according to The Hill.
 After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president. 
Warren said what she thought of President Donald Trump at the public rally, saying he was leading this country in the wrong direction.
 I am very worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy , she said.
Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said:  Obviously we need an FBI investigation before we vote. 
However, a poll released Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's voters do not believe she should run in 2020.
According to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center and the Boston Globe, 58 percent of Massachusetts' likely voters said the senator should not run.
32 percent were in favour of such a campaign.
The poll found former Governor Deval Patrick to be more popular, with 38% in favor of a potential campaign and 48% against.
Other high-profile Democratic names being considered for a potential 2020 campaign include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make a formal decision by January.
Sarah Palin speaks about PTSD from Track Palin during Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being drafted in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged in connection with a domestic violence incident.
"What my own son is feeling right now, what he's feeling coming home, I can relate to other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers come back with", she told the audience at the rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her arrest a "taboo subject" and said of her son and other veterans that they come back a little different, hardened, wondering if you respect what their comrades and members of the Air Force, and every other military member, have given to the country.
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, he was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, which interferes with a report of domestic violence and possession of a firearm while intoxicated.
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia are in favor of a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, representatives from 18 states and the District filed a brief in favor of an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the complainant in the August case of Grace v. Sessions by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy was not released.
She said that her partner and sons, who were members of violent gangs, had assaulted her, but the US authorities decided to reject her asylum application on July 20.
She was held in Texas.
Prosecutors from states supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications to the United States, as countries facing widespread problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Council on Immigration Appeals, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, the District of Columbia Attorney General, said in a statement Friday that the new policy  ignores decades of state, federal and international law .
 Federal law stipulates that all asylum applications must be examined on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a ban violates this principle , the amicus curiae stated in his submission.
The lawyers also argued in the submission that the policy of refusing immigrants entry is harmful to the US economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and  provide the necessary work .
Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
 Asylum is granted to people who leave their home countries because of persecution or fear on the grounds of race, creed, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political belief,  Sessions said in his policy announcement on 11 June.
 Asylum was never designed to alleviate all the problems - even the most serious ones - that people face every day around the world. 
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation is getting more and more dramatic.
 I feel very tense , said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, comforting her feverish little boy in Palu, an evacuation centre in the emptied city.
 Every second, an ambulance is bringing bodies back.
Clean water is scarce.
Residents were seen going to their destroyed homes, picking up soaked goods and trying to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5-magnitude quake were flooded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken back and shoulders, were resting outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to persistent severe aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he related how he felt the powerful earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he lived with his wife and daughter.
We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was crushed in the ruins of the wall, I think", Haris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but after silence.
I don't know what happened to her or my child.
I hope they're safe.
US Ambassador accuses China of intimidation through propaganda ads
A week after a Chinese official newspaper ran a four-page ad in an American newspaper touting the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the surcharge paid by China Daily in the Des Moines Register - Iowa's best-selling newspaper  after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 US parliamentary election, an accusation China denies.
By accusing Beijing of trying to interfere in the US election, Trump marked what US officials told Reuters was a new phase in a growing campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently paralyzed in a growing trade war that has led them to apply reciprocal tariffs on their imports.
At the start of the trade war, China's tariff measures were aimed at hitting exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad writes in an op-ed in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, is doubling down on its intimidation by publishing propaganda in our own free press.
 In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the American tradition of free speech and freedom of the press by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register, Branstad writes.
 On the other hand, at the press box in Beijing, you will find few protesting voices and not see the true reflection of the divergent opinions that Chinese may have about China's troubling economic trajectory, because the media firmly obey the Chinese Communist Party, he writes.
He added that  one of China's most important newspapers avoided publishing  his article, without saying which newspaper.
Analysts warn Republicans are alienating voters as the midterm elections approach because of Kavanaugh's debacle.
While many senior Republicans are defending Brett Kavanaugh, who was appointed to the Supreme Court amid sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned that a backlash, especially among women, could come during the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiment surrounding this case has been extremely strong, and most Republicans have already publicly shown that they want the vote to happen.
In an article published on September 29 in The Hill, Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, said that there is no going back.
Reeher added that he doubted that last-minute efforts by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) to get an FBI investigation would be enough to calm voter anger.
Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, said, "Women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget tomorrow, not in November", she said on September 28, according to the Washington Post.
On Friday morning, Mic reports, protesters chanted "November is coming!" in the Senate corridor as the Republicans governing the Judiciary Committee chose to advance Kavanaugh's nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
 Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be overwhelming, said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst.
People say it's already high, it's true.
But it could be even higher, especially among women voters in the suburbs and among young voters aged 18 to 29 who, even if they don't like the president, often don't vote. 
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing the sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that the backlash could be intense if the Republicans pushed for confirmation.
According to NBC News, former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said earlier last week that it's become a confusing mess for the GOP.
 It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or the nomination of Kavanaugh.  It's also about how the Republicans handled the situation and how they handled it,  Guy Cecil, director of U.S. Priorities, a group that helps elected Democrats, told the television news.
However, following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, Americans seem divided over the credibility of both sides, with a small majority leaning toward the latter.
A new YouGov poll found that 41 percent of respondents believed Ford's testimony absolutely or probably, while 35 percent said they believed Kavanaugh absolutely or probably.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh probably or absolutely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FBI is investigating allegations made by Ford and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, after pressure from Senator Flake.
Ford testified under oath last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was assaulted by Kavanaugh while he was drunk at age 17.
Ramirez claims that when they were both students at Yale in the 1980s, the Supreme Court nominee showed him his genitals at a party.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a brand new company that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The tech legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that leverages Berners-Lee's free Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who is allowed to access this or that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly said that Inrupt aimed to "dominate the world".
We have to do it now, he said about the launch.
This is a historic moment.
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own personal online data store or DPL.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available at the same time in one browser.
The unique feature of the online personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access what type of information.
The company calls this  personal responsibility through data .
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company should provide the right resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, a few contracted developers working on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not yet in discussions with Facebook and Google about whether or not to make a complete change where all their business models are completely upended in an instant.
We don't ask them for permission.
In an article published on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee writes that the mission of [Inrupt] is to provide commercial power and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid.
In 1994, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Although he started Inrupt, Berners-Lee would remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
 I am extremely optimistic about this new era of the web, Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of a World War I clergyman awarded the Victoria Cross
The only Church of England clergyman to receive the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a fighter was commemorated in his home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann won this distinction on 29 September 1918, during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later, unaware that he had been awarded Britain's highest military honour.
His two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, last Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" to unveil the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather's feat.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion on the St Quentin Canal through very thick fog and under heavy field and machine gun fire.
Later, he rushed into the line of fire and, with the greatest bravery, led the line before blowing up a field gun all by himself and knocking out three soldiers from the detachment.
On October 4, 1918, a German sniper killed Lieutenant Colonel Vann, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were  something I'll never be able to match, but it makes me humble .
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt  very honoured to be part of the parade  and added that  the courage of a true hero is reflected in the support he will receive from many people .
Mixed martial arts fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206.
Imagine that, you spent the whole night watching a crowded Bellator 206, but you couldn't see the main event.
In San José, the event featured 13 fights, six of which were on the main card, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to face off, UK viewers were stunned when the broadcast changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unhappy with staying up until the early hours of the morning, especially for the battle.
One Twitter fan described the switch to children's cartoons as  a kind of bad joke.
On the broadcast, Bellator Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communications Dave Schwartz said that  government regulations state that at 6am, this content was not suitable, so they had to switch to children's shows.
"Peppa the pig", yes.
Scott Coker, the president of Bellator, said they would work on their programming to include UK viewers in the future.
 I think when I think about rebroadcasting, I think we can probably come up with a solution, Coker said.
 However, it is six o'clock on a Sunday morning and we will not be able to find a solution until Sunday our time, or Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program switched, there were a lot of messages going back and forth and not all of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't a problem, it was a government issue.
I can guarantee you that won't happen next time.
We're going to limit ourselves to five fights instead of six - as we usually do - and we tried to give more to the fans and we blew it.
This is a regrettable situation.
Tom Daley felt inferior sexually .
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he was in high school that not everyone was like me.
On the first show of Radio 4's Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give others  hope .
He also said that becoming a parent had made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The regular host of the show, Kirsty Young, took several months off due to her illness.
Appearing as a castaway on the first Laverne show, Daley confided that he felt less than all other children growing up because it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls.
He said:  Even today, those feelings of inferiority and difference are the real things that gave me the power and strength I needed to succeed. 
So as not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned the truth about his sexuality, he wanted to prove he was  something , he continued.
The double Olympic bronze medalist is now a prominent LGBT activist and used his participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke up because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said he never expected to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, 20 years her senior, but he said age difference had never been an issue.
 When you experience so much at such a young age  - he competed in his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he confidently says it is hard to find a person of his age who has had the same ups and downs.
In June, they became parents to a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that  his entire perspective  had changed.
"If you asked me last year, all I thought about was winning a gold medal", he says.
You know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
Her son shares the same name as her father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked him was if they already had their tickets to London 2012 as he wanted to sit in the front row.
I couldn't tell him: "Dad, you won't be here to be in the front row", he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it took him to stop breathing and die before I finally recognized that he was not invincible", he added.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
 It was everything I'd dreamed of all my life - diving in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, there's nothing better , he said.
In addition, it inspired her first song choice - Proud of Heather Small - which accompanied her during the preparations for the Olympics and always gave her the goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
A Mickelson out of shape on the Ryder Cup bench on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a new record Sunday in his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he'll have to recover to avoid an unfortunate setback.
Mickelson, who was competing in the biannual competition for the 12th time, a record, was disqualified by captain Jim Furyk from Saturday's four-ball and foursomes.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he has so often been for the United States, the five-time Grand Champion has split his day between supporting and tweaking his game at the booth in an effort to heal his wounds.
He was never the greatest of leaders, even at the peak of his career, and at 48 he is not the best suited for the difficult Golf National, where the long rough systematically punishes misses.
And as if the course itself wasn't formidable enough, Mickelson, in Sunday's ninth game, faces British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up this week with Tommy Fleetwood to win their four matches.
If the Americans, four down in the first 12 singles games, get off to a good start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his man, but he couldn't say much else.
 He fully understood the role he had to play today, slapped me on the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow, Furyk said.
He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a legendary champion and he's added so much to these teams in the past, just like this week.
I probably didn't see him play two games.
I didn't plan for more, but that's how it happened and that's how we felt we had to proceed.
He wants to be there, like everyone else.
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played.
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never quite reached the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has brought concrete elements to the team.
He's funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to make fun of people, and he's a great guy to have in the team room", he explained.
I think the younger players had fun competing against him this week, which was fun to watch.
He does more than play.
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the lead may soon be gone
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable lead before the singles on the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a painful course.
The Dane played his first match in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but eventually rose to the top of the standings with the smallest possible gap at the finish line, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep remembering that we were far ahead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we failed, and at Valderrama, where we won, but by a narrow margin", Bjorn said, after watching the 2018 Rankings win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday at Golf National to lead 10-6.
History will prove to me and everyone on this team that this is not the end.
Go all out tomorrow.
Go out there and do whatever you have to do.
It's not over until we get the points on the board.
We have one goal, which is to try to win this trophy, and that's what we have to stay focused on.
I've always said to focus on the 12 players in our camp, but we're very aware of what's going on on the other side - they're the best players in the world.
Pleased with his players' performance on a challenging golf course, Bjorn added:  I would never go further on this.
Tomorrow, it's a whole new set of sleeves.
Tomorrow, the individual performances will be presented and it's a very different story.
It's great to be with a teammate when things are going well, but when you're out there alone, you're tested to the limit of your full ability as a golfer.
That's the message to the players, to bring out the best in you tomorrow.
When you leave your partner behind, he has to go get the best out of himself, too.
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will seek to ensure that his players perform better individually than as teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself experienced both ends of the final day's turnaround, having been part of the winning team in Brooklyn before losing the  Miracle of Medina , where Europe snapped the victory.
 I remember every word , he explains in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had rallied his players on the final day.
We have 12 big meetings tomorrow, but you'd like to take this quick start like you saw in Brooklyn, like you saw in Medina.
This dynamic, when one-way, puts a lot of pressure on the midfield.
We set up our training accordingly and put the guys in as we thought we should, we try to do some magic tomorrow. 
Thomas was given the task of leading the counterattack and will face Rory McIlroy in the first-class duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the top half of the standings.
"I accompanied this group of guys in that order because I think it covers the whole course", Bjorn said of his singles selections.
Germany's new warship is delayed again
According to local media, the new German Navy frigate was scheduled to be commissioned in 2014 to replace aging Cold War warships, but it will not be in service until at least next year due to faulty systems and exponential spending.
According to Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman, the commissioning of the  Rheinland-Pfalz , the flagship of Baden-Württemberg's new frigates, has been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but troubling problems after delivery compromised the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
They will certainly have a powerful gun, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and some stealth technologies, such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the newest frigates for up to two years outside the port of call.
According to Die Zeit, however, the continuing delays mean that the forward-thinking warships - which should allow Germany to project its strength overseas - will already be obsolete when they are put into service.
Last year, the damned F125 frigate made headlines when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
The reasons for this return were not well known, but German media mentioned a number of  software and hardware flaws that made the warship unusable in case of deployment on a combat mission.
The software flaws were particularly significant as the Baden-Württemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of approximately 120 sailors, which is half the crew of the old Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it appears that the ship is considerably overloaded, which decreases its performance and reduces the Navy's ability to make future improvements.
It is estimated that the 7,000-ton  Rheinland-Pfalz  weighed twice as much as the similar class of ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the failures of the IT system, the cost of the project as a whole - including the training of the crew - also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached the astronomical sum of 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars), compared with 2.2 billion initially.
The problems with the new frigates are of particular importance in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval strength is declining.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged earlier this year that the navy is in fact  running out of ships capable of deployment .
The official said the situation had produced a snowball effect over time as the old ships were decommissioned but no replacement ships were designated.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust watches the secret life of bats
New research in a field in the Scottish Highlands is seeking to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the observations will shed new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and guide future conservation efforts.
The study by researchers from the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano bats as well as long-eared brown and Daubenton bats in Inverewe Garden, Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using handheld sensors.
A professional sound analysis will determine the frequency of the bats' cries and the activities of the different species.
A map and habitat report will be drawn up to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour across the territory.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser for the NTS, hopes the results will reveal the most important areas of habitat for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the creation of grasslands and how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, bat populations have declined dramatically over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects the perch and leads to the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also be a risk, as can fly-killing papers and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by pets.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, their nocturnal hunting habits make their ears more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to spot insects and obstacles in their flight path.
Responsible for protecting more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, the NTS takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts who regularly conduct drilling, inspections at the berth and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation also established Scotland's first and only bat reserve at the Threave site in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, the manager of the park, says that the site is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Threave, we have a perfect place for bats", he says.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the right living space.
But there's still a lot to learn about bats, so the work we're doing here and elsewhere will help us better understand what bats need to thrive. 
He stresses the importance of checking for bats before maintaining the property, as unintentionally destroying a single maternity nest can cause the death of 400 females and young or even the disappearance of an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb, or destroy their nesting sites.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scotland's head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said:  We still have a lot to learn about our bats and as for many of our species, we don't know what's going on in their populations yet. 
Ronaldo denies rape allegations as his lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape charges against him  false information , and claimed that people  want to be known  using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus striker was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He then reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported last Friday.
Addressing his 142 million fans in a video posted live on Instagram, hours after the allegations were made public, Ronaldo, 33, called the news "false information".
No, no, no, no, and no.
What they said today is false information, said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner to the camera.
They want to advertise themselves using my name.
It's only natural.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is fine, the player added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they described as "unacceptable disclosure of suspicions in the area of privacy".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for the  non-pecuniary damage  of an amount commensurate with the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious human rights violations in recent years .
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga apparently returned to the player's bedroom, where an anal rape allegedly occurred, according to documents filed with the Clark County Courthouse in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo got down on his knees after the alleged incident and assured him he was a "good guy" at 99% but that he didn't know what was going on with the remaining 1%.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claimed that she had turned herself in to police and that photos of her injuries had been taken in a hospital, but that she had subsequently accepted a plea bargain because she felt "terrified of reprisals" and feared "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to overturn the regulation as she remains traumatised by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault, and this summer he joined Italian giant Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: The UK would regret forever the departure of the carmakers.
According to Greg Clark, the Secretary of State for Trade, the UK would regret it forever if it lost its status as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston plant near Derby if Britain left the EU without a deal.
"We need an agreement", Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker has said that the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis vehicles - produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
 I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our plant, said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's head of Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears of leaving the EU without an agreement on how crossborder trade works.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month following Brexit.
The biggest concerns are what carmakers describe as supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run in  strained flow , parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU for custom-built vehicles.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, there could be disruption at the border which the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and so production would be halted.
According to Clark, Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is  precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls .
We want the best deal that will, as I said, not only take advantage of the current success but also take advantage of this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The obvious, not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers, is that we absolutely need to be able to maintain what has turned out to be an excellent set of supply chains.
While Toyota was unable to say for how long production would be stopped, it did warn that in the longer term, the additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, the union coordinator for Unite at the plant who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years, said his members were growing concerned:  In my experience, once these jobs disappear, they never come back. 
A government spokesman said:  We have proposed a clear and credible plan for our future relations with the EU. 
The White House says the Trump-Rosenstein meeting could be delayed yet again.
According to an announcement Sunday from the White House, the high-stakes meeting between Donald Trump and Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "postponed" by a week, as the fight for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump's associates and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether or not Trump will fire the assistant attorney general, and thus jeopardize Mueller's independence, has been fueling rumours in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had talked about wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president by the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein has denied these claims.
However, last Monday, he appeared at the White House, just as he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump has indicated that he would prefer not to fire Mr. Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the complaints against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
On Sunday, Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders made an appearance on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said:  No date has been set for this, it could be this week, I could see if it's pushed back another week given all the other things going on at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I like to keep the press informed.
The claim would be disputed by some journalists: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders responded that the rarity of the lectures was not due to an aversion to demagogic television reporters, although she did say: I have nothing against them stunning the gallery.
Then she hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
Without citing any evidence, she added that  the President attends more question and answer sessions than any other President before him :  We have checked the figures. 
Press conferences will always be held, Sanders said, but  if the press gets a chance to directly question the president of the United States, it's infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do this frequently, as you've seen over the past few weeks, and it's going to take the place of a press conference where you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends public hearings or press conferences with dignitaries.
He rarely gives a solo press conference there.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, by making a casual and at times bizarre appearance in front of the assembled press.
On Brexit fears, Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland
The Health Secretary has written to EU officials working in the Scottish NHS to express the country's gratitude and wishes them to remain in their posts after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to covering the cost of applying for status for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter:  During the summer, negotiations on withdrawal continued between the UK and the EU and should result in decisions this autumn.
But the UK government has also stepped up preparations in the event of a no-deal.
I understand this must be a very troubling time for each of you.
This is why I wanted to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each staff member, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring in valuable experience and skills that consolidate and improve the work of health services, and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay here.
After suffering a head injury, Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery
According to Mike Organ of Tennessee State, Tennessee Tigers quarterback Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Rod Reed, Tennessee State's head coach, told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the sideline and collapsed there", Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him for another check-up.
A Tennessee state representative told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operating room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris said there was no information yet on the type or extent of the injury and that the state of Tennessee was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore athlete, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five total tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his season total to 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty if they buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty if they buy property in the UK and the extra money will be used to help the homeless under the new Conservative regimes
This measure will undo the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty rate if they buy property in the UK - the extra money will go to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
This will be seen as an attempt to offset the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters by committing to providing more affordable housing and targeting high-income earners.
The increased stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay UK taxes, and the extra money will be used to strengthen the government's efforts to help the homeless.
This surcharge - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and rental purchases - could reach 3%.
The Treasury expects the project to raise up to £120 million a year.
About 13% of new housing in London is bought by non-UK residents, which drives up prices and prevents first-time buyers from entering the housing market.
Many wealthy areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost towns" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in stamp duty to help more young people buy their first home.
Accusing large construction companies of keeping house prices high by grabbing land without using it, he called on Mrs May to give up quotas on affordable housing in order to address the UK's housing disgrace.
Mr Corbyn has put forward an attractive set of proposals for housing reform, including rent control and the abolition of evictions  without fault .
It also wants to give councils more powers to build new housing.
Mrs May said:  Last year, I said that I would devote my post as Prime Minister to reviving the British dream - that each new generation would have a better life.
To do that, we need to fix our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and build a life here.
It is unfair, however, that it is as easy for non-UK individuals, as well as foreign companies, to buy a house as it is for hardworking UK residents.
For too many people, the dream of home ownership has become remote and the misery of the homeless remains too real. 
Jack Ross: My ultimate ambition is to run Scotland.
Sunderland coach Jack Ross explains that his  ultimate ambition  is to become Scotland manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is delighted to take on the challenge of reviving the North East club, who are currently third in League One, three points behind the leader.
He joined the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
 I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was selected for Division B and that's it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But I grew up watching Scotland's games in Hampden with my father and that's something I've never forgotten.
But that opportunity would only come if I succeeded in managing the club. 
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland coaches include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach says he has not hesitated to stand behind such iconic names at such a big club, having already turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
 For me, the success of the moment will be measured by the question  Can I bring this club back to the Premier League? 
He added that the structure and infrastructure of the club make it undoubtedly a Premier League club.
It's not easy to do, but I'd probably consider myself a success here if I could get the club back there.
Ross has only three years of coaching experience, after a spell as assistant at Dumbarton and 15 months on the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa to promotion from relegation to the Third Division and turned St Mirren, who were on the verge of relegation, into championship winners the following season.
Ross is more comfortable now than he was during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
The takeover of Alloa was a real crossroads, he recalls.
I really thought coaching suited me better than playing.
It seems strange because I was doing well, I was earning a good living and I enjoyed some notable peaks.
But sometimes playing is hard.
There's a lot of details to sort out every week.
I'm still experiencing that in terms of stress and strain at work, but coaching is fine with me.
I've always wanted to direct, and now I do, I feel more comfortable in my own skin than I've ever been in my entire adult life.
You can watch the full interview on Sportsound on Sunday 30 September on Radio Scotland between 12 and 1pm BST.
According to one survey, the ideal time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturdays.
The summer heat wave has boosted the revenues of struggling British pubs, but has added to the pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures show that bars and pub groups recorded a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin of consultancy CGA, which compiled the data, said:  The constant sunshine and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant that July followed the pattern of June, when bars had risen by 2.8%, except for restaurants, which suffered an even bigger shock.
The 1.8% decline in June in the catering sector only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars serving alcoholic beverages are by far the most popular, with more similarities than restaurants.
Food advertisements have also suffered from the effects of the sun, but not as much as restaurant owners.
It seems like people just want to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars, sales of drinks increased by 6.6% over the month and food decreased by 3%. 
Paul Newman, leisure and hospitality analyst at RSM, said:  These results follow the trend seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors in terms of sales in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that catering groups continue to struggle, although a decline in sales of 4.8% on average per annum is particularly painful, in addition to continued cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have been less favourable for food business operators and time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide a well-deserved respite. 
The overall increase in pub and restaurant sales, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in occupancy.
Industry sales are monitored by the Coffer Peach Tracker for the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector, which collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups, with combined turnover of over £9 billion and is the established industry standard.
On social media, one in five children has secret accounts that they hide from their parents
According to one survey, one in five children - some as young as 11 - has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students found an increase in fake Insta pages
The news has raised concerns about the posting of sexual content
20% of pupils reported having a main account to show their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - open a social media account that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in fake Insta accounts - a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about the posting of sexual content.
20% of students reported that they had a main account that was cleaned up to show their parents, but they also had a private account.
A mother who stumbled onto her 13-year-old daughter's secret website discovered a teenager who was urging others to  rape me .
According to a study by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of 11-18 year olds have a double profile, with half of pupils admitting to having private accounts.
CSM chief Mike Buchanan said:  It is worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online places where parents and teachers cannot find them. 
Eilidh Doyle will represent the athletes on the Scottish Athletics Board.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete in athletics and President Ian Beattie described the election as an excellent opportunity for the sport's leadership to draw on her extensive experience gained internationally over the past decade.
 Eilidh is highly respected in the Scottish, UK and global athletics community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland would benefit immensely from her participation in the council, said Beattie.
Doyle said:  I really want to be the voice of athletes and I hope I can really make my contribution and guide this sport in Scotland. 
The American, who won the 1996 200m and 400m events at the Atlanta Olympics where he won four gold medals and is now a regular commentator on the BBC, was unable to walk after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted:  A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors said that only time would tell if or how well I would recover.
It was a tough job, but I've fully recovered, I've learned to walk again, and today I'm doing agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!
An online ad for a breast pump comparing cows to mothers is dividing opinion
An online advertisement by a company offering a breast pump compares nursing mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of what has been described as the world's first silent breast pump, Elvie, a consumer technology company, launched a bold music video-inspired ad to show the freedom its new breast pump offers to nursing women.
In a cow barn full of hay, four real mothers dance to the rhythm of a song with the lyrics:  Yes, I chew myself, but you don't see a tail  and  In case you haven't noticed, it's my breasts, not breasts. 
The chorus goes on:  Pump it, pump it, I feed the babies, pump it, pump it, pump it, I help the women who are milking. 
However, the ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked an online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the public, many of whom say it sheds light on the horrors of the dairy industry.
 A worse decision than using cows to promote this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken away from them within days of their birth", one of them wrote.
The Elvie breast pump fits discreetly in a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented:  It is understandable trauma for the mother and the baby.
But yeah, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for moms who are keeping their baby?
Someone else added:  Such a disconnected ad. 
Others defended the advertising, for example one woman admitting that she found the song  hilarious .
I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The commercial is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a great product, someone wrote.
Another commented:  It's a funny ad for mothers who pump their milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like  cows .
This is not an advertisement that praises the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they danced with the discreet pull-ups hidden in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use the breast pump say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, without wires or pipes and fits discreetly into a breast-feeding bra, giving women the freedom to move around, hold their baby and even go outside while sucking.
Ana Balarin, partner and DPE at Mother commented:  The Elvie breast pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between breastfeeding mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight the challenges of breastfeeding, while also expressing in a fun and reliable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new breastfeeding system will bring.
This isn't the first time Elvie's breast pump has made the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the runway of designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have quietly settled in a camp on the Texas border.
The number of detained migrant children has increased sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively stable, partly because the Trump administration's tough rhetoric and policies have made it harder for respondents to place children with them.
Traditionally, most respondents were themselves undocumented immigrants and feared that they would jeopardise their own ability to stay in the country by rescuing a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that prospective respondents and adult members of their households would be required to submit their fingerprints and that this data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified last week before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for unaccompanied minor sponsorship.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
 Nearly 80% of the people who are respondents or their family members are here illegally, and many of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to prosecute these people, said Mr Albence.
According to the shelter's staff, in order to process the children's cases more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous norm.
Many of them will appear via videoconference, rather than in person, to argue their case regarding their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those found ineligible will be deported quickly.
According to the speakers and reports presented in recent months by the shelter network, the longer children are detained, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to outbursts of violence or attempts to escape.
In a large school like Tornillo, these concerns are exacerbated by the fact that signs of a child's distress are more likely to be overlooked because of their size, according to child rights advocates.
They added that moving children to the camp without giving them time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could exacerbate a trauma that many find difficult to deal with.
Syria is calling on the US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in that country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they  [would] be dealt with accordingly .
They must leave immediately and without condition, he told the assembly.
Moualem argued that the war on terrorism is almost over in Syria, with more than 360,000 people killed since 2011 and millions more uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to  wage this holy battle  until all Syrian territory is purged  of both terrorist groups and of any  illegal foreign presence .
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, most of whom train and advise both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in this war-torn country.
Moualem said that conditions were favorable for refugees to return, and accused  some Western countries  of  spreading irrational concerns  that discouraged refugees from returning.
 We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to ensure that these returns are facilitated, he said.
 They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue. 
The United States and the European Union have made it clear that there will be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition is reached to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last rebel stronghold of Idlib has helped move political negotiations forward.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented a large-scale assault on the province of three million people by Russian-backed Syrian forces.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement provided for  specific deadlines  and expressed hope that military measures would target jihadists, especially Nusra Front fighters, who are linked to Al Qaeda and  will be eliminated .
Staffan de Mistura, the UN representative, hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee bringing together members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution and prepare the way for elections in Syria.
Moualem set out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the group's work should be limited  to revising the articles of the current constitution, and warned against any interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump would be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers may hope, the impeachment and scandal lead him to leave his presidency prematurely.
Which would be arguably the most spectacular finale of a presidency !
At this moment, the audience shows no sign of fatigue.
Since 2014, peak hour ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN, and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers in prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's  Rachel Maddow Show , which reaches 3.5 million viewers on prime time, is the number one cable television network.
"It's a case that attracts people because it's not something we understand", said Neal Baer, host of the ABC drama series Designated Survivor, which tells the story of a minister who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a seasoned comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And Some Irrefutable Truths About Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys Club", has another theory.
She remembers taking a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked him.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh", Mrs. Scovell said.
Chaos has a playful value.
Of course, unlike anything that happens on television, the scenarios in Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the wealthiest viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself watching a panel of experts debate for six hours how Bob Woodward used a deep know-how for his book Fear, on Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather jacket (a garment filled with pride according to the Washington Post) and the consequences of Stormy Daniels' extravagant descriptions of, uh, Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I'll never see Super Mario the same way again.
If some of what he does feels like a reality show, it's because he makes you swallow something every night, said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about Trump's changing teams and daily ups and downs (fighting with the NFL, congratulating Kim Jong-un).
We can't afford to miss an episode or we're behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees at his home on the North Shore of Kauai, but he was locked inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't get away, not with Brett Kavanaugh preparing to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
I remember when we were running all these crazy shows and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.

Foreign money floods the tightest midterm elections
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th district is awash in cash, thanks to a congressional redistricting that allowed two incumbents to race for the same seat.
This recently restructured Pittsburgh suburb district is the seat of Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is competing with another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district has sparked a clash over campaign finance between the major party funders, the Congressional Committee for the Democratic Campaign (CCCD) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (CNCR).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory last March in a highly popular special election in Pennsylvania 's 18th Congressional District .
This seat had been held by a Republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political scientists have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The US considered penalizing El Salvador for its support for China, then backed down
The diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, to which Washington had little objection.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization's management.
State Department officials decided to convene the heads of the US diplomatic missions in El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama to protest their recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions were only imposed on El Salvador, which received an estimated US$140 million in US aid in 2017, including for drug control and development and economic support.
The sanctions envisaged, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and homicide rates.
While internal meetings continued, representatives from North and Central America delayed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a breakthrough in efforts to prevent immigrants from traveling to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, ending any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now speaking at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, to show the administration's importance to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American envoys have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without further messages or harsh punishments from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton at the White House declined to comment on details of the debate, which were described by the three US dignitaries, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations on condition of anonymity.
Their comments were corroborated by an independent analyst close to the administration, who also remained anonymous.
Studying the history
The next tiles could be special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice.
Mr. Mueller would also direct his investigation to the question of whether Mr. Trump's campaign colluded with Russia in its attack on our election.
If control of Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will be held accountable to that body as he prepares to run for office before voters and, perhaps, a jury of his peers.
There are many  if , and I am not suggesting that the fall of Mr. Trump is inevitable - or that of his European counterparts.
We all have decisions to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the potential duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were about to stage a coup against Hitler, if only the West had stood up to him and pushed back the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these divisions and the inevitable march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
Americans are currently facing a number of these divisions.
What will we do if Mr. Trump sends back Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a tight spot since the paper reported that last year he offered to secretly record the president and speculate about his unfitness to hold office.
Mr. Rosenstein claims the Times report is inaccurate.
 What will we say if the FBI's recent request for an investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or impartial - or if he is brought to the Supreme Court despite sexual assault charges and dishonest testimony?
And most of all, are we going to vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail to pass these tests, democracy will go through a long winter.
But I am convinced that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz under the Nazi regime, which had once occupied my ambassador's residence.
She survived, immigrated to America, and sixty years later, sent me to light some Sabbath candles on the swastika table.
With this legacy in the family, I cannot help but be optimistic about our future.

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, confident against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, although they know that the victory over the Austrians, following the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a solid position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury kept midfielder Graham Dorrans out of his first game of the season until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he is convinced that the Rangers are able to make the most of such a result to achieve feats.
 It was a positive point for us, because Villarreal is a quality team , commented the 31-year-old striker.
We went into the game thinking we were going to get something and we came out with a point.
We might have won in the end, but, on the whole, a draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came back in the second half and we were the better team.
Thursday is another important European evening.
With a little luck, we can hope to get three points, but it will be a tough game because they did a good result in their last game, however I am sure we can continue and get a positive result with the crowd behind us.
Last year was really tough, between my injuries and the changes that have been made to the club as such, but there's a satisfaction factor about this place now.
The team is good and the guys are having a lot of fun; the training is quality.
Let's hope we can move on now, leave last season behind and triumph.
Women are not sleeping because of this fear of their retirement savings
Although the respondents to this survey were clear about how they wanted to be cared for, few people discussed this with their family members.
Almost half of the people who took part in the national survey said they discussed the cost of longterm care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said they had told their children about it.
 People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't do enough to have that conversation, said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Tell your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not communicate your wishes well in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to determine where and how you can receive care, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial adviser: Your adviser can also help you to find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your decisions about financing longterm care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with a redemption value to help you cover these costs or another property insurance - provided you have the means to insure it.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles along the way.
Provide a healthcare proxy that will allow you to appoint a trusted person to check your medical care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Consider also a power of attorney for your financial resources.
You would choose a person you trust to make financial decisions for you and to see that your bills are paid if you become disabled.
Think about the small details: Suppose your elderly relative has a medical emergency and goes to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down these details in a document so that you are well prepared.
 It is not only the finances that are at stake, but also who are the doctors?, asked Martin.
 What are the medicines?
Who 's gonna take care of the dog ?
Put this plan in place.
A man was shot multiple times with a C.E.G. in Ilfracombe.

Police described the incident, which occurred at around 2.30am BST, as a "random act".
The victim didn't see her attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and police have called witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, and the toll is expected to rise.
Communications were paralyzed, and emergency services were unable to receive any information from Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated following the disaster.
Some key facts about Palu and Donggala on Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that stretches over 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The population of the regency, an administrative region located below a province, was estimated at 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy in Central Sulawesi Province, and particularly in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly located in Morowali on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last century, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck west of Donggala in 1996, killing nine.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly shaken by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh on 26 December triggered a tsunami that swept across 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: Several violent earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra from late March to early April.
A few hundred people died on Nias Island off Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hits southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake shook the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake devastated one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, and triggered a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake shook the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, reminding residents of the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was caused this time, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsing buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed several thousand buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, violating a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a statement released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance who was trying to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is being held in pre-trial detention at the Mat-Su Pre-trial Detention Center and is being held on an unsecured $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, pleading  not guilty, that's for sure  when asked to make a plea, the network reported.
Palin is facing three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report this alleged assault.
The case is pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence crime report and possession of a firearm while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior to PTSD stemming from his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake: several hundred dead
At least 384 people died as a result of the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and telecommunications networks are down and the toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck just off the central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Videos on social media show the impact.
Several hundred people were gathering for a beach festival in the town of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are calling for a rare death sentence for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the alleged New York assailant who killed eight people - a rare sentence that has not been carried out in that state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a truck rented from Home Depot to attack a bike path on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, cutting off pedestrians and a cyclist on his road last October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will need to provide evidence that Saipov  intentionally  murdered the eight victims and  intentionally  inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intent seeking the death penalty filed with the Southern District of New York.
Both charges are punishable by death, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury convicted Saipov of 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for extortion, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of violent crimes and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required  careful preparation and premeditation , prosecutors said, calling Saipov's method "hateful, cruel and depraved".
 Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco , the statement of intent said.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The Southern District of New York had not sought the death penalty in a lawsuit in ten years.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug dealers but was later sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was used in a federal case in New York was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed for conspiracy and spying for the USSR during the two years following the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, originally from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the tragedy, according to court documents.
According to police, he told investigators he was happy with his actions.
Saipov told authorities he was prompted to carry out the attack after watching Daesh videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to have the Daesh flag displayed in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "obviously disappointed" with the decision to prosecute.
 We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept his guilty plea and sentence him to life in prison without the possibility of parole can only prolong the trauma of these events for all concerned,  Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had already asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to mobilise the People's Army at a protest at the Conservative Conference.
The former UK Independence Party said politicians should feel the pressure from Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's MPs suggested, he should be in charge of negotiating with the EU.
Backbencher Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham march that the UK  would have been liberated already  if Mr Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But the dilemma that Mrs May faces in reconciling her deeply divided troops was highlighted by the Remain Conservatives who joined a lone anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain his Chequers compromise plan despite threats from those who want to leave and those who want to stay and from the EU.
The Allies stressed that she would continue her attempts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the hostilities - and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her programme and  chaos .
Mr Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to get rid of Chequers.
He felt that Mr Farage should have become a partner and be entrusted with the negotiating role with Brussels.
If he was in charge, we would have left already, he said.
The member for Wellingborough added:  I will support Brexit, but we must get rid of Chequers. 
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he continued:  We did not engage in world wars to submit.
We wish to make our own legislation in our own homeland. 
Mr Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote:  The idea that the British people have turned the page and want to stay is completely false. 
Conservative Andrea Jenkyns, who was in favour of leaving, was also present at the march to tell reporters:  I simply say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chess is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, and so is our party and our activists who are running through the streets and getting us elected first.
Give up chess and start listening.
In a message to Mrs May, she added: 'Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises. 
 Farage told the rally that politicians should be made to "feel the pressure" if they are about to betray the decision that was made in the 2016 referendum.
 It is now a question of trust between us - the people - and our political class, he said.
They're trying to cheat Brexit and we're telling them today: We're not going to let you get away with it.
He added in a message to the enthusiastic crowd:  I hope you will make our political class feel the pressure that is about to betray Brexit.
We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that has allowed us to win Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, self-reliant and proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, pro-European supporters marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists waved Conservative banners against Brexit after the group launched this weekend.
His Labour counterpart Lord Adonis mocked the Tories over security issues regarding party enforcement at the start of the conference.
 They are the ones who assure us that they are able to put in place the IT systems and all the technology for Canada, plus, for the frictionless border, for borderless free trade in Ireland  he added.
This is a joke.
A good Brexit does not exist, he added.
Warren intends to seriously consider running for president.
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat discussed her future Saturday at a public rally in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a vocal critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, a GOP state representative who served as co-chairman in 2016 for Trump's Massachusetts campaign.
She has been at the center of speculation that she might face Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters at a public rally since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she intended to run for the presidency.
Warren responded that it was time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, which means having a woman as head of state.
Arrest in the shooting death of Louisiana State University Sims.
On Saturday, Baton Rouge, Louisiana police announced that a suspect has been arrested in connection with the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department was involved in the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11:00 a.m.
On Friday, they posted a video of the shooting, asking for help identifying a man who appeared in the images.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed Friday morning near the Southern University campus.
 Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died from his injuries, Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told 247 Sports on Saturday.
Wayde defended his friend and was shot by Simpson.
When questioned, Simpson admitted to being at the scene, having a gun, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-2 who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games, including 10 starts last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton heads for world title after team guidelines allowed him to win against Sebastian Vettel
It quickly became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton last Saturday that the Mercedes team's instructions would play a big part in the race.
From pole position, Bottas made a good start and brushed Hamilton on the flank as he defended his place in the first two laps, inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered the pits first and left Hamilton to take on the turmoil at the back of the pack, which should have been a decisive factor.
Mercedes came through the pits a lap later and found themselves behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after a wheel-to-wheel action that saw the Ferrari reluctantly leave the interior at the risk of resisting after a double defensive attempt in Turn 3.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the grid and was seventh at the end of the very first lap to celebrate his 21st birthday.
He then dominated much of the race while maintaining his tyres to aim for a quick finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen in fourth place.
He finally made it into the pits on lap 44, but was unable to pick up pace on the remaining eight laps, with Raikkonen finishing fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team did an exceptional job to get a one-two", Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language.
At a rally last Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein, who pointed out that she had not released Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but he did argue that events unfolding in the Senate showed that people were  mean, disgusting and dishonest .
 The only thing that could happen and the good thing that's happening in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and disgusting and dishonest , he said.
When they see the leaks and the leaks, they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it".
Do you remember ?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak any information?
Remember his answer... did you leak information - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, I'm not going to.
I didn't say anything".
Well, wait a minute.
Did we release information... No, we did not release information", he added, thinking of the senator's impression.
Feinstein received the letter from Ford last July detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh, and the leak took place in early September, but Feinstein denied the leak came from his office.
"I did not cover up Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not divulge his story", Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
She told me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential like she asked.
But his denial didn't seem to go down well with the chairman, who commented on Saturday night at the rally:  I'll tell you, it was very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own ends.
 They are determined to take back power by any means necessary.
You see the wickedness, the meanness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control", the president told Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants , and the first round of the playoffs .
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars have wiped out their Elite League defeat to the Belfast Giants by winning the replay 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants opened the scoring with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the game at home before Dwyer gave the Giants back the lead.
François Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals, ensuring the victory.
It was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's players, who beat Dundee 2-1 on Friday night in Belfast after being caught up.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning their final three games.
Dwyer gave the lead in the fourth minute, 3:35, thanks to a pass from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford served Beauvillier who doubled the shot four minutes later.
In a busy first period, Sullivan re-engaged the home team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt went to Cownie's service at 15:16, with a tie.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the first half when he scored his second goal of the night late in the first period.
The home team rallied and Bouchard once again tied with a goal giving them a numerical advantage at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen put Dundee in the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, securing the win for his side by scoring a fifth goal at half-time.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will host Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller died while helping hundreds of people on a plane escape the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being hailed as a hero after he died making sure a plane carrying hundreds of people could take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many more are missing after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi island last Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to ravage the area and large numbers of people are trapped under rubble in the town of Palu.
But despite the escape of his colleagues, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to give up his post in the violently shaken tower at Palu's Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He remained on site to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped from the control tower when he felt it collapse.
He died later in hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said this action could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia's ABC News.
We mobilized a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"Our hearts are broken to hear this", he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, with the country's disaster prevention agency saying access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong cities is restricted.
 The toll is expected to continue to worsen as many bodies are still under the rubble and many have not been rescued, said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to 20 feet high have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News:  Every minute, an ambulance brings back bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN:  The Indonesian Red Cross is running to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse.
Joko Widodo, the President of Indonesia, arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's military:  I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready? , CNN reported.
Indonesia was rocked earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini says now that a man is missing after a plane crashed in the lagoon.
The airline that operated the plane that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says one man is missing after all 47 passengers and crew members safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon, it has been unable to track down a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more specific information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said Saturday that six passengers were still in hospital, and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events remain uncertain.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon near the runway.
Witnesses believe the plane went off the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes reported that the plane had landed too low.
"It's a very good thing", says Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the others were able to slide into the water to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He claimed that the flight attendants panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The US Navy claimed that sailors working nearby on a dock improvement also participated in the rescue using a rubber boat to carry people to land before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none involving Air Niugini.
The analyst presents a timeline of the night the woman was burned alive.
Prosecutors adjourned their case Saturday for the trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone records to trace the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Rowlett said he had obtained location data from several cell phones that indicated Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers's house while he was claiming to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford appeared in court on Saturday and testified that he was out of town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that he was lying because my truck was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Phone records show they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that sometime after Chambers died, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life", Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its pleas on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be heard by a jury later in the day.
The High Breed: What is political hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative perception of the genre by infusing their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and social issues.
The band wants to reconnect with their roots and make political hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black woman?
New York nanny sues couple for firing her after racist text
A New York nanny sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message mistakenly sent by the mother complaining that she was  still a Black .
The couple denies being racist, and equates the lawsuit with  extortion .
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her dismay when she found in 2016 that Giselle Maurice, the new nanny, was black when she arrived for her first day of work.
 NOOOOOOOOOOOON ANOTHER BLACK , wrote Mrs Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Mrs. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing his blunder, Plasco-Flaxman dismissed Ms. Maurice, explaining that their former nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and was expecting a Filipino instead.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for a day's work, then sent home by Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for her dismissal and is demanding $350 a day for the six-month housework she was originally hired to do, but without a contract.
 I want to make them understand, look, we don't do this kind of thing , she told the Post on Friday, adding  I know it's discrimination .
The couple responded to the allegations of racism by saying it was reasonable to terminate Maurice's employment, fearing they would not be able to trust him after they had wronged him.
My wife sent him something she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists, Joel Plasco told the Post.
But would you trust your children to someone you were rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn ?
Let 's see !
Equating the trial to "extortion", Plasco claimed that his wife was only two months away from having a baby and was in a "very delicate situation".
Would you prosecute someone like that?
This is not a very pleasant thing to do", added the business banker.
While the case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion did not hesitate to denounce the couple on social media, blaming them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington's publishers were concerned readers might not identify with a talking bear, new letter reveals
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter:  It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it is published.
It's very funny, given what we know about Paddington's enormous success.
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the children's book inspired by a small teddy bear, would have remained optimistic about the rejection of his work.She added that the 60th anniversary of the books' publication had a "sweet-bitter" flavor after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a  very important member of our family , and adds that her father was very proud of her final success.
He was a quiet man, and he wasn't a pretentious man, she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who accomplishes something: you're proud of him, even if it's not really his own achievement.
I think he saw Paddington's success in that way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always credited Paddington himself. 
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried everything to save her life.
 Nad called regularly to explain how bad the situation was, we didn't expect her to get away with it, said Ms Ednan-Laperouse.
Then Nad called me to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication that the doctors had given him to keep his heart beating was slowly running out and out of his system.
She had died some time before and everything stopped.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold out.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Leperose, mourning her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, not caring about the ordeal she was going through.
"No one knew", she said.
I had my head down, and I cried all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this immense sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Grief-stricken women leave postcards to prevent suicides on bridges.
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide struggle to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted postcards on a bridge in Wales with inspirational messages and phone numbers for people to call for help.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he started suffering from depression and committed suicide at 18.
 I don't want any parent to feel what I'm forced to feel every day, she said.
Mrs Davis, 45, from Lydney, said her son was a promising leader with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said her smile would light up any room.
However, he quit his job before he died, as he was in a very dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs Davis said:  I am constantly worried that there is a drag effect. 
Mrs. Davis created the  cards to let people know that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't keep quiet - you have to talk.
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost her partner of 15 years, Mark, shortly after her mother died.
He didn't say he felt down or depressed or anything", she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in her attitude.
He was at his lowest on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their presents, he didn't have eye contact with them or anything. 
She said that his death was a huge trauma for them, but they have to get over it: it is heartbreaking for the family.
It's destroying us.
But we all have to go forward and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought if we could get something like what he was asking for - a limited in time, limited in scope investigation - we might be able to bring some unity", Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would "crumble" into a partisan deadlock.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6th, and if, as expected, the Republicans score poorly, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators, asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and met, through him, his wife Ashley, who was his personal secretary at the time.
What happens after the FBI presents its report ?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
We don't know yet if Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to split the vote and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
North Korea: number of defectors  falling  under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, said 1,127 desertions took place last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that the strengthening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in tariffs demanded by smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has made no public comment.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors will eventually be granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which lies between the two Koreas.
China treats deserters as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South - which are still technically at war - have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the previously pending denuclearisation negotiations.
This followed the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed, in broad terms, to work towards a denuclearised Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the lack of progress since then on US sanctions.
 If there is no trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances, we cannot be the first to carry out unilateral disarmament,  Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh hysterical and says he's unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi, the House Minority Leader, called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh hysterical and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't help but think that if a woman had behaved this way, they would have called her hysterical, Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional and at times almost screamed and choked as he talked about his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations about him a grotesque and coordinated assassination organized by liberals disappointed that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she felt Kavanaugh's testimony showed he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court, because he showed he was anti-Democratic.
I think he's discrediting himself with these statements and the way he's attacking the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi was hesitant when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats won a majority in the House.
If he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not only unfit to serve on the Supreme Court, but he's also unfit to serve on the court where he currently sits, Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi also added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
During his confirmation hearings, Mr. Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether certain Supreme Court decisions could be overturned.
 This is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, "Isn't this wonderful?", Pelosi said.
And women should use it.
It's a legitimate argument, months and years of wrath flowing through, and she can't get it out without crying.
 We cry when we are angry, Mrs Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think it's uncommon, do you?
I was helped tremendously by a woman who was a manager somewhere, who told me that she also cried when she got angry, but she developed a technique that allowed her to say to the person she was talking to, when she got angry and cried:
I'm pissed off.
And then she kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant.
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger, in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most memorable memories of my first job, in a male-dominated office, where I found myself crying with inexpressible rage, was being grabbed by the skin of my neck by an older woman - a cold manager who always had me a little scared - who dragged me up the stairs.
"Don't let them see you cry", she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're happy because they got you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, after Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard a ship called the Monkey Business and withdrew from the campaign, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, said there was no reason for her not to explore the idea of running for president herself.
 It was not a well-thought-out decision , she told me laughing 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates running, and the last thing they needed was one more person.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
As the campaign was well advanced, she was running behind on fundraising, and so vowed she would not participate unless she raised $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She learned that some of her supporters who usually gave $1,000 to men were only going to give her $250.
"Do they think I'm entitled to a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not be running an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by her emotions - gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism - that she felt dizzy.
 You would have thought I was having a nervous breakdown, Ms. Schroeder recalled about the press reaction to her.
You'd think Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they were going to write on my tombstone.
"She cried"?
How the US-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The initial salvos of the US-China trade war have been deafening, and although the battle is far from over, a disagreement between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by imposing taxes on key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest increase came this week with new tariffs on goods worth US$200 billion (£150 billion), taxing half of all goods from China that arrive in the US.
Each time, Beijing has retaliated in kind, most recently imposing tariffs of 5 to 10 percent on $60 billion of U.S. goods.
China has committed to matching the United States, and the world's second-largest economy is unlikely to falter anytime soon.
To back down from Washington is to yield to demands, but to publicly yield to the United States would be far too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
However, experts believe that if Beijing can play its role properly, the pressures of the US trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
 The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for an economic slowdown in either country is actually far more dangerous than observers previously acknowledged, Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia, told the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syria is  prepared  for refugee return, says Foreign Minister
Syria is ready to accept the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
 Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism, he said.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary repatriation of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that sponsored the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Golf National near Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six straight times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the title when Denmark's captain Thomas Bjorn's team crossed the 14.5 points mark to beat the United States.
American Phil Mickelson, who had been struggling for most of the tournament, sank his opening shot into the water on the par-3 16th hole, giving up his duel to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all of his rounds, becoming one of only four players to ever reach 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format, which was first played in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was eliminated 5-4 by the lowest ranked player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's best golfer, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Eight-time Ryder Cup veteran Sergio Garcia of Spain became the all-time European champion with a career total of 25.5 points.
I don't usually cry, but today it's stronger than me.
It was a busy year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
What matters is the team, and I am happy to have been able to help them", Garcia said after the European victory.
He passes the torch to compatriot John Ram who beat American golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in singles last Sunday.
"I feel incredible pride, beating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy", said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost his four matches in France and now holds a career Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
A surprising statistic for one of the greatest golfers of all time, who won 14 major titles, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled to find the fairways all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top-level golf for the duration of the tournament.
US captain Jim Furyk commented after a disappointing performance for his team:  I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we had a certain moment where we put pressure on Europe.
We gave up.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're gonna regroup, I'm gonna work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we're gonna move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
You have to bow.
We've been overtaken by the world.
Red tide info point: Decreased concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The most recent report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission indicates a general decrease in red tide concentrations in some areas of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the CPF, more irregular flowering conditions are reported in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - causing fears of decreasing concentrations.
The red tide covers about 130 miles (209 km) of coastline, from northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
We're finding islets about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but in fewer sites than last week.
The red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
Moderate concentrations in or off Pinellas County were reported last week, low to high concentrations off Hillsborough County, higher concentrations in Manatee County, higher concentrations in or off Sarasota County, medium concentrations in or off Charlotte County and low concentrations in or off Lee County, high concentrations on or off Collier County.
Respiratory irritation cases are still ongoing in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No respiratory irritation has been reported in northwest Florida in the past week.
