The Prague Stock Exchange finished with fewer points at the end of the day
After the morning's rapid fall, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
The transactions in ČEZ shares reached approximately half the value they have on a normal day.
The Prague Stock Exchange, at the start of Tuesday's trading, reacted immediately to the fall on Monday when it fell to about 6%.
This time the drop is due to the fall in stocks on Wall Street.
This is also the market reaction to the result of the vote in the American House of Representatives which refused to support the financial sector secretary's stabilization plan.
Shares fall in Asia
The Asian stock market experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although the index eventually eased some of its losses.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Exchange index throughout its financial day marked almost four percent, although it later eased its losses by reducing the decline by practically 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index that tracks the movements of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange fell 3.8 percent, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent but, in the end, the losses fell to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange according to the Index Secretary fell to 3.6 percent.
"The planned bailout actions in the US are uncertain and this is influencing the financial markets around the world", said Hong Kong Monetary Office Chief Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it alone determines its monetary policy, i.e. without dependence on the Central Bank of China.
Hong Kong's interest rates are at the same level as those in the United States.
US lawmakers should reconvene as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and pass a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens that the falls will be felt in other countries.
Bloodbath of American stocks
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected a plan to help the financial system that would require $700 billion (about $12 billion).
The lawmakers, in that way, ignored President George Bush's invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would solve the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, American stocks experienced a bloody dip and mainly the stock index picked up the biggest drop in over 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell to nearly seven percent, a drop in volume similar to the last recorded in 1987.
The index dropped before it was announced but as soon as it was shown that the assembly's proposal was not going forward, the index began to fall freely.
Congress retreats: US government can inject 700 billion dollars into the bank
The highest representatives of Congress and the government, President George W. Bush, agreed on a broad-based agreement to provide financial assistance to the American financial system.
The vote will take place early next week.
US lawmakers caused a rift in talks over the approval of the bailout plan in the form of a $700 billion (about 12 trillion kronor) bailout for the American financial system.
However, it is not yet won.
Congressmen must refine some details of the contract before they can make public the final form of the law and have it voted.
The plan to help the financial system will be discussed Monday in the House of Representatives.
Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services and Banking Committee, told Reuters on Sunday.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be held in the Senate no earlier than Wednesday.
According to economists, the arrival of the ratification of the bailout plan should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
But then there will be 'disillusionment' thanks to the complex mechanisms which will also be achieved in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great strides.
We resolve our divergent views on how the package of measures for market stabilization should be", said Democratic Nancy Pelosi to Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met Sunday night with the Minister of Finance, Henry Paulson, to give a definitive shape to the government fund.
It should buy from financial corporations the unsold mortgage assets which lead to heavy losses for financial corporations and threaten the stability of the whole system.
"We are about to conclude the agreement on the plan, which will work and must also be effective in the market.
It is still necessary to continue with the sanitation plan, but I think we are already on it", said Paulson.
A signal for Asian business
The global financial crisis is having a clear impact on the rapidly declining stock market.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are doing everything they can to get Congress to finally pass a deal this Sunday.
They want to reassure investors' business in the Asian financial market, which is in the first time zone and where Congress could influence Monday's trade.
However, at the moment it is not clear for sure when the two chambers of the US Congress will vote and even if they will not stall at the last moment with some problem.
The lawmakers believe it will be approved in the next few days.
The law, however, will undergo a series of changes.
The total amount intended to help the system should be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion must be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush requested.
However, Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it has the impression that the program is not fulfilling its function, which would be another $100 billion and, later, the last $350 billion.
Bush appreciated the progress of the meetings
On the other hand, the president can veto this decision but Congress can override his veto by a majority vote.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program was to earn financial resources to buy back bad mortgage bonds whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to finish paying their mortgages.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be ready to vote on the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday", Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
President Bush is also satisfied with the progress of the meetings.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush was satisfied with Saturday's progress and appreciated "the commitment on both sides to stabilize our financial market and protect our economy".
Limitation of the armored contract
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, said lawmakers decided on the responsibility of the money program for protecting taxpayers' taxes from their losses, a relief closure of the scheduled finance plan.
The new law should also limit so-called shielded contracts for directors of the participating companies in the programme, and create a committee that will have control of the Fund.
This one should be run by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it, and we have made great progress towards a deal that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans", Paulson said.
The plan also assists homeowners who have problems with their payments.
The government would have to agree to new mortgage payments to lower the monthly payment burden on borrowers and allow them to keep their homes.
Marek: psychological help
The proposed plan is, according to the chief economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea that will be implemented but quite difficult.
"And that is why it is not known with what mechanism and at what price the problem assets will be purchased.
This will be decisive for the distribution of losses between the financial sector and the government", Marek said this week, for the server iHNed.cz.
Whether the plan is approved now or early next week is not, according to Marek, that relevant.
"Much more important is that, this week, the congressmen agree on their support and give their approval as soon as possible.
This important and psychological agreement to reach that approval is, at this moment, the most important thing", Marek insisted.
Armed hand-to-hand combat: the MP3 player against the mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost every mobile plays MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls.
Which makes it seem clear that it's better to just buy the phone.
Yet there are sufficient reasons for man to acquire only the reproducer.
The choice depends almost entirely on the way it is used and the demands of the future owner.
It will probably be difficult for me to acquire the most modern turntable to listen to the latest Maxim Turbulenc album.
Moreover, such musical products as LP records are no longer available, and as far as their quality is concerned there is no objective reason to continue buying them.
If you have art rock, jazz, or blues vinyl records on your shelves, you are probably dreaming, at least, of this type of turntable.
This is the same with music that's on the way, that is, compressed music, simplified music -- MP3 music.
And here there are price and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, as for a Pink Floyd lover who will hardly try the merchandise helmets of twenty crowns.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for each.
The choice is wide.
It also decides the battery life
Some of the best players do a lot more than just play music and even that which even most mobile phones don't.
No other device today is as universal as the telephone.
In contrast to the most basic functions like calling, sending messages, it can play music and video, record both, have a better or worse camera and even navigate.
And when we consider the smartphone and the PDAs you're going to have in your pocket a little computer too.
This is a small miracle since no refrigerator can make a grill and no television can photograph.
The universality of mobile phones also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your phone, the earlier the indicator on the screen will light up, asking to be recharged.
And music playback is one of the biggest energy drains.
Few mobile phones can play music for more than ten or twelve hours, most much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest) are clearly more efficient.
So keep in mind that cheap phones won't play for more than two hours.
If in addition to this, on top of that, they constantly call for a charger for work - this is also true for the most expensive appliances.
With the MP3 player this problem will not have, because even the worst can withstand at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a charge.
Another problem occurs when recording music on the mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a small proportion of the devices have the universal USB connector and not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course it is possible to record music directly to the memory card but only some unreduced playback units can be connected to the small memory cards used in mobile phones.
In the case of players, with one exception (iPod), no special software is required.
Just fill the device with music through the computer's USB.
Most mobile phones and players create their own order in the music library according to the name of the performer, album title, genre or also according to the user rating.
Some devices only show a directory with a tree structure similar to a Windows Finder and some recognize both (river, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
The player tries to serve, the mobile knows more
When choosing a particular device, consider the battery's strength, the memory capacity, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of handling.
If you listen to music in the background and listen to it only once a day, like on the tram, then you can use any mobile phone that plays it.
Which practically gets any real mobile.
You should not even care about the format in which the mobile phone or the player plays the music.
MP3 is played by everyone, and practically all the music you get will be in this format.
It is among the most widespread and, with the exception of it, the absolute majority of the devices play music in WMA format.
The fewest include the AAC format (the format used by Apple and its iPod).
The best mobile phones also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
It is enough to visit the relevant websites of the operator (or any other service provider) and buy a song or an album via the mobile internet.
This service alone could be a strong argument for purchasing a mobile for music.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is poor and most of them are limited to the topics of short-lived radio success.
Prices aren't the lowest either.
However, in general, it is assumed that this very way of selling music (whether via GSM, internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry a mobile phone with them.
Whenever you feel like listening to something, you'll find your phone in your pocket, while your MP3 player will be left at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry headphones or, at least, handsfree ones.
If not, you can use an integrated player that virtually every mobile has, even if it's at least an MP3 player.
Probably the biggest advantage for many of the music phones will be their price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand.
Between three and four thousand crowns you can already buy a good walkman.
Most of you will be limited by the absence of a classic headphone ticket.
The best, even in terms of the technical part, such as phones equipped with a 3.5 mm input for classic headphones, cost up to fifteen thousand.
Again, the advantage of players is nothing but their easy service.
The simplest players - by no means necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - are actually handled by anyone.
The minimal functions, their handling similar to the previous ordinary cassettes or also to the turntables is evident.
It's not a threat in the sense that we accidentally connect to the internet with our mobile and, consequently, a huge data download bill.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for changing the memory card (M2 type, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of a proper card it will reach two thousand crowns.
Be careful, though.
Basic models are usually equipped with only a 2 GB card of maximum capacity.
Only the most expensive ones have 8 GB of memory.
If you already have a mobile and you want to buy a cheap MP3 player, check out Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
According to the capacity (maximum 2 GB), no more than 1.100 crowns need to be spent.
If you are considered among the most demanding music lovers, you can use the most specialized mobile walk-man (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent keys for the MP3 which makes a service as comfortable as that of a single player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose walkman line phones have almost identical use as a standalone MP3 player.
The same service and the same price category, over four thousand crowns, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery (usually 15 hours, with a maximum output of up to 35 hours), the brand mentioned above brings them MP3 players.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Probably
The mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer virtually all services as their Western European partners.
However, here we are still missing something - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
He'll probably be here any minute.
That Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe, we have already written on mobil.cz.
The Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ) also confirmed the rest, warning that the price of SMS messages in our country is among the most expensive in the whole Union.
After the latest steps by the European Commission in the field of roaming fee regulation, a paradoxical situation is likely to arise - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS sent from abroad will be cheaper than from home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there's no competition that really wants to fight.
This is probably paradoxical to us, because we have three mobile networks and their high coverage is over 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
The President of the Board of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ), Pavel Dvořák, has already said that there is no longer any place in the Czech Republic for any other operator.
It is perhaps true that for a traditional operator with its own network it no longer has too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be very difficult to find any frequency).
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator.
The entry of the virtual operator into the mobile telephony market led to a significant price decline, to which the traditional operators also had to react.
At the same time, even before sharks like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the British market, similar voices were heard both there and here.
It has been shown that there is room for such operators and that they can succeed.
Otherwise, we need not look too far for examples.
In February of this year we informed you about the premiere of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just six months, this operator managed to gain over 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighbouring country.
Mobilking is also the parent company of Penta, which also owns U:fon in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is that they can concentrate on many more specific target groups.
In addition, in order to operate effectively, they only need to have far fewer customers than a traditional operator.
They do not entail relatively large expenditure on network construction, operation and maintenance.
In the world, these types of virtual operators are usually characterised by low costs - they offer cheap calls and SMS messages which, however, are often countered by the offer of more tight services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Britain offers SMS at least half the price of the competition.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, betting on a trivial target group can also be a good hit.
This operator is specifically targeting the man.
"The right man chooses Mobilking - it's the operator he likes and can trust", says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which runs this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept as that of Poland could catch on in our country.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav Čepický doubts this: 'The Czech market is relatively small to access by segments on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, from the point of view of the supply of services, it is relatively saturated".
In the Czech Republic, there are no chances, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there is any virtual operator in the Czech Republic it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the Czech Republic. It does not seem too hopeful.
Rather, it is about the launch of Mobilking in other countries in our region", said Jana Studničková, spokeswoman for the financial group Penta, in a telephone conversation for mobil.cz.
He indirectly stated that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not inclined to this idea.
Rather, they try their best to prevent any potential competition from arising.
Interest in launching a virtual mobile operator is already shown by the GTS Novera group, which would like to take a step further to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of business customers.
"We are very interested in this, so that we can offer our customers not only fixed telephone services but also mobile telephone services.
And the sooner the better.
We have met with all Czech mobile operators on this occasion.
With some of them we have made progress in the meetings", said the group's spokesman, Pavel Kaidl.
Then maybe they're flashing better times.
It seems that, from unofficial information, the first official operator should arrive possibly by the end of the year.
But for now, his appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
'At the moment we believe that the situation is right for a virtual operator to appear on the Czech market.
The Czech market is a very specific market compared to others.
So far no one has approached us with any complex and serious project in this field", said Vlastimil Sršeň, spokesman for Telefónica O2.
Other operators are mentioned in the specificity of the Czech market.
T-mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová, in exceptional accordance with the O2 opinion, adds: 'To date we have not registered any viable commercial project that can be further developed with bilateral benefits.'
He adds: "On the T-Mobile network it will be difficult to find any virtual operator until the end of the year.
At this point we should have on the table some concrete contract that could be studied in such a short time horizon".
Vodafone is focusing instead on meeting the requirements of a 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepický adds: 'We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this is in terms of cost sharing and infrastructure.
We consider this to be the biggest contribution from the customer's point of view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this field is to establish a partner with whom to share a network for fast mobile internet.
Responsible offices - with the nail and meat operators
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increased competition, which would lead to lower prices and, with them, lower profits.
So why facilitate entry into the competition?
When operators want to get something, they are able to pull on the same string, proof of this is the grip when U:fon emerged.
Perhaps the greatest pressure on the ČTÚ was at the time of the entry of U:fon by the T-Mobile company.
This is borne out by the public information available on the ČTÚ website.
But now U:fon is the argument for why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová adds: 'In addition, the competitive environment in the mobile phone market was recently opened up to a fourth operator.
As regards the nature of the mobile telephony market in the Czech Republic, it is natural that the entry of another player into the market would entail high requirements for him and, above all, for his services.'
This is why this access to mobile operators is extremely discouraging because of the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory body.
This is not just the position of the CTU, which unfortunately has no competence to intervene in commercial tenders, unlike Great Britain and other developed countries.
This is purely the responsibility of the Office for the Protection of Commercial Tendering (ÚOHS).
However, it expressed its typical position on this problem.
'The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile telephony market would be possible after an agreement on the lease of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile telephony operator and a virtual operator is concluded.
No agreement has been concluded to date as the offer of potential interested parties was not sufficiently interesting for traditional operators", added Kristián Chalupa, from the Department of Foreign Affairs at the ÚOHS.
These statements do not surprise the representatives of the operators.
For the offices which are supposed to represent the interests of consumers, this is more than a consideration, apart from this they must see that no one takes advantage of their position in the market.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In the foreign countries where virtual operators operate normally we can see that their entry into the market contributed to the fall in prices of mobile phone services".
Obviously, pressure on the proper functioning of the market and price reduction are not in the interest of the ÚOHS.
What is really dramatically shocking about this whole case is the dissonant reactions that result from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether it is really a coincidence, it comes up by itself.
It is the same as the price of petrol at petrol stations, for it is clear that it is the work of chance and a hard fight for competition.
'The Office has not found any signs of unfair competition in this respect and therefore has no grounds for intervening in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position and therefore they do not have a corresponding increase in responsibility for their actions on the market.
The necessary tools to open the mobile phone market to virtual operators, rather, are lacking, as well as telecommunications regulators", added Chalupa.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many points of conflict.
There is of course an analysis of relevant markets by the ČTÚ which shows that telecommunications is a single market from the point of view of commercial tendering.
In this type of market, naturally, none of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - for a virtual operator to emerge, agreement with the network administrator is always necessary.
And the mobile phone operator - with all its logic - has a monopoly on its network.
It must therefore necessarily be dominant in a particular segment.
And if this argument is not accepted, at least for ÚOHS it should be a warning that three mobile operators are promoted in strikingly similar ways.
The current complaints from interested parties (including GTS Novera) show that in all negotiations with the operators they encounter many similar impediments.
The charge of responsibility on the ČTÚ is a common trick in the telecommunications field from which the ÚOHS washes its hands in this whole matter.
We've met him before in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, a new amendment to the Telecommunications Act to extend the competence of the ČTÚ in the field of commercial tenders was recently tabled, but it was not implemented, despite the promises of a number of experts that the situation would improve.
The representatives of the OHIM should know this, but their interests are clearly elsewhere.
Everything's fine when no one's looking
At the same time, a kind of pseudo-virtual operator is still operating unnoticed, and there are already a few of them in the Czech mobile networks.
They are companies that set their own prices for mobile telephony services, but only a part of them are public.
These are usually companies that are engaged in multi-level marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Normally only a select few get the price list from these companies.
The magic is that the company, in relation to the operator, acts as a classic business customer of the same ordering a large number of SIM cards.
As a special customer, you will receive special prices and other offers later.
The problem is that the commercial conditions at all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
"If cases like the one you mention were discovered, it could be a breach of the terms of the contract which could result in the end of the partnership with the company", Martina Kemrová said.
But it is quite unlikely that such activity by mobile phone operators would not reach responsible people.
In the case of the three companies mentioned above, it may be thousands of customers.
None of the operators is against this procedure.
They make a considerable profit from their activities and at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - do not threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns us of the potential problems: "the law allows such speculation, however, the services of this company are used only by a negligible percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card on their phone is not in their name and therefore cannot have it at their disposal as a normal customer of the carriers".
This is precisely what should seem to the CTU minimally strange.
A new question for the OHIM is also added.
If mobile phone operators are blindfolded in this kind of procedure, why block the virtual operator's entry?
It should be added that the ÚOHS has sufficient competence to detect such activities and if it does not wish to do so it should not be satisfied with the operators' explanations that they have no idea of this story and that their commercial conditions do not allow it.
When we stop being the most expensive
As already stated in the text, the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile telephony market led to a significant drop in the prices of the services.
At the same time, in virtually all countries where the virtual operator emerged, the traditional operators more or less tried to protect themselves from this breakthrough.
The arguments used by these were almost all identical - too small, a market, eventually, too saturated, problems with the quality of service, etc.
In the most advanced countries, however, the regulatory bodies have intervened and in none of the cases have they defended the operators but their customers.
Whether through formal measures or informal pressure, they managed to create the first virtual operator and with it, others began to emerge.
Unfortunately, the Czech Regulatory Authority is treating this whole case as if it were a burning nail.
We cannot but be impressed by our experience that confusion of powers in these cases suits them.
But let's not despair.
If this behind-the-scenes information is correct and the virtual operator actually reaches these lands, then the Czech mobile phone market will probably start moving again.
If one of the operators allows in a virtual mobile operator it will be difficult for the ÚOHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And we may stop calling more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to the four performances of the new version of the official Czech anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new official recording of the anthem Where is my home on the occasion of the official Czech celebrations.
The new anthem was recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - two solo versions, one with male and one female vocals, one with choir and one instrumental.
The singing is handled by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the arrangements of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
Bělohlávek considers this Czech national anthem to be one of the most beautiful.
Czech Radio has already said before that it intentionally chose for the Solos singers with representatively younger voices who are more expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I tried with both and then, also, with the Choir to fixate on the diction so that the text was well understood, so that it had consonance", he said.
The official Czech anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where, My Home was first played in 1834 on the boards of the State Theatre in the original Czech play Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl and arranged with music by František Škroup.
It gained popularity and people made it their own.
The first verse of the song after the emergence of Czechoslovakia in 1918 naturally became part of the official anthem.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "New" Anthem Sounded
Prague MHD takes us Wednesday for the first time with the chip
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, is written in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first passengers enter the subway, tram and bus with an electronic voucher in their pockets instead of a paper ticket.
This can be purchased at this moment by almost 100,000 people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase the 30-day, 90-day and annual voucher (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and simultaneously charge it to their chip card at the information centres and stations of the transport company at the Metro stations, Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The bonds can be purchased from yesterday on the internet on the pages of the transport company, www.dpp.cz.
The service, until the afternoon, was used by over four hundred people.
Those who start using the Internet as a form of commerce may start to forget about the ticket booths at subway stations, where they had to regularly queue up to get a normal ticket.
The voucher is purchased online, and the Opencard card is recharged at one of the thirteen branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places there is a window with prepared staff available to passengers to help interested parties with the purchase via the internet and also with the recharge of the voucher purchased on their card", said the project's spokesman, Martin Opatrný.
Apart from the library, it will also be possible to recharge the electronic voucher on the Opencard at the vending machines located in some lobbies of the metro.
What are these vending machines like?
They are red, reminiscent of a ticket machine, and travellers have probably already noticed them at the metro stations of Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are five in the city now but by the end of the year there should be eighty", Opatrný added.
The bond is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
The use of the machine, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
Simply insert the Opencard chip card into it and the previously paid voucher will be loaded onto it alone.
Electronic bonds are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in the surrounding area.
That is to say, in the ring trains and bus lines from the numbers 300 to 499 which are mainly used by the inhabitants of the localities of central Bohemia.
"In the trains assigned to the integrated transport of Prague there are reviewers equipped with a reading card that will help to confirm the validity of the time and the zone of the bonus", explained the control of the tickets, Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid that establishes the hours of collective transport of Prague.
The round-trip buses have their reading cards mounted on the driver's cab.
When entering, the driver must not only be shown the card but must also be accompanied by the Opencard at the designated place on the side of the Box.
The driver then controls the validity of the voucher.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the bonuses there is nothing easier than requesting this information from the driver", Drápal added.
Passengers who do not travel on the round-trip buses and do not remember when the voucher expires may go to the vending machines where the cards are recharged.
Here, on the machine screen, you will be shown the information about the validity of your document.
Southeasterners wanted to be part of the United States in a referendum.
The German Sudets asked in 1945 that Fumaba be part of the United States.
This is what is extracted from the letter which is kept in the collection of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to at least live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With this desire, presumably, some groups of Germans from the Sudetes addressed the president of the United States in 1945.
It is the result of letters kept in a private archive and now kept in the collection of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans of Český Krumlov request in a letter to the American president that he not allow the return of the "Sumava land" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Pact - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and we really want your word that American units are coming to German lands not as oppressors or enemies but as liberators", the letter reads, signed by a "people who carry the fate of Šumava in their hearts".
Since the union of Czechoslovakia with the southeastern Germans presumably implies - according to them the Czech national character - a hope only in brutality, recklessness, misunderstanding, pressure and slavery, the authors beg in the letter the American president to assume for now and forever Šumava under a protectorate.
"We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of four million inhabitants we are handed over to a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and that in no way collaborates with the victory of the allies", the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is presumably fear of reprisals from the "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States is presumably in doubt about this idea of the Šumav Germans, it would be enough to organize a referendum in the Šumav lands on whether its inhabitants want to be part of the United States or live under its patronage.
Although the letter's text, with our current knowledge of postwar history, may sound a bit childish, some experts say it paints a vivid picture of the expectations of the Germans of the southeast at the time.
Although the Czech Germans must have had a slight intuition that it was going to be about their expulsion from the republic, only a few admitted this possibility.
Some hoped that the United States and Britain would negotiate for the Sudetenland some clear form of autonomy.
Others thought they would stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed even by the Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
This one was in the war, as a Budějovice German, enlisted in the Baltic navy.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and placed in the Holstein prison camp, dozens of Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They thought that when they came home, the Czech would be useful", said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war, he said, counted on the Benes Decrees to keep them away from the Republic.
You don't think - you pay!
Emotional campaign attacks drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
This is how the Ministry of Transport decided to launch the emotional campaign in the media on Wednesday.
The office of the Minister, Aleš Řebíček, promises to dissuade drivers from dangerous driving behaviour.
The 150 million campaign will be heard on television, radio, cinema, internet and in brochures.
It would have to dissuade the driver from speeding and alcohol at the wheel.
And also to remind you to fasten your seat belts before you start.
It is intended to reach the consciousness of young drivers, motorists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what can we see in the ads?
Basically human stories that strike at the emotions.
And we can attest to this by the "bloody" ads throughout the campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The word "don't think" is written in big letters on the license plate.
And in a pool of blood is the word "pay".
This must symbolize that man in a moment of unconsciousness may come to pay with his own life.
The ads will "scare" viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign carried out in Anglo-Saxon lands where strong images of accident victims can be seen.
He promises that in this way he will reduce the number of accidents and fatalities on Czech roads.
The announcements have been prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and whips for drivers
"The system of sugar and whip is for drivers.
Sugar is for him when, for example, he turns a red light and saves time.
The whip is a threat of a fine or an accident.
Drivers should be reminded of the risks", says transport psychologist Martin Kořán of the hospital Na Homolce.
And that is why we need a press campaign and mainly negative publicity, specifically the psychologist.
Less effective, he says, are the signs that warn the driver of dangers.
"If there is a warning panel installed, it will probably soon merge with the environment and the driver will not pay much attention", Kořán warned.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied areas in exchange for peace
The President of the Israeli provisional government, Ehud Olmert, has announced the return of virtually all the lands occupied in 1967, namely the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He proposed in the interview that Monday appeared in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians which means that we will necessarily have to return almost all (occupied) land if not all", Olmert told the newspaper.
"We will certainly keep a certain percentage of these lands, but we must give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of Israel's lands) because without this there will be no peace", he added.
He admitted that in the case of restitution East Jerusalem would also be included.
"Whoever wants security in Jerusalem and therefore does not want tractors or excavators to go over their legs as happened to one of my best friends, then he will have to give up a part of Jerusalem", Olmert said in reference to the two July attacks in the city in which several people were killed and dozens were injured.
According to the president, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple hill, a sacred and historic place" that is located inside the ancient city.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This won't work", he insisted later.
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights
Olmert also called for Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he considered an inherent condition for concluding a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also require concrete efforts on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal of the Golan", he warned.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to give up to win the Golan.
They must abandon their current relations with Iran, they must abandon their relations with Hezbollah (the Chite movement), they must abandon the permanent support that terrorism from Hamas (the Chite movement), Al Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq provokes", the prime minister said.
Questions after the accident: Are flight attendants on buses illegal?
The law is unknown, you can't walk on a long-distance bus
In connection with the tragic accident of the Student Agency bus near the Italian city of Padua, the question arises whether the stewardesses and passengers can move on the bus during the journey.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of the stewardess is against the road traffic law", says the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The accident that killed the 22-year-old flight attendant last week was evidently caused by the driver of the truck only the bus crossed the road.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the least secure seat of the vehicle despite having two other seats reserved.
However, the bus may have an accident or stop suddenly, and at the very moment when the steward delivers the coffee or newspapers.
The question here is whether the bus is equipped, according to the technical permit, with foot seats.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must sit.
The long-distance buses of the Student Agency have no places to go standing, which was confirmed by the director of the company, Radim Jančura, to Aktuálně.cz.
"We have resolved this with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally, they removed it and we agreed that passengers can go to the bathroom while the bus is running if they have a seat", he told us.
The stewardess doesn't know the law
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the stewardess' role - no legal provision clarifies this function.
Even no legal provision prohibits transport agents from providing any service.
The road transport law only knows the term 'Vehicle Inspector', whose rights and obligations are not defined", adds Hanzelka, a spokesman for the company.
The director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, thinks, on the contrary, that the law adequately addresses this problem.
"Depends on whether the bus has the approval allowed for having foot seats.
That's all", he says.
Buses are divided into urban, where there are standing places and limited maximum speed, intercity with standing places with a higher speed permit and long-distance buses with no standing places, with the highest speed permit and with seatbelts.
Like on the plane, says the expert
BESIP's transport safety expert Jaroslav Hořín sees no major problems with the steward's movement on the bus.
"During the course of the journey there is not much danger, the situation can be compared to the service on airplanes.
Even here you can't be sure that the turbulence will come and the stewardess can get hit in the head".
"However, if the bus brakes suddenly evidently the laws of physics are valid.
Same as on a city bus or a tram.
The safety of the stewardess must be solved by the internal regulations of the transport operator", he says and also thinks that from the point of view of the law this problem is unresolved.
Jančura is prepared to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only carrier that offers the stewardess service.
He employs 200 people.
The director, even after the accident, considers that work risky.
"However, the moment I get the impression that the stewardess position is risky, then I will suppress it.
Coffee and newspapers can be received by passengers upon entry.
It would even save expenses", he says.
In the interest of safety is the reason why Asiana lacks stewardesses in its vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, who runs a small line compared to SA.
"We don't have stewardesses, we've been against them from the beginning.
Sooner or later this will end in a fatal accident", he told Týden.cz less than a year ago.
A great tragedy has occurred.
The accident on the Naples-Pilsen line killed a young airline stewardess who had worked for the company for two years.
A Slovenian truck that probably turned from the parking lane blocking the way to the bus.
His driver tried in a quick maneuver to avoid him, however, he crashed into the right front.
Jančura denies that the two places reserved for the hostess' rest were sold.
"These sites cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked".
The company intends to sue the truck driver.
The agency is not going to wait for the verdict of the trial on the compensation of the girl's family but expects the financial expenses also on the part of the guilty.
Reform the law?
No, for now.
The law reform could bring greater precision on the movement of the stewardess on the bus in which for a year now they are working thirty experts members of a group of the Ministry of Transport.
"However, they have not come to any concrete conclusion.
They do not focus too much on buses, but rather on the points system, maximum speed on the motorway and the use of the mobile phone during the march", says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of stewardesses as something that significantly threatens the safety of passengers", spokesman Hanzelka concluded, saying that the control of safety on buses is the responsibility of the police and the Office of Safety at Work.
The hope of Dusseldorf rests on Frankfurt
The letter from the board of directors of West LB Bank to its employees is full of big words.
The merger of the Dusseldorf bank's units with DEKA bank could create a central capital market for the Sparkassen financial group', as the letter published on Monday states.
West LB, breaking the 'competition block' with sustainable profit capacity would enter such a business.
In addition, such a merger may be a starting point for further mergers in the area of regional banks.
That is how the text is understood when a board of directors wants to show capacity to act in difficult times.
Because as before, West LB is under tremendous pressure.
Not only from the European Union, but also from the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority, which recently made it clear to the North Rhine-Westphalian government that there was little time left to find a solution.
For some time now, also on the Frankfurt side, there has been much talk of such a merger between DEKA, known to Sparkasse's clients for its investment funds, and West LB.
In fact, Franz Waas, the head of DEKA, presented the data after half a year at the end of August, saying that he saw no point in merging the bank, located on Mainzer Straße, with a regional bank such as Helaba or West LB.
But the DEKA board, which is now composed of the regional banks and Sparkassen associations, instructed the board to start negotiations with West LB on joint commercial activities.
This could be a business on the capital market or parts of it.
Of course, the negotiations have just begun, so the financial website says.
This is not the first time that the name of DEKA, which with its 3000 employees is one of the most important entrepreneurs on the Frankfurt financial site, has been mentioned in connection with the consolidation of Sparkassen.
At one point in 2003, the situation looked like this: DEKA could merge with the Rhineland-Palatinate regional bank and Helaba.
This initiative to create a three-party union was without results.
As soon as the plans were made public, the Hesse government expressed itself against Helaba's participation in this project.
The other two banks also didn't find the same language.
The Rhineland-Palatinate regional bank instead started a dialogue with the Baden-Württemberg regional bank.
But the idea of merging DEKA with other regional banks was always being played out.
But finally Günther Merl, the chairman of Helaba's board of directors, expressed his opposition to the coexistence plans with his bank.
The Commission is also aware of the need to ensure that the Community's financial interests are not undermined.
When the Bavarian parliamentary elections are due to take place, the merger of BayernLB with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg could make progress.
For the Helaba, that's not necessarily good news.
If the pressure to continue merging increases, Helaba will lack the partners to do that.
In the south the bank might be only a young partner, although so far it has stood out much better from the financial crisis than did the buildings in Stuttgart and Munich.
On the other hand, the Sparkassen- und Giroverband of Hesse-Türingen, which owns 85% of Helaba, at the beginning of the year avoided coexistence plans with West LB.
In any case, only Nord LB remains.
But such geostrategic reflections form only a part.
The second is the compatibility of the different banking models.
In June, Merl asked a fundamental question about a business model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, to which the German Sparkassen- und Giro-Verband has so far not given any answer.
In the end, West LB can be broken down, but that is not, of course, the bank's own wish.
The letter from the bank's board also says that an attempt will be made to find a complete solution for the whole bank.
How you can combine the coexistence of singular parts of the bank with the DEKA, that's going to show time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "the weekend of the Italians".
For Elena it's the first time, for Luca it's the third or fourth.
But this time, he's assisted by Elena as his girlfriend, and that's why everything seems different, he says.
Behind them, next to a five-litre keg of Kaiser brand beer is a huge tiger bear that shows nearly 200 Oktoberfest participants how low sounds it can make in its throat.
First Elena gives Luca a pat, then a kiss.
From Bologna they came to Verona.
From there, from the parking lot next to the Porta Nuova train station, three buses leave tonight at 23:45, heading for Munich, the beer party', expected to arrive at 6:30 in the morning.
Three buses are planned mainly for Italians, one bus is only for Brazilians.
In one of the corner of the parking lot next to their flag are South Americans singing, they had already started to party at night.
"Much noise", says Marco Guarda, "which is nothing for Italians".
Marco, who wears a long coat with a leather liner and silver-colored eyeglasses, owns these buses.
For five years they have been coming to Oktoberfest, considering that this year alone there are three trips.
Night on the road over there, day in the meadow, 10:30 back.
Spending the night there means only unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome reception with a Kaiser beer that was made according to the Bavarian purity law, health insurance and the guide in German- Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
At night the buses are already on the way on the highway with the address "Brennero"
No beer, not yet.
Soon the bus is quiet, the passengers are asleep.
It's all right, they'll still need the strength.
It stops at Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other Italian-registered buses make another stop on motorway 8 just before Munich.
Finally, when Marco's group has the scheduled arrival at 6.30 a.m. in the parking lot next to the Prado de Teresa, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others meet, Marco has his last speech on how to proceed.
First, put on a yellow cap.
There, on the left side it says "Oktoberfest", next to it in Gothic letters is Marco's travel office page on the internet: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When the doors of the campaign tent open, that means march!" cries Marco in the early hours.
"March!" March and take the back seats in the campaign tent.
"Don't take the front seats, because we're going to block, and all you yellow hats don't sit on the same bench, spread out all over the space!"
A liter of beer, Marco roars, is 8.25 euros.
Don't forget the tip
Show the security people we have a good tone!
As soon as he gets out of his seat, he'll be busy!"
Third: "Tonight at exactly 10:30 you have to be here!" Do you understand?
And now they're all going to Oktoberfest.
One, to mark the way, ties yellow hats to trees, traffic signs and even an election poster for a large Bavarian People's Party.
You wish you could recognize the way back.
It's the second weekend of Oktoberfest, which is known as "the weekend of the Italians".
There are no exact figures on the number of people; it's 50,000 people who make the journey over the Alps and tormentingly enter the tents, 10 percent of all came especially this weekend from Italy.
The Munich police are assisted by seven police officers from the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers help the Bavarian Red Cross which makes a statistic of the nations present, where the Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, ahead of the English (about 60 assistance) and the Austrians occupy the first place.
The favourite Italian country shop is called Hofbräuzelt.
The sleepless nights for the creditors of Hypo Real Estate
Germany's banking system is relatively stable, as the Federal Minister of Finance Peter Steinbrück stressed only last week.
That is good, that the politician used the word 'relatively' and added that the German banking sector will also be affected by the critical trends.
And that's after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), the Munich real estate financier listed on the DAX, receives a loan of 1 billion from a consortium of German banks to be able to withstand market turbulence.
On Monday, a person familiar with the situation told Reuters: credit aid amounted to 35 billion euros.
The portion of the capital that Hypo Real Estate is going to use has to yield interest.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
The cause of that is the losses of the subsidiary Depfa.
According to one report, the state financiers with the money that was lent for long-term projects financed them only for a short period - which now, because of distrust in the markets, is no longer possible.
In the first half of the year the cash bank capital reserve has fallen by 95 per cent, to 2.37 million euro, and the equity share has fallen slightly from 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent.
Compared with the same period last year, continuing financial investment income and net income from financial operations fell to zero, and imputation income for debtors and some securities and those from the winding up of provisions for credit operations declined by more than 70%, to EUR 5 million.
Only the high and high revenues from the reimbursements of the compensation costs of the restructuring of the former Depfa group as well as the interest reimbursement under the federal tax code and the business organised for the consortium companies could lead to a negative balance deficit of approximately 16%.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former state-owned bank was initially lost in speculation with industrial loans for real estate, which served as the reason for the founding of the Aareal bank.
As there was not much money to be made from financing State projects, Defa began to focus intensively on infrastructure projects and financing Community projects by private and State investors (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and diversified.
Now Hypo Real Estate has to make amortizations on the value of the subsidiary which will have an "essential material effect" on the consolidated account of losses and profits of the group, it is said very imprecise.
It's a fact that they've canceled the dividends.
By 2007 they were cancelled by two thirds.
After the acquisition of Depfa Hypo Real Estate became an important state and financial player in the field of infrastructure.
As the bank does not own customer deposits, it is more dependent on refinancing on the interbank market than other banks.
With the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers, which happened two weeks ago, the granting of interbank credit fell essentially because banks were saving their liquidity.
Every year Hypo Real Estate needs almost 50 billion euros to finance a part of Defa's credit portfolios of its short-term measures for refinancing.
According to the Hypo Real Estate report, the bank is providing a loan to cover the group's short-term financing needs and the company is assured of "the influence of international money markets which are now essentially unfit for business".
Other sources say that thanks to this money the refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, chairman of Hypo Real Estate, explained that Hypo Real Estate Group would not need money markets for the foreseeable time.
The German central bank and the Federal Financial Supervisory Institute (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now assured.
That's what the shareholders and creditors of the bank have to expect.
But because of the dynamics and the imponderability of the crisis there is no consistency.
It is even conceivable that the full volume of financing will not be needed.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out.
The word was that at the last hour of Sunday the bank was still almost insolvent, so temporary relief cannot reassure at least worried people.
The share price fell to 75 percent, 3.30 euros.
The loan courses, on the other hand, are really good.
While priority debts are almost unchanged, loan rates by position in the land register are clearly downward.
The loans of the former Württemberg Hypo subsidiary are particularly affected and, therefore, the loans whose maturities exceed 2009.
Following the significant growth of the banking crisis and the takeover of Depfa that affected Hypo Real Estate, the present value of its loans which were previously an investment for speculation must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as the issuing banks, governments and banks that are not affected are still ready to support the system, the pension depreciation can start within the time limit.
Or something is going to happen, which no one dares to imagine - the financial crisis will be over in the next 15 months.
But seeing the cross-news about partial statistical integration, now the security that is already at its limit became a justified hope.
That's going to be one reason, because the creditors will spend their nights up, busting their heads over the decision about their enthusiasm isolation.
Still short-term investors can put the end point and use the new account carryover of losses for future pay-off tax benefits on the change in the future.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bent-Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, a 16-year-old girl, had to present herself at Tachibana High School on her first day, the girls started laughing: "The German is totally kawaii!"
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word Mangas - in a report on the exchanges she tells of Japan.
"First day at school in Japan.
I was nervous.
Even before I went to school I was afraid.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in Kawasaki direction and I take a 40 minute train ride to Tachibana High School.
I had to find my way alone, luckily I didn't get lost.
It seems that the beginning of classes is not as rigorously fixed as at my home in Lower Saxony.
At eight in the morning the students come, at nine-twenty a small meeting with the teachers begins, the 'home room'.
Before the class started, I had to introduce myself.
I'm also not a person who likes to speak in public, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since they still have the school uniform, I put on an old skirt of my host family's mother and a blouse, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Well, dressed like this, I stood on the pulpit and tried to pronounce everything correctly: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana"... - my name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and in a week it will be my birthday.
At this moment I was very happy because I had already started to study this language two years ago.
All 31 girls in the class have been whispering, laughing and signaling and all the while I've been hearing the word "kawaii"
I knew her from my Mangas.
That's Japanese girl survival vocabulary and it means "honey, cute".
Then I quickly slipped into my seat.
The girl next door had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the exchange girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was pretty quiet, but when the gong went off, I felt really assaulted.
Everyone was talking at the same time, laughing and asking a lot of questions - at the same time it is very difficult to understand English from Japanese.
Then at recess, everyone took out their Bentos.
My host family's mother also made a Lanchbox for me - it's something other than boring German bread crumbs.
It had rice with herbs, little sausages, cucumber and seaweed salad, fruit and something like tofu meatloaf.
Most of the time I have no idea what I'm eating here in Japan.
Things are weird and they have a new flavor.
What's certain is that everything is very rich.
Well, maybe with the exception of plums marinated in salt, bufff!
In Japanese schools, bentos are not just a lunch.
Sometimes a girl prepares a very artistic bento for a boy and gives it to him in the hope of getting to know him better during a recreation.
I read about it in my Manga-Comics.
I'm very curious to see if I can see it here too.
"Why Japan?" my friends have asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to Tokyo for a year of school.
Then he would always say:
"Well, because I'm fascinated".
Finally, for years I've been reading Manga.
To better understand comics and culture, I started to study a little Japanese one day.
I was absolutely sure that one day I would travel there.
Also because I have a thing for tradition and customs.
They're very valuable here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, and on the other hand, it is a strict, disciplined and traditional country.
Since everything is so well organized, I still didn't feel lost here even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen in my life".
Rats have feelings too
They say that a rat or a cockroach senses danger and flees, why is it also afraid?
Joseph Le Doux, a neuroscientist, is convinced that many animals have feelings too.
How can you control whether they, behaving in a similar way to us, feel the same way?
An online magazine called "Edge" has been publishing contributions from famous scientists for many years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the chosen answers to the question What do you think is true without being able to prove it?
I think animals have sensations and other states of consciousness that I or anyone else could not prove until now, although we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, at least we can expect it because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
But as soon as we go into other species and include questions about sensation and consciousness in general, we enter the unknown because the hardware doesn't match.
When a rat is in danger, it does what other animals do: it pretends to be dead, flies or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from which some scientists draw conclusions about comparable subjective experience.
I don't think so, of course.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transmit our subjective experience to that of animals.
First, they almost always include the circuits associated with human consciousness in the lateral prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex (because of their involvement in short-term memory and executive functions that direct behavior).
This broad part is much more developed in humans than in other primates and seems to be lacking in other creatures.
Taking into account at least aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex, including knowledge about who we are and the ability to plan and make decisions, there is reason to suppose that even man is different from other primates.
Another peculiarity is found in man's linguistic nature: Since most of his experience is linked with language, it often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case animals may be excluded.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, it would influence it so that the consciousness of animals, created however, would in many cases differ from most of our states of consciousness.
That's why it's hard to explain how the consciousness of other animals works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, is not measurable because it has the special hardware, nor is it analyzed by our experiments, then their research presents us with big problems.
Most of my speeches concern the content of conscious experience, but at the same time there is also another aspect of consciousness that should be easier for scientific research.
You could study the consciousness processes of animals without considering their contents, and that's what happens during studies of primate short-term memory, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach that Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, the essence goes more to the neutral correlations of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: The two may or may not be similar.
Interestingly, this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex for the formation of visualization.
And what does that do for sensations?
I owe it to the fact that in the emotional system, a part of the brain is activated that is responsible for that, the same thing that happens with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a mental state we are in when brain activity occupies a space of the defense system (or its consequences such as body reactions).
From this point of view, sensations are very much fixed in part of the cortex, which distinguishes primates and especially man.
From the point of view of linguistic nature, subtle sensation classifications follow because we can differentiate and classify states with the help of words and grammar in order to be able to describe the states of others alongside ourselves.
For example, Antonio Damasco, on the other hand, thinks that sensations are derived from the simple activities of the parts of the cerebral cortex responsible for bodily feelings and the brainstem, Jaak Pankseep thinks the same, but he concentrates more on the brainstem.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can refer to absolutely different types and their sensations.
For theoretical reasons I cannot go against that, but I consider it unlikely.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel as fear, it possibly feels in two cases also like this: But how can you control if rats and men behaving in a similar way feel the same?
When a cockroach sees danger, it flees, because it's afraid?
I am of the opinion that similarity of behaviour does not yet prove similarity of experience.
That's true, and neuronal comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain trunks, whereas cockroaches don't have at least one brain.
Is the brainstem responsible for sensations?
Even if it is possible to test it for men, how can it be tested for rats?
I think rats and other mammals, possibly cockroaches too (who knows?), have senses.
But I don't know how you can prove it.
I prefer to investigate emotional behavior of rats than emotional sensations because their sensations are supposedly fundamentally different from us (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and language).
In any case, progress in the field of neurology is expected here, as both rats and men are measured.
Since I don't study the language and the consciousness of rats, as well as sensations, I don't know if they exist.
You can say I don't see beyond my nose, but I'd rather move on than work permanently without results.
Well, I'm a practical emotional writer.
UEFA President Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Iwan Wasjunik, the deputy prime minister said that the preparations would soon be carried out under the direct responsibility of the president and the prime minister.
"The government views the UEFA decision in Bordeaux as a test of confidence in Ukraine's ability to organise the European Championship together with Poland", Wasjunik said.
"But that's not an amnesty for our country.
Now the work is about to begin and there is much to do in both countries".
The timetable for the construction and reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in the host countries is stiff.
The number of stadiums will probably be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
Now we have to carry out works with great speed", said the president of an association Ukraine Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA won't take its eyes off us".
In Poland a more radical step was agreed.
After numerous scandals the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish association PZPN and replaced it with the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "a serious danger that the PZPN is not able to follow the rules", Drzewiecki told Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we have assured UEFA president Platini that the preparation for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer from that".
Only in the last season many first division clubs were convicted of manipulating relegation to the lower division, eventually the division board had to be postponed as well.
Dennis Quaid's counterattack is outraged
She wanted to promote a new movie, she was talking in an interview about her private life - and she's having problems with her ex-husband: Hollywood star Meg Ryan designated her ex-husband as an adulterer.
He gets angry and counterattacks.
The backward war of the two roses in the ex-couple of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: eight years after their divorce the two Hollywood actors publicly show an unpleasant fight between them.
Last week in an interview with the American magazine InStyle Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for the failure of the marriage: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful".
She only learned the extent of her infidelity after the divorce.
The reason for the disclosure of the private stuff was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" - it tells a story of a failed marriage.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to the designation of him as an unfaithful husband was clear: It's "unheard of how Meg often tells the story of our relationship in another version", the 54-year-old told "New York Daily News".
Among other things, it is very "sad" that Jack, his 16-year-old son, is again "going to remember in public the pain and the changes, all that divorce means to a child".
While Ryan lives alone after the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently fathered twins.
And so he ends his remarks by emphasizing: "My life goes on, however.
I feel happy because I have a wonderful family that is doing well".
Airline and hotel prices are falling
In the first half of 2008, airfares and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a recent study, airline tickets in Germany became as much as 50 percent cheaper.
Airline tickets and hotel stays became cheaper again - this is the result of a study by travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company has analysed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and after the price increase in the first quarter it found a big change in the second half.
After many years of hotel prices rising, overnight stays in many places became cheap.
Compared with last year, prices in 41 of the 48 different cities in Europe rose by an average of 6.9 per cent between January and March.
From April to June prices have already fallen to 3.6 percent compared to last year.
The trends were most noticeable in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason was the weakened dollar, which caused "the interest of American tourists in travel to decline".
The fall in hotel prices is also much more pronounced in financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than in industrial centres such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices rose to 26.3 percent, breaking a record in Europe.
In the first quarter airfares also showed upward trends:
Due to the increase in kerosene prices, economy class travellers had to pay on average 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, long-haul flights even became more expensive up to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, prices of airline tickets in Economy class, compared to the previous quarter, fell on average to 12.5 percent, but price changes for Business class and First class were small.
In Germany the price change was more marked than in other European countries:
From January to February prices rose to 11.9, in the second half they fell to 23.6 percent.
According to one study, prices for domestic flights in Germany even fell by half.
The reason for the price change is the increase in the economy, the company explains.
In many parts of the air travel market demand is falling.
On the other hand, there is great competition for the Open-Skies treaty which liberalizes air traffic between the USA and Europe.
The sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of non-profit-making flights by airlines, as well as a large number of airlines which declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods the SV Hamburg becomes the leader.
Luhukay from Borussia has not yet come out to score the 11th goal.
Kristoffer Klein presented the forced landing of national team player Marko Martin very well.
Gladbach's player started late and failed to score.
Everything he wanted to say exactly in reaction to what had happened, I could read clearly from his lips.
I just knew I was right.
"We need a second goal", whistled Hermann Rieger at the cockpit entrance of the Hamburg stadium.
Nothing special happened in the catacombs, the rest time was over and most of the attendees were back in their places.
Rieger was for almost three decades a physiotherapist for HSV, enjoying a very high reputation as one of those who formed a part of the group.
That's why his request was noted from a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol the assistant coach nodded and raised his fingers in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, the head coach of Hamburg.
His order was the same: Wow, the second goal!
But that was not realized.
"Not everything was pleasant to see today", Marcell Jansen added later.
Bastian Reinhard had also wished to have him "more relaxed".
The result 1:0 (1:0) Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petric (11) with his head impact; and also to the situation that the very weak Gladbach team could not show all their strength to the weak Hamburg team.
"That was a dirty win", Martin Jol summed up.
This Monday the Hamburg SV will be 121 years old.
On Saturday the spectators had already celebrated themselves, the blue sky over the stadium and the change of board on the video screen.
It's going to be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to interpret it", said Marcell Jansen.
It anticipates that the partial ratings in the table correspond more to the league's speed than to the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its late players such as the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen who was removed from FC Bayern need time to get together, but still the team can not shine with their successes.
"We need more feeling and dribbling", Jol demands.
After the vote defeat
Wall Street is spreading fear.
The first news of the failure of the bailout package for the banks caused the Down Jones to drop for a period to 700 points.
That was the biggest one-day point loss in their history.
Then the Dow Jones got a little bit better.
At about 8:30 p.m. one of the world's most important stock market barometers listed a deficit of 5 percent at 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq, the electronic stock market, dropped more than seven percent to 1,548 points.
At this time the biggest losers on the Dow Jones were American Express which lost almost 14 percent and Bank of America with a loss of almost 12 percent.
No title could gain in value.
Goldmann Sachs bank's shares were losing almost 10 percent.
Only a few days ago, a major investor, Warren Buffet, had a financial stake in the company.
The rescue plan provides for the provision of resources to buy so-called "rotten" mortgage shares.
But the sum will be paid out at once if not step by step.
As compensation for this, the state has to receive the share option receipts for the financial associations which during the course of the course can be collected to reduce the financial burden on the state treasury.
Shares prices in Europe and the US continue to fall
The aid of one billion for banks in Europe and the USA does not reassure investors.
The share price of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate is falling and is negatively influencing the Dax.
Despite the state-projected bailout of the financial market, the U.S. Dow Jones continues to fall.
The losses on the speculative shares of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank caused the German index (Dax) to fall into a large deficit.
Despite bailout actions by the federal government and private banks, the stock of the Munich real estate financier for a period of time lost two-thirds of its value, the Comerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
The Dax fell clearly below the psychological limit of 6000 points and traded a deficit of 3.7 percent at 5,839 units.
Financial markets around the world suffered a downturn.
The opening of the Wall Street day in New York began with notable losses.
Investors fear that the US government's $700 billion bailout package will not be enough to boost financial markets.
In the first hour after the opening, the Dow dropped 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the bailout bill, the Senate vote could be October 1.
The other European balls also knew only one trend: at first the FTSE index in London fell by 3.2 per cent, the CAC 40 in Paris fell by 2.9 per cent.
In Asia the Japanese Nikkei main index after profits fell to 1.26 percent at 11,743.61 units.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell to 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India the main index Sensex lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12,595.75 units.
After the capital increase was announced, Arcandor's shares lost on the MDax.
The private bank Sal Oppenheim has subscribed 23 million new shares.
In addition, the tourism and trade consortium announced that the shares in Thoms Cook would not be sold.
Dark matter influences the trajectory of space probes
For many years a mysterious phenomenon has been causing researchers to bewilderment: Dark Matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational assistance to maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's theory of relativity may not be so accurate.
The spacecraft "Ulysses" spent almost 18 years in space.
Because the fuel pipes are freezing now you're threatened with death in the cold.
For years a mysterious phenomenon, the anomaly during gravitational assistance to the maneuver, has been causing confusion among researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a maneuver of the trajectory of space probes during which they obtain an acceleration using the energy of the gravitational field of a planet, for example the Earth.
That allows space probes to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American spacecraft, used this physical trick just as the Ulysses Sun probe did.
But what surprised researchers for many years: The missiles do not behave 100 percent as expected by the venerable law of gravity.
They're more likely to have speed irregularities.
Suddenly the probes are going up or down.
Physicists couldn 't explain this effect until now .
They called it the gravity assist anomaly during the maneuver.
Some experts fear that possibly even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity that describes the force of attraction of matter by the curvature of space may not be so accurate.
Stephen Adler, the American physicist at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, solemnly believes now as before that Einstein did not confuse and tries to explain the anomaly during gravitational assistance with the help of so-called Dark Matter, which left astronomers in the universe.
"The reason for the anomaly may be dark matter which may also be very close to Earth", he writes.
Researchers of the universe have known about the existence of dark matter for only ten years.
She supposedly possesses the force of attraction and her influence can be observed on other planets.
Dark matter, on the other hand, is completely invisible, which means it sends out and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, dark matter makes up at least one fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
As confirmed by the Italian foreign minister, after spending ten days in the hands of kidnappers, the tourists kidnapped in Egypt must be released.
The Sudanese kidnappers had demanded millions of the ransom.
Six kidnappers are to be killed in a shootout during the liberation.
Five Germans are kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The negotiations on the ransom have already begun.
Germans always fall back into the spotlight of the kidnappers.
The newspaper WELT ONLINE reports on the most important cases.
Apparently the European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are being released.
The same information is provided by the Egyptian state television, the Arabic television station Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
After the news of the release on the Italian broadcaster Sky TG 24, Franco Frattini, the Italian foreign minister, confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages are released.
'We are now monitoring his health,' said Frattini.
Five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian woman as well as their eight Egyptian companions are safe and secure, Egyptian state television reports.
The 19 participants of the desert expedition are on their way to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible are the reasons for a shootout before the hostages were released: According to the descriptions of an Egyptian security guard, the kidnappers were ready to end the abduction, but the Sudanese army had suddenly killed six of the abductors.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to the ransom", the guard said.
It was all about "receiving the hostages" when all of a sudden "this surprise" came along.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers killed six kidnappers and arrested two of them in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers have demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany, the money for which was to be given to the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom", referring to a German mediator, reported that the release was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers intend to release the female hostages after they have received the ransom.
The men had to stay in custody until the kidnappers had a safe route to escape.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on this report.
Stepfather abuse "led to suicide"
According to the court, years of abuse by her stepfather led one woman to kill herself.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after he pleaded guilty to eight counts of indecent assault.
The Royal Court of Truro, through an inquiring study, learned that he had regularly bound his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession paper, "I feel responsible for his death".
The court heard that Mrs Randle committed suicide at her Mutley home in Plymouth on 1 April 2007, aged 34.
During the time the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to tie her up and blindfold her before performing her sexual acts, while her mother was working in a pub.
After the 1980 divorce, Trerise returned to live in Cornwall.
His stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Mrs. Randle, who spent much of her time working as a volunteer for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse she had been inflicted twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife referred to the court what some friends of Ms. Rande had said of her, that after having been a great surfer and cyclist, she now seemed "emotionally dead", as if she had "renounced life".
In April 2007 her real father, Terraza Randle, found the woman dead in her Plymouth apartment.
Mrs. Rande is supposed to have killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession letter that concludes: "I used to tie her up and blow her eyes out.
It was never a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death".
Judge Christopher Elwen replied to Trerise: "You are a very strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been a terrible experience, especially when you were only seven years old.
This unpleasant saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even more clear, if she had not done so, the matter probably would not have ended up in court".
He added: "I have noticed the effect that Stephanie's father and mother described the abuse as having on their daughter over the years.
Clearly she could have had a promising, successful, happy future".
An officer charged with data loss
The BBC has been informed that a Cabinet official who forgot some secret documents on the train in June is to be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on a business trip for the Ministry of Defence, left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It is certainly the least serious charge under the law and does not constitute any indication of intent to commit a crime.
BBC Defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the conviction came as a surprise to many in the British administration.
"They thought it was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet", he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause that refers to the safeguarding of information.
The Royal Legal Service pointed out that the official should be charged by the Metropolitan Police, because of the highly sensitive nature of his work in the Secret Services Committee.
The forgotten documents contained classified information about al-Qaeda and the capabilities of the security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision Monday morning and immediately moved from his home to a secret location.
Construction companies face the price of B&B
In Britain, building societies could face a price of over £80,000 following the rescue of the Bradford and Bingley bank.
The government, in effect, provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of the bank's 2.6 million savers.
The interest on the loan will be paid by all the companies using the savers' money, including the 59 construction companies.
The Director-General of the Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers it "humiliating" that the societies and their members have to pay
Eventually, the $14 billion loan should be repaid after the Bradford and Bingley mortgages are redeemed.
However, interest accruing in the meantime is assumed to be charged annually to the 700 financial companies that have deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies are included in that number.
It is humiliating that institutions that behaved prudently... are called upon to pay today the price of institutions that have been far less prudent.
The Commission has not yet adopted a decision on the application of Article 4 (1) of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006.
In other words, each company had to pay in proportion to the bank deposits, and the intermediary companies had to pay approximately 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the loan will amount to £450,000 in 2009.
This means that the companies will have to recover £81,000 to meet the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, director general of the Building Companies Trade Association, told the BBC that this situation is unfair.
"It is humiliating that institutions that behaved prudently in the growth of the housing market are called upon to pay the price produced by those that were much less prudent".
According to the BSA, there is no data indicating the failure of any society since 1945.
"We will need to examine all aspects of this matter in the coming weeks to find out what options exist to protect the building societies and their members from what could be a relevant price", Mr Cole added.
The interest accrued in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September 2009 to March 2009.
In 2010, it will be a full year of interest payable, which may be almost double.
As building societies are mutual organizations and have no shareholders, their members will inevitably end up paying the price, either through higher rates or lower interest on their savings.
The price of milk rises by five pence a litre
The inhabitants of the Jersey shore will have to pay more for their milk.
The Jersey Dairy has announced that the highest price of dairy products will rise by an extra five pence a litre from next Monday.
This is the second price increase this year, after a two pence increase in February and following investigations by a consultancy firm.
Traders can decide for themselves whether they want to apply price increases for their customers.
The last time the highest milk price had risen before February was in 2002.
Former Bangladesh Prime Minister denied bail
A Bangladeshi court has rejected the request for bail for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, meaning she could be taken to jail when she returns to her country.
His defenders said the court did not grant him bail accusing him of extorting 50 million taka ($729,700) from a businessman when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of several corruption charges against him.
His long-time political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina's return to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the coming weeks, but her party, the Awami League, has demanded that the country's military-backed government first grant her full freedom.
Correspondents say that while she was given conditional release to go abroad and receive medical treatment, it is not clear now what the terms of her release are or whether she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say they're going to appeal to the Supreme Court against the High Court order.
"The Supreme Court rejected the request for bail for Sheikh Hasina on the grounds that she could not obtain bail because she was already under treatment abroad under conditional release", said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We're going to appeal the Supreme Court's order".
Her advocates argued that she needed bail to return to her country from abroad and prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina should return to her homeland after October 17, according to an Awami League leader last Sunday.
She was detained last year after the military-backed interim government took power, but was released in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all the charges against them.
Fears for the campaign against polio in Afghanistan
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan - UN says - have been denied access to a recent polio vaccination campaign because of Taliban violence.
Last week the United Nations carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports that it was unable to reach children in some parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
A UN spokesman said it happened despite promises made by the Taliban that they would not have attacked or hindered thousands of officials while they carried out the vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal challenge at ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge to the Competition Commission following the decision to reduce its stake in rival broadcaster ITV.
BSkyB has been informed by the Competition Appeals Tribunal that it will have to reduce its 17,9% stake in ITV to below 7,5%.
The Commission has previously stated that BSkyB's interests hinder competition and allow its unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought its share package in 2006 in a deal that effectively blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Antitrust Office reported that BSkyB's acquisition of the stake in ITV raised doubts about ITV's independence, and prompted the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
Everyone, including Virgin's boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the regulator Ofcom opposed the purchase.
BSkyB, commented that the compulsion to reduce its package on ITV was unreasonable and constituted a disproportionate remedy, particularly because, BSkyB said, it would have surrendered its voting rights.
New investigation into the hiring of US lawyers
The Attorney General of the United States has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the firing of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticized the actions of administration officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Producer General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by the fear that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Counsel Nora Dannehy is investigating whether the officials questioned during the investigation lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
"Serious allegations of possible criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved", Attorney General Glenn Bellas states in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to compel witnesses to give their statements.
The discussion began when nine U.S. attorneys were removed from their positions by the Justice Department in December 2006.
At the time, the department reasoned the decision by suggesting that the lawyers had been fired for poor performance.
But it later emerged that the lawyers had not been rated worse than their colleagues, and many observers concluded that the dismissals would be politically motivated.
Some of the lawyers in question had worked on the prosecution of high-profile Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of voter fraud against Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and prosecute court cases for the government.
And they can be fired at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The next head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure from the layoffs, resigned his position.
A number of other officials from the Justice Department did the same.
The Attorney General's report is highly critical of the role played by Mr Gonzales in the matter, and underlines how he had a "primary responsibility" for the dismissals, that he "abdicated" from his leadership position and was "notably non-collaborative" in the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, Bush's former aide, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The epic of Meat Loaf of great honor
Rock star Meat Loaf is being honored at the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive the special award next week at the ceremony in London, said it would be "an honour" to receive the award.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
The band Coldplay are taking the nominations for this year's awards and doing the ranking for all four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that transcend time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them".
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires an excellent vocal ability like the one used by Meat Loaf.
An instrumental section of nearly two minutes opens the anthem.
The song was first released as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached number 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's Bat Out Of Hell stayed on the charts for about nine years and went on to sell over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including surgery for his cardiac arrhythmia in 2003, after collapsing during a concert.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
It later turned out that he had a cyst on his vocal cords.
Dark city street, often forgotten and perhaps ready for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets, and other roads, some famous, others simply for service.
However, many people, including veteran taxi drivers and longtime local residents, find it difficult to pinpoint the location of the Extra Place, especially since many of them have never heard of this street.
The little street is in the East Village and it stretches north from First Street before I found Second Street - between the Bowery and Second Avenue.
This little alley, about 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, resembles a dusty alley more than a busy road.
There's no sign of him.
It's practically impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has admirers.
For example, there's Avalon Bay, the company that recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
He wants to repaint Extra Place and create a clean aisle to the shops and boutiques that he hopes to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include old-time neighbors who commented being delighted by the truncated lane simply because it is one of the last remnants of the block's past before the buildings were appropriated.
However, the Department of Housing, Preservation and City Development, which has control of the street, has no interest in owning it.
At the Community Vintage Committee meeting for land use that took place this month, representatives from the Avalon agency outlined a proposal to buy the street.
However, the committee, preferring the street to remain in the city, asked for a new plan to be presented next month, as stated by Susan Stetzer, the district manager of Community No. 3.
"The city owns very few spaces today and we would like it to continue to own Extra Place", said Mrs.
"We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage the space, but we also want to ensure public access to the street".
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that it wanted to repair the small street and install some seating, including some to be used as a cafe, while waiting to rent the spaces.
The idea that Avalon might buy the street first came up during the meeting this month.
But Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the street, it didn't necessarily want to own it.
"Avalon Bay's primary concern is the renovation of this abandoned alley and the possibility of turning it into a public area", he said, adding that the sale proposal came from the city itself.
Don Sethlin, a spokesman for the Committee for Preservation, confirmed that it was the city's desire to sell the street and noted that the agency's mission is to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful surroundings, those of the Bowery, Extra Place has left a mark on history.
Some believe it got its name in 1802, when the large estate owned by Philip Minthorne was divided between his sons and this narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock landmark that closed in 2006, opens at Extra Place, but the street is perhaps best known for the photograph of the establishment that appears on the cover of the Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
"The setting was magnificent", commented Danny Fields, the Ramones' manager, who took the photograph in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, pieces of clothing and pieces of barrels, signs, leaves, ropes".
Some residents, including bloggers writing about the upscale East Village, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public property, however modest, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare piece, virtually unchanged, a city slice that should be protected.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has made available part of a talk on the city's history about Extra Place, published by The New Yorker in 1952.
Author Brendan Gill wrote: "Extra Place is a somewhat narrow and dead-end alley, dark also by day and marked by rusty iron warehouse doors and counter-windows, with week-old newspapers blown along the gutters".
With few exceptions, the street looked more or less the same on a recent afternoon.
A rat cured through the back of the street and stood near the door that used to be used to enter the CBGB and now houses a luxury clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls and an empty 22-oz beer bottle were near a new batch of discarded newspapers.
Some interns said they rarely paid attention to Extra Place, but suggested it could be cleaned up.
Mr Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimate the attractive power of the street in its present state.
"I spent the best years of my life", he said, "in dark, damp, disgusting places".
The debate on bilingualism: immersion in the English language
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss candidate positions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a longtime associate in California studies and director of studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice".
Effectively calling Hispanic voters is a tough business.
The education proposals made by Barack Obama are an example of that.
Mr. Obama's campaign notes that "African-American and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students", and this is a very true consideration.
To combat such differences in learning outcomes, Obama's education plan specifically advocates, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for English-speaking learners.
However, the open question for Mr. Obama is whether the commitment to bilingual education, which prefers teaching in classrooms in languages other than English, is effective in overcoming the distance in the final results.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized elementary school in the eastern region of Los Angeles County.
At this school the vast majority of students are Hispanic and from low-income families:
More than a third of the students, many of whom are newcomers, are learning English.
Yet an incredible 100 percent of fourth-year students have been rated positive in the 2008 maths exam.
And almost an equally astonishing 93 percent have mastered the English and arts test.
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient than the one Mr. Obama favors.
Sixth Street School emphasizes review and practice, constant assessment of competence, and does not tolerate any attitude of excuses.
Also, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the Sixth Street principal, the school's approach to teaching English to students is "full immersion".
English immersion means the almost exclusive use of the language in the processing of the contents of the instruction.
Mrs. Mikels, who is opposed to bilingual education, told me, "We've had extraordinary success with students like this one who's come from Mexico and if you walk into the classroom 12 months later you won't be able to pick up what was".
"It works", he pointed out, "we think it works".
Will Mr. Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model to replicate for other schools with large Hispanic-English student populations?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the answer, but the idea of his party's politicians on the issue of education (the National Education Associations have long been advocates of bilingual education) and their very constant support for bilingual education obscures the prediction of Mr. Obama's response.
While it is true that immigrants should learn English, recently Mr. Obama has trivialized the issue by leaving people to stop worrying about legislation that is written only in English.
And instead, he said, "You have to make sure your child can speak Spanish".
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close loopholes, he should carefully consider the models of education that work well, rather than discounting or trivializing them.
Oil prices plummet after renewed economic fears
Oil prices dropped sharply on Monday amid concerns that the U.S. financial markets bailout may not be able to revive the economy.
Crude oil stocks fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel in the morning trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has dropped by more than 20 dollars a barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by the financial crisis on Wall Street and a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After hitting a high of $145.29 a barrel in July, prices had fallen to nearly $90 a barrel earlier this month, before falling back again because of the huge uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety gripped investors once again on Monday, despite congressional leaders saying they had reached a deal over the weekend on the largest bailout in history.
The news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
The latest development in the merger process confirms that Citigroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, according to the government's announcement on Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said that, in the frenetic weekend, the negotiations that led to the bailout deal "seem to have failed to revive market sentiment".
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to fall.
"The outlook for global equity, interest rates and exchange rates will become increasingly uncertain", analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that the basic products will not be able to escape this contagion.
From a product perspective, our most pressing concern is the assessment of whether the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China".
The bank's analysts have lowered their expectations for next year as oil consumption falls due to the crisis in economic growth and the forecast for oil and gas price reduction is 20 percent for 2009.
Second quarter of madness: team sets record
After spending the last eight seasons, more time than anyone else in the Jets uniform, playing defense, Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen it all.
Then he watched things unfold in the second quarter this Sunday, when the Jets turned a no-hitter into a deflationary game.
"I've never seen anything like it", Ellis remarked.
The second quarter began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals had played lazy under the shadows of the clouds.
At this point, quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles making a 12-yard field goal and suggesting the perfect omen for an afternoon, when the evolution of the relationship between the players had a big leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more goals in the fourth, one of these when a cornerback fell and another came with 10 seconds left in the half.
"I didn't get out of my way", said Favre of all the steps that went to Coles.
"He's a devil of a player.
Our communication has been great, regardless of what people may think".
While Favre and Coles were playing in the dam, the Cardinals defense was abusing quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a running shot and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith pointed at another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens was forced to miss by Warner.
In the last turnover, the fouls forced by Bowens, could have been the best.
The Cardinals had taken possession with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely kicked it 20 yards to win a final 34-0.
That's the most points the Jets have ever scored in a quarter.
Team coach Eric Mangini, asked to describe the craziness of this moment, said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When asked about both - the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can say that I liked the second quarter a lot more than the third.
They've earned a lot of points in a very short period of time".
Gebrselassie resting tops his world record
Once again, Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has proven why many consider him the greatest runner in history, beating his own world record at the Berlin Marathon this Sunday and becoming the first person able to run the 26.2 mile race in 2 hours 4 minutes.
After winning the comfortable flat race in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie has broken his previous record of 2:04:26, set last year in Berlin, by 27 seconds.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has set the world record number 26 in a race of an impressive length so he has set a world championship or a world record for any distance, from the time trial to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie did not compete in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect - that air pollution would aggravate her asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up to race in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie won this Sunday, averaging a cutting 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have become long-distance runners, the marathon record has shrunk by more than two minutes in the last decade, as Brazil's Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After last Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that he had suffered calf cramps two weeks earlier and had missed a week of training.
It's obvious the suspension left him fresh, not rusted.
"I'm very happy", Gebrselassie said to reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I had some doubts, but in the end everything went well".
The athlete has been the subject of some criticism - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's Afro-Eastern rival - for the style of over-orchestrating his races, generally avoiding the encounter with many world marathon stars, relying on pacemakers as if it were a race track, and putting records ahead of the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie's skills as a runner.
On Sunday, with four Kenyans, Gebrselassie reached the halfway point in 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began challenging Gebrselassie after his pacemakers declined.
But just three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie took a final push to part ways with Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal best by almost five minutes.
Kamathi came in third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan but now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year by winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36, was a surprise and won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She also did not compete in the Beijing Games for what was described as a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin and set her personal best in almost five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
He made a clever calculation run, letting a quartet of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners do the head and then recovering them after 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia won second place in 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a city apart, the pride and trials of colored life
Hidden by the expansion of the Orlando theme park, a few miles from the bright, noisy, and colossal city, is a quiet town, where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are all too evident.
Eatonville, the first fully incorporated black-inhabited city in the country and the childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 men of color, 300 good swimmers, many guayabas, two schools and not a jail".
It's a place of pilgrimage now.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! fair in Eatonville to pay tribute to Mrs. Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, in many ways, the city she described - making it also a tourist stage by including it in the Florida travel guide produced by the Federal Writers Project during the Depression - is still a place apart.
The city remains independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Mrs. Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their true ideas with the white man, who "knows so little about us and who doesn't know what he's missing".
Even now, in the year that a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has called attention to starting a dialogue on the issue of race, many are still wary of the outsider.
"We're very cautious about how our story is told", said Jones Hortense, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the city's oldest church.
"It has to be right".
Eatonville has always been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is at the same time a historic model of the affirmation of blacks and a community of nearly 2,400 people living below a poverty level twice the national average.
It's a literary center, but also a restored example of the rural black southern culture - sometimes disregarded, sometimes praised - that was born out of slavery in America.
No wonder, if those who reside here are both proud and reserved.
And the concern for Eatonville's image really started with Zora, as no one here calls her Mrs Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through her profound dialect books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed the city, just off Route 17, a road that runs through central Florida often forgotten inward about black history and human drama.
With a face of cement in both life and literature, Mrs. Hurston took her readers to the store owned by the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then into more private areas.
"Off the road on the left", he wrote, "is the modern brown public school with its white finishes, its well-kept gardens and playgrounds, cared for by Howard Miller, as he can scarcely read and write".
She also mentions the widow Dash's new husband and writes that Glenn Lee "sells all kinds of drinks and anything goes with transient rooms".
So in just a few hundred words Mrs Hurston relates Eatonville to self-government, but also to illiteracy, second marriages and sex.
Obviously, this Fodor didn't.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
"Zora described it as it was", said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of the Johnson girls that Mrs. Hurston immortalized by quoting men who were singing colourless songs about her beauty.
He added: "Some people didn't like that".
Mrs. Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who returned frequently after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77, recalls that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in town, she did so without warning in a large Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still prides itself on dressing with dignity.
Most residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many laughed sarcastically.
"People were always very happy to see Zora", Mr. Franklin continues.
But, she adds, swinging in her chair in a backyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Mrs. Hurston was likely baptized, "she never stayed too long".
When Mrs Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were no longer in print.
Like most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only woman of color at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had been living.
In Eatonville, there were no great memorial ceremonies, no great public readings.
"I don't think her contribution to the world or her legacy was understood", said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography of Mrs. Hurston published in 2003.
A certain turn came in the '80s.
Orange County officials wanted to put a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-lane street in the labor community.
The expansion of the Orlando area had already pushed Interstate 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the community's relatively idyllic isolation.
In the 1950s, the fight for racial blending brought hatred about the community.
"During that season, a group of white boys, they were going around town throwing oranges and everything at the people who were sitting next to them", said Mr. Franklin.
"They killed a girl once too.
They threw him into a watermelon from the car".
In a 1955 letter to Mrs. Hurston, she wrote to The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the Supreme Court's forced integration that, in Brown v. Board of Education, "insulted rather than honored my race".
R Residents say today that the desegregation of schools, which was positive in some respects, had weakened Eatonville's cohesion and undermined the confidence of its young people.
"Black kids were used to being hugged - I remember this  they used to hug the teacher in the morning and in the evening", said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a nonprofit organization.
This lasted, he added, until teachers and students did not come from the same place.
"I wasn't hugging your teacher because she was white - there's a cultural gap there", said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped create space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons  black writers, actors and artists who stepped above prejudice, just as she did, with buoyant, confident lines like, "How can anyone deny himself the pleasure of my company!
I don't understand that".
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Mrs. Hurston's anonymous grave and began a fight to resurrect her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Mrs. Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in bookstores, reintroducing her to the American canon.
The road project came just as Eatonville's most famous daughter was once again in the spotlight.
And this time, Mrs. Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community started planning a fair for Mrs. Hurston to show what the county could ruin with that road.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its proposed highway.
"The idea of the resurrected five-lane road, would have been to put in what you would call curvature speed, a real civic pride", said Mrs. Nathiri.
Mrs Boyd said it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville".
The victory over the road project has helped change the image of the city itself.
Out-of-towners like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to the church here in 1993, started showing up in large numbers, and residents started looking back.
Eatonville was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.
A new library (named after Hurston, of course) opened in 2006, on a paved and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can, at times, feel like a street from the past in a summer rain, in a town as small as the one founded by just 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of people are black today.)
Outsiders who come looking for Eatonville's history, for its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A prior permission is required to do most interviews, and some things - like the murals in Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the fields - cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a courageous and convinced teacher who has a soft spot for bright red, still fear that her island community may be misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has expanded, a greater level of Christmas pride has also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville the same way Mrs. Hurston saw all of her race: beauty, and all the problems, no better, no worse, and equally to the other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, hardworking, silly and mixed.
It is a sincere sense of civic what can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who is planning to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or the Police Department, who said he might need some help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, if they dare come here, will have to think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to any other,'" says Alondra Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at its history, it's a very nice city".
Here in New York, everybody is talking about finance.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from newsstands and the giant TV screens in Times Square, they would not realize they were in the eye of the hurricane.
They could never imagine that behind the glass facade of the beehive offices that lie above their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York face daily the worst "bad office day" since the 1929 slump.
Home delivery guys keep sounding their metal tea carts through the sidewalks and carrying muffin trays for breakfast meetings.
Latino men still crawl between loaded apartment buildings, like human mules, with 50 eccentrically stamped shirts hanging from a yoke across their shoulders. Office workers still wait in line for their morning takeout, and it's still impossible to catch a taxi between 4 and 7 p.m. on weekdays.
Employees still wait in line for their bagels at the vendors' carts, and yet it is impossible to find a taxi between four and five o'clock in the afternoon on weekdays.
It seemed like there was no crisis at all, until this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts out there, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had calculated the time needed for the operation to coincide with the calm of the late afternoon at my local JP Morgan Chase branch, a line of about 20 people was already waiting.
And not in front of the employee's window, to withdraw their cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer service bank, where lifelong customers order their checkbooks, tourists seek directions to Macy's department stores, and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people were ahead of me, I was later informed by Starr, my "personal trusted banker", and they were in line for the same reason I was.
Unlike me, they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks in places where they had switched them from, places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had taken their money from so-called savings associations (sort of like a building society), credit unions and savings banks in their hometown whose branches only operate within the state of their ownership, and who say they treat customers like family.
Over the past year, 15 of these banks have quietly failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went bankrupt, and as New Yorkers headed home Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion in savings deposits, was looking for a bailout buyer.
The office and store workers who stood in front of me, fearing another collapse, were moving their money to a bank to what is considered a safe haven, which is what most bailouts on Wall Street are doing.
Ordinary New Yorkers have become financial experts in recent weeks.
A woman at my local Chinese supermarket, talking on the phone, was referring to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and its grim-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, was talking about the matter with familiarity as if they were complaining about a colleague's inactivity.
And Lyn, the 50-something janitor in uniform from my apartment block, has changed the normal course of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my grocery shopping.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that "I now have all my savings in money market funds.
The switch is made, I'm not taking any risks".
Muslim graves desecrated as Austria approaches to the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, of the left wing of the far-right Freedom of Austria party, and Belgian Filip Dewinter, of the far-right Vlaams Belang party, take part in a demonstration to present the organization "Cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry traffic signs representing mosques with a red line running through them.
Police are blaming right-wing extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend that right-wing political parties made huge gains in the country's general election.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged at the Traun cemetery near Linz sometime between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was an organized action.
Criminals sprayed Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David, on some of the graves, but researchers think this may have been an attempt to hide the real motives of extremists driven by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It's unclear if the incident was in any way related to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration, which reached Muslim worshippers as the month of Ramadan was winding down.
Meanwhile, Austria is preparing for a round of introspection after the right-wing swing in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that garnered nearly 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, had conducted a campaign focused on vehement anti-immigration and some of their slogans were considered xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against headscarves and burkas, and also expressed his opposition to foods considered to be related to Islam.
At their last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both parties are trying to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they were symbols of the ongoing Islamization policy in Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which confirmed the far right as the country's strongest political bloc, indicate that the change was mainly caused by young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel ban for Gary Glitter
Courts have banned Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, from traveling to France and Spain.
Magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the surveillance authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
Kent police issued the travel ban last Thursday after magistrates produced evidence of Glitter's previous convictions for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford Magistrates Court in Kent, but was represented by the solicitor Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: "On Thursday 25 September at Ashford Magistrates Court in Kent, the police requested a provision to prevent Mr Paul Gadd's travel abroad to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd did not attend in person".
Glitter, 64, had informed authorities that he wished to travel abroad, under the power of being under the sex offender register.
He has to inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days
and you must also notify the police of the planned date seven days before your departure.
Kent police said they wouldn't discuss the individual case or Glitter's possible whereabouts in the county.
A Kent Police spokesman said: "Kent Police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or abroad.
A Kent Police spokesman said: "Kent Police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or abroad.
"From our point of view, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the UK because here we have the systems to manage all possible risks more effectively.
"Protecting Kent residents is Kent Police's top priority and we work closely to monitor the behavior of registered sex offenders in the county and minimize any risk to the public".
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls, aged between 10 and 11.
When he was released Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he caught a flight to London.
However, he said he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport control and he eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted he return to Britain.
He probably arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on 22 August and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge Magistrates Court, west London, after Scotland Yard had successfully applied for registration as a sex offender.
Glitter had been jailed in the UK for four months in 1999 for possession of child abuse images.
A source from the Ministry of Interior Affairs reported that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of Interior was reassured and pleased to learn that Glitter had been banned from traveling to France and Spain.
"I catch the master off-scene to extract his character" Günther Bauer_Photographer
No heels or flyers or opening suits.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration in the performance to get the relaxed aspect of the man or woman.
Put the artist aside.
The other, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in those moments away from the public, when you find the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen gaze or the expressiveness of a hand, carefree because it's not going to come out on stage.
The German Günther Bauer alters in "Flamenco-people" the theatricality of some staging with singers, dancers and guitarists with that less known side of these masters.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular iconography of flamenco from different areas.
Included in the programming of the Month of Flamenco Photography, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, growing every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco-people" "can be anyone but, when looking at the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists on the stage.
These people portrayed "on the street" are artists capable of transmitting on stage passion, sadness, joy... captivating the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists, you don't have to take pictures of the stage.
They have their personality and character in them.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the great flamenco players".
With the flavor of the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer began in 1997 a long journey to portray the singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
These are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and the material, recall the classic photography.
The application of different stylistic means breaks with the classical basis of the image, giving it modernity, an idea that reflects how Bauer himself understands flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, that evolves and surprises every day".
It is not the act of the dance, the singing or the playing itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, that captivates the audience with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essential, with the duende that becomes visible in a way of feeling, of being and of being are and have been the constant of this work that is presented these days in the gallery El Fotómata.
Famous flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are the focus of this selection of almost seventy photographed artists.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited in the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of Veteran Athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "I love to portray people, meet them and be able to enter an instant in their life, be it a long or short instant.
I think within photography the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or face people, characters, that sometimes you don't even know, or that give you only a few minutes to take the photo.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true".
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people", is exhibited in the El Fotómata Gallery, located at number 20 of the Mata street, parallel to the Alameda de Hércules, where it can be visited until next October 16.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "a temerity"
It is set in places he does not yet know and deals with unknown issues, but still, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to bring forward the new project he is working on, a novel that has as its protagonist Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and passed through the Amazon.
The always favourite for the Nobel Prize in Literature confessed yesterday in his passage through the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that occupies him today "is a temerity" and that "everything indicates that I should not write" the novel.
"If I were sensible, I wouldn't do it, but I'm going to do it and I hope to finish it someday", he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days has seen a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people pass through the city of the Aqueduct.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the leading figures of the third edition of the festival of the word and fulfilled the predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival prize for being the most voted writer by the participants - an old edition of "Our mutual friend", by Dickens-, filled the theater's Juan Bravo foyer.
Presented by Félix Romeo, he found a dedicated audience who was made very short the hour in which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, reviewed how his literary vocation was born in him, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "pleasure of reading" and "living more than he lived"; how he writes in a "disciplined way" to fill his "lack of inspiration" with an intense work of documentation, correcting and redoing much; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his vocation and what "images of memory" are the basis on which their stories are sustained.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience", said Vargas Llosa, who said that this "has effects" and "makes people more uncomfortable", so he asked the writers "not to abandon themselves to frivolity" and "assume with responsibility" their vocation.
The weather is killing the Pozoblanco fair, which is also running out of parts
The celebration of regions that closed the abono of the Pozoblanco fair was suspended in the morning of yesterday, after checking the rejoneadores announced that the floor of the square was not in the best conditions.
Thus, the company, according to Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
The weather has been bad for the fair, as two of its three celebrations have not been held.
On Saturday it was the rain that prevented the second bullfighting event.
The cartel was composed of José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who were going to face an encerro of Castilblanco
So, only Friday there was celebration.
In it, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut off three ears and came out on his shoulders, after leaving passages with taste and aesthetics.
That same afternoon Alejandro Talavante sold his two astados with greetings and an ear, which granted more the tended than his bullfight.
Yeah, worse was El Juli, who went through the whole Los Llanos thing without pity or glory.
In his second bull, after a relief effort, he won the ire of a large part of the public.
They skip a checkpoint in Alava in a van with 2,000 kilos of hashish
Five minutes to ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Ertzaintza in the municipality of Armiñón (Álava).
Officers stop the two occupants of a van and they begin to flee.
His cargo, more than two tons of hashish, was too heavy to stop.
The agents pursued and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man, identified as A. A. J., according to a statement from the Basque Government's Interior Department.
The individual arrested has been charged with drug trafficking and forgery of public documents.
The incident occurred when several officials from the Traffic Unit of Álava were carrying out a transport control on the N-1, as they passed through the municipal term of Armiñón.
They were about to stop a van for inspection when the driver disobeyed orders, accelerated abruptly, and skipped control.
Officers began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped a couple of kilometers later in the arc, at which point its two occupants hurried off to run through a wooded area.
The Ertzains finally caught up with one of them and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The back of the vehicle was loaded with hashish, so they proceeded to transfer it to police stations for a thorough inspection and weighing of the drug.
In addition, officials verified that the registration had been "doubled" because it did not coincide with the collection in the documentation of the van, so the arrested has also been charged with a crime of falsification of public document.
The Ertzaintza continues with the investigation to proceed to the arrest of the other suspect, who managed to escape to the race as has been said, and determine the origin of the drug apprehended.
The detainee, A. A. J., 28, was transferred to police dependency to perform the relevant diligence and will be available to the court in the coming hours.
Arrested actress Heather Locklear for driving under the influence of drugs.
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda from the Melrose Place series, has been arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the influence of some drug.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers as she tried to leave her parking lot in Montecito, a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol told People magazine.
The witness detailed that at about 4:30 p.m., Locklear "was stepping on the gas pedal, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the parking lot back and forth, and as he was going backwards, he passed over his sunglasses several times".
Shortly after, the witness, who apparently did not recognize the actress at first, saw Locklear pull over on a nearby highway and get out of the vehicle.
This person was the one who alerted the emergency services because "he was concerned about Locklear's life".
When the police patrol arrived they found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"She seemed disoriented", so officers took her to the drug and alcohol testing center.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and the excess of alcohol was ruled out from the start, although "according to what officers observed at first sight, we believe Locklear was under the influence of some drug".
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an unspecified substance and was booked into the local jail at about 7 p.m. although she was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was released from an Arizona treatment clinic where he was recovering from an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian IU federation to assume its powers in the Silva case
The IU general coordinator and Izquierda Unida deputy, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that the regional federation of training will have to make a decision on the case of the former councilor of Youth and Sports of the City of Sevilla, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after he was accused of making deals in favor of family members.
"I am very federalist for these things, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its competencies", Llamazares said about the action that the party must adopt with which it has so far counciled in the Seville consistory.
However, the IU leader defended the need for "transparency" in possible investigations into irregularities that Silva may have committed: "The IU has always defended that this type of matter has the highest degree of transparency".
In the same vein, he stressed that the training has "strict ethical codes for all public positions".
'Blood of May', the epic gamble of Garci
Inspired by the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous uprising of the Spaniards against the French in Sangre de mayo, which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with about 15 million euros of budget.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried to "illustrate the torrent of characters and social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the tape, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of a wide cast of interpreters.
Sangre de mayo, with a running time of more than two and a half hours, premieres this Friday in cinemas, to become a four-hour miniseries for Telemadrid.
A great admirer of Galdós's literature, José Luis Garci assures that he has fulfilled this filming "a childhood dream", which he must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid commissioned him three years ago to shoot a commemorative tape for the second centenary of 2 May madrileño, something he accepted as long as the story was based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million budget that the Community of Madrid has contributed in its entirety is a "unique opportunity" for Garci to create the right decor and costume for the portrait of "a beleaguered Spain that was mistaken for a leader to fight for, since the struggle for independence led the people to great delay with the reign of Fernando VII", he said.
But the filmmaker regrets not having had funding like Alatriste or Los fantasmas de Goya - more than double that of Sangre de mayo -, so he has not been able to shoot some scenes captured in a script signed with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has collaborated in almost all his career.
For this reason, the director of Volver a commencer, has focused on what is his usual way of work, the staging with the actors, with whom he usually rehearses before starting the shooting and those who do not casting, for appearing "humiliating" and considering that "part of the director's office is to go to the theater and the cinema to know what happens in the industry in which he works".
Many of the performers with whom he coincides in Sangre de mayo repeat before his camera, as is the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Candidate for the Oscar four times - of which he won one -, Garci considers that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Academy of Hollywood, the very Sangre de mayo, Seven French billiard tables and the finally selected, The blind sunflowers, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, "which is the one that should be known", he said.
With this film Garci doesn't expect awards.
"At first you think you're working for posterity, then you realize you're only working for prosperity, and now you're content to make one more film", explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabel Bayón recovers the essence of the sevillana dancer Tórtola Valencia
A Sevillian dancer is going to pay tribute to a Sevillian dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, of Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana neighbourhood and when she was three years old she moved to London with her family.
She was a freestyle dancer and specialist in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, a pioneer of women's liberation, like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated for the abolition of the corset which prevented women's free movement.
The life of this woman, who marked a dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me and I thought it was amazing".
According to the dancer, "we do not intend to tell her life but to collect her spirit.
The titles of your dances have suggested flamenco sticks.
So, "the butterfly dance" suggested to me a guajira, or "the snake dance" a tango.
Their dance was sensual and I have been told that my dance is also within this aesthetic", he says.
The montage has two exceptional collaborations: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing again to Isabel in one of his shows, just as he did in that of "The open door"; and with the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with whoever was his student.
"Matilde plays the elder Tortola, the character of maturity.
I am happy that she has agreed to act in my play and I am very honored for that".
The installation also features the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, the canto of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this type of artists who were divas in all their extension, and who are always in love with them".
The work also tells in some way the life of this woman who developed in places so far away, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, in addition to all over Europe, since she usually resided in London.
"I wanted to remember her because I think she is one of those women who have a huge influence in a certain time and now nobody knows and much less values her work", says Bayón.
The show will start today at 8.30pm at the Lope de Vega theatre.
The publication of the "Diary of a Newly Married Poet" also closes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diary of a Poet Recovered" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), the place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities programmed by the Ministry of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía to celebrate the "Trienio Zenobia y Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized with the aim of commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the death of both.
Thus, the "Trienio Zenobia y Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress held in New York, with the restoration of the Casa Museo del Nobel and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: Aquel lobo de luz", which was inaugurated last May and which, after traveling through the different provinces of Andalusia, is expected to travel to New York during the International Congress.
The Ministry of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía has also acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diary of a Poet Reciencasado", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America is less pleasant without Paul Newman.
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them".
The line is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "Absent Malice", and it gives an idea of the helplessness of American cinema, and all of America, at the shocking idea that Newman is gone.
Look how hard it was for them to give him an Oscar.
And that he was retired since 2007.
And that he was known to be very ill.
Still, it's been a pain in the ass for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels is beyond all expression, and I have now lost a great friend", lamented Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better because of his existence".
No one was afraid to make a fool of himself or to exaggerate.
A father of cinema and the fatherland had died at a particularly dark time, afraid of terrorists and markets, with American self-esteem at the bottom, desperately looking for reasons for dignity.
When the weather is so harsh and without virtue men and very few beings to admire you have left, you don't have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
She embodied for everyone an almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was Richard Nixon's formal enemy and a champion of lost and gained causes, from the foundation to fight drugs created in honor of his firstborn who died of an overdose to his brand of homemade and organic food.
A gift to a country that has struggled to overcome a suicidal food culture.
The expansive wave of admiration swept Hollywood without regard to nationality or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, found that not a man but an era had died.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was nothing more than the pinnacle of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He has set the bar very high for all of us", said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dares to try to live as Paul Newman did: keeping the demands of probity high and having a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there are those who try, and Paul Newman is their example.
He was divorced once but then married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful when he probably had plenty of opportunities not to be.
"But why am I going to eat hamburger outside, if I have steak inside?" he used to joke himself.
In heaven, he's proud that on earth his daughters match his fans, which is not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he played, none was more proud than that of a devoted husband, a loving father, a caring grandfather, and a dedicated philanthropist", they say.
The imperfect career of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that the Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I say no!
The perfect race they called it, and in my opinion it's been the worst race by far I've ever been in.
A lot of nonsense, which, of course, if you were to consider it as an evaluation and I were to examine it, would be a very clear suspension.
But let's go by parts and start at the beginning.
The mishaps start with the dorsal pickup, which makes you have to go early.
Which is not bad, but if they're going to make you go, they'll give you everything (including the chip to avoid queues in the race).
No, not at all.
Here you only had to go to pick up the back (first nonsense, go only for that) and (after the pertinent tail), surprise!, there was only size 'S' for the shirt (second nonsense, because I need a size XL)
What world are we living in?
Or is it that because of the crisis they have decided to buy only small T-shirts with less fabric and cheaper?
Well, things like this are a minute compared to race day.
Besides having to go early to pick up the chip, the line is 15 minutes and you have to leave your backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, something incomprehensible for a race where more than 11,000 people are expected.
Then, as expected, the race started and we hadn't yet left the backpack, although once we got it, the pick-up was worse.
In addition, the rain has eased the wait of more than 40 minutes, which was joined by conatos of popular rebellion and assault on the house.
I think about 500 people will probably have pneumonia tomorrow, and some like me, won't even show up with the right time in the standings, because of the chip that they gave me that, I guess, didn't mark the exit correctly.
Of course, if I were asked about the perfect career, this one wouldn't enter my mind.
So I think we'll keep dreaming of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the MIT Emerging Technologies conference Microsoft has shown a breakthrough of a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of Artificial Intelligence without much intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in Microsoft's case, a shuttle to move around the company campus) attending to what he hears in conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a face-recognition system, this "receptionist" can know how many people are in the room, who they are - even remember what they are wearing - and listen and understand the key words of their conversations.
Also group the attendees by conversation groups.
In the sample video, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that he does not belong to the group she is talking to and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks if she's there to visit someone and tells her that she'll be there soon.
All without a blue screen.
That's very impressive.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, like the next version of their operating system, Windows.
There's been a lot of talk this week about a change in strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if computers came with essentials instead of commercial garbage bags, they'd go five times faster -- man, Steve, it's gonna be for less.
A find, considering that Microsoft, version after version, has added features and "extras" to Windows.
The change of course is appreciated.
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing importance, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome came online, I was one of those who joined the theory that it was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential layer for the Hardware and the Software to understand each other.
You play the same role as your wife or husband when you have to tell your mother-in-law something.
That's right, I did.
It will never go away but you have to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but relative.
What Ballmer has said this week is confirmation of this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system, and more to the web browser.
The computer starts just to run Firefox or Explorer -- or Chrome -- and every day we spend more time browsing than in the windows environment.
What are half the applications coming into the system for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services and finally making them an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I'll give you a small example.
This photo of this post was taken in one of the Microsoft employee lounges in Redmond earlier this month.
At the soda machine, a sign asks you to use your search tool - "Your quest. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the web.
Last week, by the way, a delay was also confirmed in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It won't arrive in early 2009 but late, rather pulling in 2010.
Microsoft is probably looking for the joint launch of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is more and more computer.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the street, is going to pay off.
The Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick's 'Diamond in Blood', the same as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' and it's part of the uniform of the muscular gay parish.
And if we start listing star appearances, we can go back to the image of that forked, pointy mustache lifting weights in a walking circus.
In essence, it's nothing more than the typical men's cotton undershirt, strapped and sleeveless.
The 'tank', as the English speakers call it, but the Fabulous Marcel de Bruxelles stands out above all the others.
First, by her rambling name - though familiarly known as 'Marcel' - which has to do with sport because it is named, according to legend, after the boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' stands out from the rest for its excellent cotton, its unisex cut, its distinctive shield and the small Belgian flag (barely recognizable) that the most emblematic T-shirt models wear as a detail on the neck.
And, because the production of the Belgian firm is not only focused on its tank tops.
It also includes college sweaters, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, navy T-shirts, babies, mini shorts...
Clothes designed for comfort underwear.
It's a shame to leave them as underwear, though.
They're too charming.
"I want to be a young mother; the candidate doesn't worry me"
His huge resemblance to his sister has not prevented him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is tiny but full of vitality.
Currently the Cruz sisters are taking their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Monica, they're so much more than just some pretty, famous girls who lend their name.
He has been in Paris for the promotion that the firm Mango does in its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Warm and shy, she wins the short distances.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I'm here to present the new collection that my sister Penélope and I have designed for Mango in this new autumn-winter season, in addition to attending the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Come on, a very intense day but, at the same time, exciting.
What is your new collection for Mango based on in this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
My sister and I both love movies from the 1950's and 1960's, and we draw many references from them.
Then I really like to get lost in a city and watch women dress up, how they combine and mix their clothes, I do that a lot.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very multifaceted woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, everything comes together and they have a lot of bonds in common.
I had always liked clothes; I longed to go to my grandmother's house to look through my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to take care of how I dressed.
You know, dancers like to do our own styles for classes and rehearsals, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress when you get the costume is when you really meet the character.
So, it all comes together, yes, with a lot of respect for designers and professionalism.
You're not too old to be 30. Have you had a breakdown?
What's up.
I feel better than ever. I like 30.
I find that women are made, have experience and enjoy life with fewer mistakes.
I'm not scared of the biological clock.
I've done the things I wanted to do since I was a little girl and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, are you thinking about being a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because my body asks me to be one, and I want to be a young mother; I don't want to miss it.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
What I'm going to do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
As for the movies, you're looking at several releases you shot last year.
I am, and I can't wait for them to see the light.
I, who am a woman who comes from the theater, I am very impatient and restless, I want everything for now and of course, it can't be.
I can't wait for the premiere of The Last Hour and In Search of the Tomb of Christ.
Let's see what you think.
You made your debut on a runway with Naomi Campbell a few days ago, right?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not like I'm going up a runway to model.
I was just called by Naomi Campbell, who I've known for a long time, to invite me to go to London to participate in a charity parade for her organization 'Women for a Better World,' and the clothes that we exhibited -- I took two pieces from our collection for Mango -- were auctioned to raise money for Naomi's NGO.
People don't know that tender heart of Naomi.
There's so much that's been said about her that I, who know her, would tell you that a lot of it isn't true.
Besides, I get that good part where she gets involved.
He asked me to march for such a noble cause, but if he ever asks me to do the pine, so be it.
For the benefit of third world women, whatever it takes.
Recurrent drivers due to alcoholism must install the 'alcolock'
Interior wants the driver with three administrative penalties for alcoholism, to have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents the vehicle from starting drunk, or if it does not blow.
The initiative was announced last June and is now included in the annual report of the Attorney General's Office, which states that it is a pilot project that will last for one year.
The purpose of the training is to reintegrate the driver, so that he or she will also receive a course in road re-education.
The experience will be supported by the General Traffic Directorate (DGT) and the Automobile Safety Technological Institute (FITSA) Foundation, in addition to the General Prosecutor's Office for Road Safety.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75 percent of motorists who are reported more than once for drunk driving take the car again.
The alcolock would prevent it as it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in exhaled air and prevents starting the car if the driver does not blow abts; or when a concentration of alcohol is detected is higher than the permitted.
The cost is over 1,000 euros and would be paid by the sanctioned person.
In this respect, a study carried out in the USA in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce infringements by up to 65% during the first year of implementation.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save 115 lives every year.
The measure is aimed at administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address such behaviour before it becomes a criminal offence.
And to facilitate its implementation, since the legal reform can be done by ordinary means, and, however, the necessary reform by the penal way requires a reform in an organic law.
The device is not yet commercially available on the Spanish market, although it has already been implemented experimentally in some industrial and public service vehicles.
The European Parliament has already adopted a resolution on the situation in the Middle East, which is a major step forward in the fight against terrorism.
In Mexico and no peep-toes
With British punctuality, at 17.40, the time scheduled in the program, landed in the presidential Hangar of the airport Benito Juárez de México DF the plane of the Spanish air force in which the Princes of Asturias traveled.
The sun was retreating but its rays still forced the use of the hand as a visor to watch the royal couple descend from the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other officials.
Hours earlier, I had asked the taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish princes were visiting the city to formalize an official trip.
- Oh, very good, then you can't go to the airport to load at that time... she's from here or something...
- No, no sir, she's Spanish but she lived here a couple of years.
- Oh, that's very good.
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and the importance of the trip.
Many are waiting in the airport hangar glued to the red carpet and a military fence made up of 27 Marines who perform the salute of honor.
The Prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the Princess, is bleached to the wind, very sober, does not use her usual 'peep-toes', perhaps they had communicated that in the DF threatened storm.
They give a smile and a quick stop to the photographers before moving on to the room where the official party is waiting.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest in the city, a Mexican television reporter is waiting for them.
The best gifted fashion award
There is possibly no place in the world more appropriate to present a fashion award, than Paris and there is possibly no designer alive more exquisite and bont live than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to boost the international projection of new fashion talents.
It is endowed with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, was looking at her designs in the Mango shop at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried with emotion.
By the way, it's the second largest store in Europe and it just opened with 1,335 square meters of floor space.
The first one is in London.
So many events, coupled with a desire to thank designer Valentino for presiding over the competition's jury, led to a lavish dinner at the Opéra Garnier in Paris.
With the presence of the finest Chagals, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango looked even more spectacular.
Nati, heartbroken and heart-throbbing over the recent death of her brother, put on a suit from the House and some breath-taking props from ELAH, and from her son Luis' arm - a cannon almost two meters long - accompanied Valentino in the chairmanship of his tribute dinner.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, was doing the honors and is so gentlemanly that he ended up, next to the Baron of Rotchil, without a jacket, because both had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who went to the store in pants and a shirt - of her own design - and for dinner she transformed herself into a long sexy black dress, was thrilled when on the night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the ballet rehearsal room and she, remembering other times, grabbed one of the bars and made a big plie.
Inés Sastre did not stay on the promenade through the palace's premises, but before she showed us on the mobile phone photos of her son.
The next morning we were able to enjoy the sight of Olivier Martinez - another motorcycle-riding cannon - and John Travolta, who arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris with his sheets, towels and having asked in advance that there be no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, there, that's life.
1001, the stress-free number.
There are not 1000 but 1000 more ways to forget the chaotic and frenetic everyday life.
And as if that wasn't enough, they're all gathered in a book that will bring relaxation to bookstores on September 30th.
The alarm clock almost punishes when it rings every morning at 7 a.m., but it is even worse to imagine yourself caught up in the hectic pace of modern life.
The office is called tension and the computer is called back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there is no one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and disconnection problems from the world of work.
No, the number amounts to, nothing more and nothing less, than 1001.
Apart from yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of possibilities adapted to the taste and minutes of each person.
The work is called "1001 Ways to Relax", and its calm will be brought to bookstores by Pearson Alhambra and DK Publishing.
If someone feels that it is not possible to achieve peace of mind in such areas as work or through personal relationships, this 'handbook' refutes that belief.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as being in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline is no longer running through your veins to restore balance to your body and stress has become a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, turn off your mind and concentrate on reading.
Talking in your sleep
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean these kids who wake up very smart telling us something that happened the day before, but kids who talk while they're asleep.
The first time it happens, you might get a little scared, but it doesn't really matter.
It's a benign sleep disorder called somnolence.
It's quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one person has heard that he spoke at night.
This phenomenon may occur very sporadically (once in life, for example, associated with an episode of high fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There is no single cause that determines its occurrence.
They are often related to other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night terrors, night enuresis (sleeping) or sleepwalking, but this need not be the case.
As we have already mentioned, they can also be associated with periods of very high fever, stress or overexcitation.
It's a little studied phenomenon anyway.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
He may speak in a calm tone, loose words, a murmur, or the opposite (screams, cries, long speeches, etc.).
In cases where the manifestation is very intense, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist, to see if there is any issue that is generating much anxiety and giving rise to it in this way.
We have said that it is a benign disorder, so it has no treatment, unless it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with sleep apnea or a stress picture).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child too much before bed.
So seek quiet games and avoid TV shows or series that are frightening or a little violent.
With children who are very nervous and have a hard time relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them to acquire a measure of inner calm.
This will help the child to sleep more peacefully.
Once the sleepwalking occurs try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember anything that has happened.
Helpful Tips
Don't wake him up.
It's useless, because he's unconscious, and you'll break his sleep.
Even though he's talking, he's sleeping and therefore resting.
Remember, if he is very distressed for several episodes, you might want to consult or find out what is causing the child so much anxiety.
If you understand what he is saying (which is not the norm), do not be tempted to ask him questions to get information.
You'll get nothing, because as you sleep you're not conscious enough to organize your thoughts.
You will also hear what he says, but you do not know what he is dreaming to say that, so be very careful in how you interpret the information and with the conclusions you draw.
Never tell a child you can interrogate him at night to find out his secrets.
Not even a joke.
That creates a lot of anxiety.
In short, don't worry, it's not bad, it's an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern at last!
The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found the way to victory on their field after a long period of scarcity.
Without having played a good match, the team created many goalscoring opportunities and was able to score a goal to win the match.
The pace was not very steady during this encounter in which the attackers had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann who was rubbing the squad with a shot from a distance, Illhaeusern was almost going to take the "power" and by turn Fonderflick from a distance, then with Hirn up, Romain with the tip of the foot or also Diebold came to prevent the defense of Dannemarie.
In front, we didn't let the midfielder through and left only Riahi in the attacking position.
The start of the second half was crucial, first with two chances of goals from Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousiens with the goal from Marais, well placed to pick up the ball rejected in a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But Illhousiens' goalkeeper won't be able to savor his happiness for long and will be forced back into the wardrobe a dozen minutes later, leaving his teammates outnumbered.
But Dannemarie will not take advantage of the opportunity and will not be a problem for the eleven illhousiens who backed off a bit to "compress" their defense, except in the last seconds of play during which, after an important farfurl, the ball passed very close to the cross-country.
Sarkozy finds the fishermen furious
Before taking off for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a tour of Britain.
In view of the demonstration of resistance by the fishermen who on Monday strongly disturbed the entrances to several Breton and Norman ports, the President of the Republic decided to go on Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, to meet their representatives there.
They promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope that he will "come with concrete proposals".
This presidential visit coincides with the general meeting of the "crisis committee" set up by the Breton fishermen to take action against the rise in the price of diesel, which has reached a record 1.14 euros per litre.
According to Elysée spokesman David Martinon, the President "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies to become competitive again and to save the conditions of employment and remuneration of seafarers".
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy to stand firm.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out operations to reduce traffic in Morbihan and Calvados, which have caused traffic jams of almost 10 km.
The Quiberon marina has also been blocked, but connections to Belle-île have not been stopped.
A "filter barrier" has been placed on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors showed their determination on Monday by burning, at dawn, tires and wooden pallets in front of the fuel depots at the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Les Sables d'Olonne, Vandea, where the bous stayed in port, or Le Havre, where about twenty ships blocked the movements of the merchant ships.
Fishermen from La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique region, stopped blocking the important Total refinery in Donges in the afternoon.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until the meeting this Wednesday at the ministry to think about possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the crisis committee will have to think on Tuesday about the development of the movement and its participation in the meeting planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the national fisheries committee, which did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen did not give up" and "they do not want to move to Paris", announced for example Liliane Cariou, the president of the Lorient fisheries committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but consider that the financial equilibrium of a ship can be reached only with diesel at a price of less than 0.30 euros per litre.
The great Paul Newman
The unforgettable performer of "Two Men and a Fate" has died of cancer, aged 83, at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and also Sam Mendes greeted the film legend and committed actor, Paul Newman, who has died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft company has 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession weighing on the world economy.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, Embraer, maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, Embraer President Fredrico Fleury Curado reaffirmed.
During the first half of the year, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer relies heavily on the Chinese market particularly for selling planes ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG intends to sell more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which has been rescued from trouble by the American monetary authorities, intends to sell more than 15 percent of its assets in order to repay its $85 billion loan, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is willing to consider selling most of its services beyond its international life insurance and its retirement insurance in the United States, the newspaper notes.
The board of directors of AIG met last Sunday afternoon to examine possible sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets from which AIG intends to separate include its air leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in insurer Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, adds the Financial Times.
No final decision has been made on these sales, the Financial Times continues.
AIG must quickly raise liquidity to repay its $85 billion loan from the Federal Reserve at the risk of the US authorities taking 80% of its capital, diluting it to the right proportion of current shareholders.
Analysis of the historic session of the Paris stock exchange
The New York Stock Exchange charged a historic drop last Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson plan to save the banks: the Dow Jones dropped 6.98%, a loss never seen on the stock exchange of almost 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell from 777.68 to 10,365.45 points.
In terms of points, the biggest drop in its history (684.81 points) had been recorded in the past on 17 September 2001, the day on which trading resumed after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq index, the dominant technology index, fell 199.61 points to 1,983.73 units and the Standard & Poor's 500 index, which was widened by 8.81 % (i.e. 106.85 points), to 1,106.55 units, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed by the crisis at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the plan to save the banks that would have allowed to recover some stability in the markets.
With 228 votes to 205, the representatives denied US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he requested.
About two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
"That's not a good signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan", said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"This shows how much the market relied on this plan", added Lindsey Piegza, fearing that a draft adopted within several days would come "too late".
"If the project is really dying . . . the Fed and other central banks will quickly take over (the American central bank, the N. of the Network) to manage the crisis, which would further tighten credit conditions", warned Brian Bethune, head of Economics and Finance at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, "every day a financial institution is announced to be failing" in the United States, Ms Piegza stressed.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual last Friday, authorities arranged for the purchase of Wachovia's banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis accelerated dramatically, prompting emergency interventions for banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, showing that markets are facing "not just a crisis in the US but a global crisis", added FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market went up dramatically.
The yield on the 10-year treasury bond fell by 3,632%, compared with 3,827% on Friday afternoon, and the 30-year bond by 4,161%, compared with 4,357% the day before.
Obama, winner during the first televised duel
The first debate Friday between the two candidates at the White House was another one to see who won between John McCain and Barack Obama.
Not surprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this televised duel that has been watched by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, though honorable, was not "brilliant enough" to allow him to curb his drop in the polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion poll released last Saturday gives Obama a five-point lead (49% vs. 44% for McCain), judges that it is the Democrat who did well.
Among the undecided voters, who are the ones that count, Obama came out victorious with 39% of the respondents, while 25% of them conceded victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama could confirm his lead on Thursday with the expected performance of his fellow candidate, Jose Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
He has good instincts", Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The 70-year-old McCain brought to light his unquestionable experience in foreign policy, underlining the "naivety" of his adversary on these issues that were at the heart of this first round.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that"... he accused several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president", he added.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in Republican television commercials.
Obama stressed that he represented the future.
Without being puzzled, he was concise and precise.
It enhanced his ability to make good decisions, and to restore America's image in the world.
"McCain hasn't understood yet, while Obama has", replied a Democratic television commercial this weekend that reproached the Republican for not considering the importance of the crisis's impact on Americans.
"During the 90 minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you", Obama said yesterday, before 20,000 people who had gathered for an election rally in North Carolina in pouring rain.
He didn't say the words "middle class" or "workers". "The financial defeat clearly favors Obama, who is considered by Americans to be the most capable character to save the economy that is on the brink of collapse.
"The next week could be a decisive one", said the influential Democrat Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the Democratic candidate, the current financial disaster "is the final consequence of eight years of bad economic policy put in place by George Bush and sustained by Senator McCain".
Reaffirming that he would still reduce taxes for 95 percent of Americans despite the Wall Street shocks, the Illinois senator also noted that achieving the country's eventual energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy was his first priority, with the creation of a safety and health system.
McCain wants to build a fleet of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates, being prudent, dodged questions about the 700 billion dollar (470 billion euros) financial bailout plan passed yesterday afternoon by Congress and extremely unpopular.
"In Minsk, have you noticed the elections in Minsk?"
Youth and opponents demonstrated on Sunday afternoon in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the legislative results in advance.
Some hundreds of Belarusians gathered on Sunday afternoon since polling stations were closed in the central square of Minsk to protest the fraudulent nature of the legislative elections.
While no results had yet been announced, numerous young people had come to demonstrate against the power of President Alexandre Lukashenko: "The dictator, he has to resign".
Some admit to not having voted: "Why, they'll do what they want with my vote", says one young man.
They do not believe that the regime which has been giving foreign observers a good look in order to renew contact with the European Union is ready to effect democratic change.
The sanctions, which include a visa ban on 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if the elections are considered fair by observers.
Not according to the opposition.
"We have been placed next to the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the counting of votes", lamented Iouri Potemkine, the spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous regrouping of twelve parties.
"It's a cosmetic change", says Alexandre Milinkievitch, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, because what matters is who counts the votes, and in our house, it's the executive.
If some opposition MPs enter parliament, it is because they have been appointed but not elected.
"But his entry into parliament may mean television appearances, meetings in the regions and bills".
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because 'dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which has a lot of debt to Russia, goes into crisis, and if we don't reform, we run the risk of becoming a Russian protectorate.
But we want to be independent".
The opposition fears that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which followed the electoral process, will not recognize the validity of the vote.
He stressed that the turnout figures appeared too high and that the widespread early voting (26 per cent of voters in Minsk) favored manipulation.
"Have you noticed the elections?" he asks the Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one at the polls.
And there will be no more than five opposition MPs in parliament, those who are best suited to power".
The silence of the night returns again in the October Square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
The interview - Blood is safe again
Héma-Québec celebrated its 10th anniversary yesterday, and its president, Francine Décary, had reason to rejoice, because Héma-Québec has once again become one of the safest and most efficient blood suppliers in the world.
And most of all, it regained the public's trust that had been seriously shaken by the contaminated blood scandal of the 1980s and 1990s.
As is well known, the national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and the hepatitis C virus during the 1980's.
In the face of this tragedy and public discontent, the government of Canada conducted a public survey in February 1994, chaired by Justice Horace Krever, to clarify the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations to prevent such a disaster from happening again.
While Judge Krever was slow to present his report, certain provinces then set up a committee whose goal was to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee fulfilled this mission.
As a result of the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Héma-Québec to supply Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and both territories.
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec started its operations, almost 38 percent of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec", recalls Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
After making many efforts to improve the safety of blood products and much work over the years that followed, we have regained the public's trust", he says before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the Quebec population had subsequently trusted Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary, however, reminds us that "trust is extremely fragile".
Since its creation on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, we saw the birth of numerous cases of the human variant of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, in Europe, says Décary.
And we didn't know if this disease could be transmitted through blood.
So we have taken one of the main recommendations from the Krever and Gélineau reports, which is that when we do not know and when a serious disease may result from it, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain which inevitably leads to death, we introduce exclusion measures.
In April 1999, we refused blood from people who had stayed in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
But some years ago it was proved beyond doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode showed us that the precautionary principle that was applied made sense".
In 1999 a much more sensitive HIV detection technique appeared on the market: nucleic acid tests that detect the presence of the virus directly in the blood of donors and not antibodies to the virus, which were the basis for the tests used until now.
Nucleic acid tests shortened the time between the time the person was infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
We were able to reduce this period to less than a week.
We're significantly reducing the risk that certain donors are unknowingly infected and unable to be detected.
These improvements significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS from blood transfusions.
Today, one person in 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
"That means 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before anyone is infected with HIV.
So since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will be over 24 years before a case of HIV transmission by a blood product occurs.
I believe that today one can receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to regain health without worries", says the head of Héma-Québec's management.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know what pathogen might emerge in the system.
Last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on Reunion Island. Like the West Nile virus, it is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We must be constantly vigilant", continues Dr Décary before stressing that in addition to a secure supply, Héma-Québec must also provide for a sufficient supply.
"Needs increase as the population ages.
Since the most aggressive anti-cancer treatments, patients often need an injection of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also has consequences for the blood donor network, which on average comprises only 3% of Quebecers eligible to donate blood.
All persons in good health, aged 18 and over who meet the eligibility criteria may nevertheless donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14 per cent of people who offer their blood are not accepted, because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled to a country where malaria is prevalent, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"With this 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory that covers the needs of hospitals.
Hardships are very rare.
But members of this donor network need to be renewed as they age and can no longer donate their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but more importantly to retain them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Since life is so unbridled today, we rarely find time to spend an hour donating your blood", laments Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products but also human tissue, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for major burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered biomedical waste is filled with a blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases like leukemia.
"We celebrated a few weeks ago, the placement in the bank of our thousandth umbilical cord blood sample and it is expected to take more than a thousand of these per year.
We should start proposing it for grafts early next year", says Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood collection program as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot enjoy this", since Héma-Québec does not have the resources to propose this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Softball - The Impact in the Semifinals
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semifinals of the USL First Division playoffs with a 3-1 (4-3 in the end) win over the Seattle Sounders yesterday in the second and deciding game of the quarterfinals at Saputo Stadium.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After the first half without a goal from either side, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino created many chances for goals.
Roger Levesque was the only one who knocked Matt Jordan out for the Sounders.
Recall that during the first game of the round-robin series, on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 loss at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will be measured against the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
Saturday afternoon at Minnesota, the Thunder lost 3-1 in the rematch to take it 4-3, but the Whitecaps still advanced in the semifinals 5-4.
The Impact should face the Whitecaps next Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In short  Kovalev's winning goal
The Canadian's number one trio is ready to kick off the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn cheered the attack in a 3-2 win by the Canadian to the free-throw barrier against the Florida Panthers, yesterday night, at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec accumulated two assists, and Kovalev collected a pass in this win, the Tricolor's fourth in six preliminary matches.
Kovalev scored the only goal to win.
"I'm not ready yet", warned the Russian.
"I need another game to feel comfortable".
He tried to play his best in the first half, Guido Carbonneau scored.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He got a nice standing ovation".
Charest is in charge of the North.
Prime Minister does not rule out launching elections before the end of the year
As soon as the Liberal Party's general council is over, Jean Charest went yesterday to Juan-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to get elected during today's by-election.
To reject the limits of our last great northern frontier: this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force, remaining on the outlines at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Lévis yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, images were projected.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec as seen by "Google Maps", maps, and so on, were displayed.
Big media like during the election period.
The Prime Minister thinks the elections will take place this autumn, although he made it clear that his schedule was very busy.
The "Northern Plan" is the fourth part of a "vision" the Prime Minister intends to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a labour agreement with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmonies with Ontario.
Often mentioned in recent Prime Minister speeches, the opening of the North - the territory north of the 49th parallel - has never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister however limited himself to explaining why the North was "a jewel of immense potential", but did not give a term, investment amounts, or precise priority in future projects.
The most developed sectors are: hydroelectricity, forestry, but above all the mining sector, which is being helped by the growth of the emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond", according to Mr Charest's listing.
This territory, twice the size of France, is our home, it's in Quebec.
It is not only our home, but it is in us", he insisted, as if to show that he was asking for a national founding myth.
Quebec was built largely by its relationship with the North, he stressed: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It belongs to us, it is our future", he added, after taking a theatrical pause to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70 per cent of Quebec's territory, comprises a part of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister said during the press conference.
"It is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a line of demarcation on which they have not agreed for a long time and, when the opportunity presents itself, I reiterate that position on the part of the government", he said.
In addition, "with climate change, we have to rethink our vision of the North", he said, referring to the Northwest Passage, which will open every year due to the melting of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers occupying the territory a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former deputy of the Ungava party in Quebec), have already started consultations in about 30 communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role has started some work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out an important meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a meeting in which "a common vision will be given".
The development of the North would be carried out in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan "will be concerted, orderly and respectful of the environment", he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as one that is in continuity with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
"Like the liberals before us, we have thought differently to transform challenges into new opportunities for growth and development".
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a big cocktail to mark the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's rise to party power.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes renaming the Beauharnois Central into the Adélard-Godbout Reservoir.
" From Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, to Lesage who made the Quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Bourassa who made James Bay our party knew how to forge the future ", declared Juan Charest.
At the press conference, he invoked another reference, the conservative one, the "Roads to the North" programme of John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
On the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Mr Charest stressed that it is scheduled to be commissioned in 2012.
"This stays between us, but I plan to be there", he told his militants, eliciting applause.
Indeed, the prime minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of launching a vote this autumn, which the law allows.
It stresses that its schedule is nevertheless full, particularly because of a Federation Council mission to China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend general council provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly "constitutional aspirations" that had no problem being accepted: the Quebec Liberal Party in particular demands recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and to give them a veto over decisions taken in Quebec.
On the opposition side, we welcome the broad lines of the Northern Plan with skepticism.
The head of the Quebec party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, coming to power in 2003, gave up applying it.
If she had done so, 'we would have made progress today', said Mrs Marois, alongside her Jean-Talon candidate (voted today), Françoise Mercure.
Democratic Action of Quebec seemed to support the government's adoption of a Northern Plan.
"But what we want is for this not to be just a show", said leader Sebastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who is returning from holiday today.
Lyrics - A country dishonored
It is Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (oh, irony!) in the Harper cabinet, who dared last summer to say that Luisa Arbour was a "shame" to Canada.
To thus dishonor this woman who has led a relentless fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration which says all about the Prime Minister's relationship with Stephen Harper.
We are facing a government which is the only one of all the Western countries involved that has not repatriated its national who is being held in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
It is a government that in no way takes into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the incidents he is accused of occurred.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, reneges on its promise and lets a child soldier live in inhumane conditions.
The only one who uses a false justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
We should recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association in particular support the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that he can enjoy the benefit of a fair trial in Canada.
It is this government that turns a blind eye to torture: it cares little that a young adult is psychologically destroyed, certainly forever after so many years of torture.
We do not yet realize it, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', that is the word Harper keeps repeating and which makes no sense.
The time has come when there is no more morality: we can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen as the head of the government, hitherto a minority, wishes (what will happen after October 14 ?).
Many voters believe they will find salvation in a party that praises Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what was doing the reputation and dignity of our country.
Mr Toews, the shame is caused by this resignation and nothing else.
Free opinion - The Orwellian speech by Barrick Gold
In its September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice president and director of Canadian miner Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold claims that the world's largest gold company tried a six million euro defamation suit against three authors and a small publishing house in order to provoke a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of prosecutions for defamation, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to harm anyone who dares to hold a position contrary to his own?
The outcome of the case is of little importance, the authors and the publisher of Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums in order to prepare their defence and fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of the miner.
The tactic, in these unequal fights, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly settlement that will muzzle the opposition as well as scare anyone who dares to reexamine the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it's in front of the public opinion that he would have had to present his view of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in several of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are usually about changing ideas and not about sticks.
It was therefore sufficient for the miner to open his books, his files and to establish a real debate, through the newspapers, the media, publications and the funding of independent research teams that could have clarified the matter.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and is rejecting petitions and letters of support for Noir Canada authors.
Could Mr Garver possibly explain how he can call for a "public" debate while disregarding the views of the public?
According to the Vice-President, it seems that this word refers only to high-paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; that represents a very limited view of the concept.
In a democracy, detractors also have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - is that the public that supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada does so primarily because they reject the brutal way the mining is done.
This audience is willing to listen to Barrick and judge him, but on the basis of civilized arguments, and not in the context of what many people perceive as a "bite-push" (following the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just filed a request with respect to the authors of Noir Canada urging them not to use this word anymore).
In addition to Mr Garver's surreal speech, the Barrick Gold trial is a direct attack on the freedom of academic inquiry and the freedom to seek the truth, which are essential to all democratic societies.
It denies the right to cite credible sources and to debate the facts and interpretations that form the basis of the intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that displease the rich corporations of this world in a country like Canada, under penalty of many persecutions, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have a right to a reply.
The university world, to which we belong, has long known how to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
The excessive persecution of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, contrary to what it claims, it is not keen to have a transparent debate.
It's a loss for the academic world, but also for the public debate in Canada, and it's time for governments to put in place devices that limit this kind of abusive persecution.
Wall Street bailout - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republican and Democratic, finally reached agreement yesterday on the most important economic bailout plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to stem the financial crisis that has been rocking Wall Street for months still needs to be confirmed by both houses of Congress.
It provides in particular for better control by the elected representatives of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money invested, new provisions to contain the number of foreclosed houses and non-payment, and a tax on the salaries paid to the managers of the firms receiving aid.
The US Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a two-day marathon of negotiations.
"We are making great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets", said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done to cover up the economy and ordinary Americans in the current crisis on Wall Street", the Democrat explained.
"It's the bottom line: if we don't do this, the trauma, chaos and disruption to the daily lives of Americans will be immense", Republican Judd Gregg declared.
The negotiations had been concluded very quickly in the last few hours because they feared the effect of a new failure on the investor mood.
The last time they had set was for the markets to open this morning.
The two candidates in the American presidential elections, who have joined the negotiations late, were rather in favour of the agreement, without forgetting to express their dissatisfaction at having to go to this extreme.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama was given certain provisions to reach the agreement, particularly the one that would allow homeowners to keep their homes and the one about the salary of the heads of the surviving companies by the state.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, we should not be congratulated.
But these measures are necessary", he said on American television.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, asked on another network if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied that "I'd like to see the details, but I hope to vote for it".
"The important points I read [shows] that it is something that we will have to digest and with which we can move forward.
He said the option of doing nothing is not acceptable".
The 700 billion plan is to buy with taxpayers' money the dubious debts, risky assets and untradable assets of American financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the bursting of a housing bubble that first led to the collapse of risky mortgages before spreading to other more common forms of credit securities (CCBS) and causing a liquidity freeze and a run-down of banks and financial institutions.
It's a group of Republican elected officials who had the first draft of the agreement changed last week.
We think we've come out of the stalemate since the Democrats agreed that certain "toxic" assets of struggling companies should only be insured by the government, rather than bought.
In order to settle the rough patches for everyone in Congress, we also added a provision that if the government had to take losses for five years with this program, it could impose new fees that would purportedly help it recover money.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first part of 250 billion, to which 100 billion may be added if the President deems it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote by Congress.
In return for his help, Washington will get stakes in the rescued companies that will pay dividends on profits and that it can sell back when the storm is over.
The Federal Government will have the possibility to delay foreclosure proceedings concerning housing obtained with real estate loans under this plan, as well as to set limits on remuneration and on cash compensation paid to the managers of companies affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see it submitted to the House of Representatives vote today and to the Senate next Wednesday.
Despite all his efforts, he's still not sure that his plan will be approved.
Some people continued to protest yesterday against this bill, both from the Republicans and Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told his constituents that "with all the evidence, Washington doesn't want to understand".
"We have a very serious financial problem.
There are solutions.
But not the one that involves taking advantage of the taxpayers".
Democratic Representative Brad Sherman, who is a small-group cheerleader in Congress, presents the issues in a different way, but he comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, wrote to us to say: we ask the Congress not to rush and to examine carefully the path to take", he declared yesterday.
At this very moment, in Europe, we had again proof of the global nature of the crisis.
After an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion dollars).
The intervention of the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was renouncing its bid to buy its bankrupt competitor since it lost €2 billion ($2.9 billion) during the risky mortgage crisis in the United States.
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is one of the 20 largest European banks and 10 largest insurers.
"This is not wasted money", said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
Instead, we regain a vote in the bank and influence.
It is just something that savers and families will appreciate now that times are uncertain".
Meanwhile, across the Channel, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank suffering from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all outstanding loans at Bradford and Bringley Bank and more than 41 billion euros ($75.5 billion) in real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would be the one to buy the branches and bank accounts of the British bank.
The Bradford and Bringley bank would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
His blue eyes have long represented his triumph.
Had the American actor with a charming smile freed himself from his narcissistic side?
Yes and no.
His modesty, his sensitivity and a talent that was evident must have also kept him from the power register of the true sacred monsters.
But what a great long-distance runner!
Paul Newman, who died Friday at the age of 83 from lung cancer at his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the '50s.
He is less phenomenal than Brando, to whom he was very similar and who was long considered a rival in cinema, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the bursting of dramatic conventions.
Mixed-bloods often make great children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
No over-ego, the ultimate mark of quality.
Because it projected an entire country in love with the self-made man, the combat wounded Pacific war fighter, who in the early '50s studied drama at Yale, then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before succeeding in theater, television and soon in film.
This man who fought for civil rights was also the car driver who was ranked second in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1979, dubbed by a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with the actress Joanne Woodward.
With it, the secret sides of this secret, discreet and committed star, allergic to the scandals of the entertainment world that we do not know very well, also disappear.
He's an honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman has sent filmgoers into a vertigo this weekend, as his great roles clash on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of seventh-century American art in perpetual motion parades through it.
Many memories come back as the charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Roof adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we evoke his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that did not keep all its promises.
Others like Paul Newman have gone down in film history.
This Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable boxer in Robert Wise's Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role intended for James Dean, repeated after his death, which really launched Newman in 1956.
This nice guy in the lavish movie The Sting, Oscar for best picture in 1973.
A bitter and vindictive billiards player in Robert Rossen's magnificent film The Hustler (1961), he will reprise the character in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earned him his only Oscar in 1987 out of nine nominations.
This face that changes with age, it was him.
Still him.
Times change during his career.
Young people know him mostly through George Roy Hill's Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans saw him again in 1994 in The Coen Brothers' The Hudsucker Proxy.
With a final role as the godfather of the Irish mob in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003, the curve was curved.
Unlike several film legends who left their careers early, Newman stayed in the film world for a long time, denouncing Hollywood, its glitter, its fashions and its concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, with humor, "a challenge that lives in "underplaying" and judges his performances too supported.
The profession wasn't always easy for the handsome Paul Newman who got the parts for a long time without doing anything.
However, he played less often the role of the young gallant than the marginal: neurotic, alcoholic, asshole or desperate, whose traits reflected the rebellions.
As a filmmaker, Newman revealed sides of his true buddhic sensibility not well known.
His 1968 film Raquel, based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence, with his wife Joanne Woodward in the title role, depicted a melancholy female portrait.
He who lost his son Scott to an overdose dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son, a work of shame and sadness.
"Among the many tributes that were unleashed yesterday for Newman, his great friend and former comrade-in-arms Robert Redford (who had worked together on The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) stated, very sadly, "my life and my country were better because of his existence".
Generosity, love of existence are important traits of the deceased actor.
On the other side of his legendary career, there is also a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent film, a challenger against the excesses of Hollywood.
We have often seen his face reign over the jars of vinegar sauce, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging this method as a bad taste, even though it began as a gag.
The proceeds from these sales were donated to his Foundation for Children in Need.
Newman, rather than settle for his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter that contained these words: "always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there".
And a privilege for us to have followed the career of such a lucid and generous American artist.
In short, a model citizen.
What did they produce at the Zuschlag &amp; Co. bill factory?
Very soon, on October 8, the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of committing fraud of significant damage, in a business manner, continuously and in an organized manner in addition to other crimes, including forgery of documents.
According to the prosecutor, they used for their own purposes the funds obtained in the public tenders, justifying the fulfillment of the tasks with false invoices.
The public and municipal funds - totalling some HUF 65 million - were partly in the treasury of the Fiatal Baloldal organisation and partly in the pocket of private individuals.
The method, which was also disclosed by the investigators, was to justify the collection of the funds obtained in the public tenders with false invoices behind which there was no real execution, the various associations never fulfilled their obligations.
According to the prosecution, most of the bills were false.
To do this, they obtained the talonaries from the market in Józsefváros District and the circular seals were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas.
The question of which company was to issue the counterfeit invoice was decided, among others, during the tour of the Upper Balaton Region, where János Zuschlag sent István Lados.
The latter confessed that for this purpose he had to choose hostels and restaurants.
He asked for a bill for his consumption and these served as a model for making the bills he presented among others in the contests of the Ministry of Juvenile and Sports Affairs, in the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor, as well as in the City Hall of the Capital.
These bills were signed mostly by István Lados and his accomplice András Őri, who according to our information rather wrote the reports necessary to obtain the public subsidies.
During one of his "study trips" Lados chose a brewery.
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and his accomplices, this food centre provided food for a group of ninety people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However - according to the centre manager - so many people cannot fit in at the same time.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb Jövőért Foundation - later called Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért - was full of formal and contextual errors.
A hostel in the town of Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and no more than ten people could stay there in one night, yet the bill was for one hundred and thirty people.
But the manufacturers of fantastic invoices also exaggerated when they pointed to the Pigal Kft. gastronomic center because in the bookkeeping of the same - according to the information given to the Fiscal - there were no documents in the name of Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá.
Győző Farkas, the manager of the company, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned by the prosecutor's office and shown the invoices, he already knew that they were fake documents.
"The stamp had our company name and NIF in the wrong place".
He added: besides the formal problems, he did not agree that according to the bill, one hundred people were accommodated, since they have only eleven rooms in which not so many people can fit.
Also, the bill included meals, while the restaurant has been out of business for a while.
The enthusiastic invoice makers were also not informed that the travel agency chosen in Budapest exclusively organises trips abroad, so that in the cash invoice they foolishly indicated as a service a trip within Hungary, which was not in line with the agency's invoice issuing practice either.
In addition - as was found during the investigation - they included VAT in the document as well, even though travel outside the territory of the European Union was exempt from tax.
The VAT measure was also incorrect in the four documents issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Jobb Jövőért foundation, since the services of that company are not charged 25 but only 15 per cent VAT, and the hotel employees only handed out machine-made invoices, although the invoice was handwritten.
In addition, the "shippers" made other mistakes as well, such as in the case of a company in which they put in the invoice as an activity carried out the road transport to which - it was known during the investigations of the prosecutor's office - does not carry out the company founded as investment consultant.
Also due to formal differences - inadequate form of the invoice, false stamp - it was found that the invoices issued for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, for XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and for Biztos Pont are false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives denied having issued those invoices.
The counterfeiters also paid attention to the fact that when the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület ate there (2001) the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in the process of liquidation, so the person in charge of the liquidation process - according to our information - denied having issued such a document.
They sent out the bills consciously
Another group of counterfeiters are those who were aware that they should issue fake invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, issued an invoice worth about HUF four million in the name of the Együtt Foundation to Harmadik Évezredért.
The manager of Collab Kft. - according to the prosecution - was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue fictitious invoices.
Similarly, Biogate Kft., currently in liquidation, cooperated with Zuschlag and its accomplices, which in 2003 supplied invoices worth approximately HUF 5 million to the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület association and the Vörösfenyő Egyesület association, without any real economic activity behind them.
There was no capital movement either, because afterwards they cancelled the bills prepared but forgot to include this entity in their documents.
The next group of counterfeiters include those who have some connection to the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the plaintiff of the Ukrainian manager of the fictitious Budapest-based Delta Trio SL, which dealt in the sale of fuel and vehicles.
This company issued numerous invoices for the sale of computer media worth approximately HUF 18 million in October, November and December 2005.
According to the investigation data, these invoices were purchased by Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The manager of this company was a Romanian, to whom Ivan Kubatov should have also sent the documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices on behalf of the company for the Atlasz, for the Hoppá and for the Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány collecting the amount himself.
Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian masons at the express request of Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies actually worked because - according to the defendant - they did not get work.
But he took advantage of these companies, for at the request of his accomplice, lawyer Zsolt Szente, who prepared the company's registration documents, they issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the organizations linked to Zuschlag: to the Atlasz and to the Y-Generáció.
Kubatov on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade issued a total of 15 invoices to different entities for a value of HUF 14,2 million.
The prosecution considered that Kubatov received VAT and 10% of the invoice amount.
That man even took advantage of the Szi-Beri joint-stock company to issue fictitious bills used in Biztos Pont's contest.
Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted a competition in January 2006 to Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA), a public utility entity of the Socialist Party.
The tender received 500 thousand HUF respectively, but did not use the money for the tender objectives.
To avoid this being discovered, they presented the TMA with five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft.
These were the invoices found during the registration of the office that Árpád Kemecsei had at the headquarters of the Ministry of Education.
Some of the defendants will probably relate at the trial - as they did at the Prosecutor's Office - the course of the counterfeiting of the invoices.
The most interesting thing may be the confession of the main accused János Zuschlag himself, if he decides to dismantle everything.
Well, his confessions so far have not been very detailed and although he repeatedly promised to talk about everything, he hasn't done so until now.
The question is: what is his interest in doing so? For perhaps in return for the return of most of the money - 50 million HUF - the socialists have reached an agreement with him for Zusi to assume all the responsibilities.
Who, on the other hand, for these days even could be offended, since to alleviate his prison conditions he requested house arrest, but was repeatedly denied.
While the numerous perpetrators of far superior economic crimes, who never returned the money, roam freely or at least can wait in their own homes for sentencing, he has no chance of that.
The psychology of overlapping: Why do we spend more money?
Participants in auctions are likely to spend more money and overvalue the product.
Neurologists and economists at New York University discovered the neurological-economic basis for this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to the study in the journal Science, people don't want to lose in competitions like eBay auctions, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
Scientists tried to establish the neurological pattern of this "game" by means of experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lottery, the other participated in an auction, and the active areas of the participants' brains were examined by means of the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) system.
In both games, participants could win money, but during auctions, where it is essential to bet more than the other, losing the game intensified the functioning of the complex called the stratum located under the cerebral cortex.
This area of the brain, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the nervous system's "self-reward" mechanism.
So, according to scientists, the increase in gambling is explained as a prevention to avoid provoking an intense stratum reaction.
To support their theory, the economists in the scientific group also carried out a financial follow-up study.
In this experiment, three groups bet against one person in different circumstances.
The control group was simply told the actual value of the product in question, and their members bet.
Another group was also promised an additional $15 prize if they won.
Instead, the third group received exactly 15 dollars before the auction, but if they lost the auction, the group members lost even that money.
So the only difference between the two groups was that one group highlighted success and the other group highlighted failure.
However, testing the neurologists' hypothesis, members of the "failure" group were willing to gamble even more than members of the control group and the "win" group.
"These results cannot be deduced from any previously existing economic theory.
The Commission has not yet decided on the future of the Community.
Only visual neurological methods helped to resolve this contradiction between the two theories, so we now come to a third explanation", said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at New York University.
Hepatitis: When should you see a doctor?
Worldwide some 500 million people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary chronic liver disease is considered one of the leading causes of death.
The number of infected people in this country is estimated at 100,000, but only 7,000 are receiving treatment because many of the sick do not know they are infected.
Hepatitis is the common name for various liver diseases caused by viruses.
The symptoms are very similar; liver infection and jaundice are characteristic, but their pathogens and the diseases they cause are very different.
Hepatitis viruses dependent on the pathogen are spread in two main ways: hepatitis A and E via food (e.g. contaminated water or food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through blood and body fluids (sperm, vaginal fluid, saliva).
Travellers are advised to be vaccinated against A and B viruses, as there are no vaccines against C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating the infected food, manifesting as general malaise, weakness, abdominal pain, and nausea.
After that jaundice appears on the skin and white of the eyes, the feces become clear, the urine dark and the healing can last up to two - three weeks.
Each year a million people die worldwide from cancer and cirrhosis of the liver caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten infected persons receives drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: untreated, it can lead to liver cirrhosis and even cancer.
Most infected people do not know they are sick because this pathogen gradually destroys liver cells and often the first symptoms do not appear until 20-30 years later.
Therefore, early detection, systematic medical monitoring, is very important.
The disease is much more common in three groups: people who had blood transfusions before 1991, drug users, and those who have tattoos.
There are now some 200 million people in the world who suffer from chronic hepatitis C.
Since this disease can be detected by routine laboratory testing as well, it is worth consulting your family doctor if you experience any unknown symptoms.
The disease has a cure if discovered early, it is possible to exterminate the virus from the body, so that the contagion can be suppressed and cancer prevented.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized in 2004 by organizations representing patients.
It aims to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver infections caused by viruses and to the importance of early detection.
Does it hurt less for those who believe in God?
According to a recent study, religious faith has a calming effect that even eased the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment: They analyzed how religious belief influences human pain, reports Britain's Telegraph newspaper.
In this unique experiment, they electrocuted 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists while all were looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the technique of scanning the human brain, it was verified that the Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain.
This experiment is the first in a series of research projects involving scientists, philosophers and theologians from the University's various departments.
The analysis was done in the following way: A sparkling instrument was attached to the patient's left hand, which applied the electric shock.
The researchers asked the participants to look at two paintings - the 17th-century Virgin Mary by Sassoferrato and the 15th-century Lady of the Armino by Leonardo da Vinci.
The researchers hoped that the Virgin Mary spectacle would evoke a certain religious mood among the faithful, while they chose Leonardo's oil because it was not too different from the other, and they thought it had a calming effect.
Patients spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, receiving 20 electric shocks in four successive parts during that time while observing either the religious-themed painting or the other.
Catholics said that looking at the Virgin Mary made them feel "secure" as "protected" persons, "soothed and peace reigned in their hearts".
When they looked at the religious painting, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they looked at Leonardo's painting.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any image that's so shocking, you can get a similar effect on atheists too, you just have to find the right image.
"We should find a portrait of a person for whom they feel very positive, like a mother or a father", the psychologist said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright celebrated the outcome of the investigation.
"The exercise of faith should and in many cases does change our personality", Wright added.
After these formidable results, there is only one question left: What effect would it have on pain regulation if the faithful were shown the Madonna by Leonardo or another painter of his stature?
Would a high-quality vision of the Virgin Mary produce even better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On its tenth birthday, Google can claim: it can be found in people's pockets as well as in the sky above their heads; it knows where they spent their holidays, which doctors they visit and what interests them.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's executives, this is still not enough.
On the other hand, skeptics who draw a parallel with the Orwellian vision do not see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect as much personal data as possible about its users, and this is necessary to fulfill the original goals of Google's founders: "We bring together all the information in the world in one system!"
According to the head of Google, the company even after ten years of work that revolutionized the world is still in the initial phase of the endeavor to be able to process all the information.
When asked what will happen in five years' time, Schmidt replied: I wish Google could answer questions like "What will I do tomorrow?" or "What would be the best job for me?" - but software cannot answer seemingly simple questions as long as there is not enough information from users.
Not all Internet users are aware that during their browsing on the Web, the keywords they searched for, the IP addresses and the pages they went to at the end of the search are stored accurately.
For example, Personalized Search, which debuted two years ago, allows users to store their own browsing history, they can consult what they were looking for before, what they opened and thanks to this history will generate much more personalized searches - on this same logic will be based the Recommendations, in which the system will offer us products and services based on the preferences previously defined and stored.
What will happen if they use my data against me, if they collect information about my activities? - ask those users who are concerned about seeing Google's information monopoly.
In most cases rather the potential represented by the company is what can be fearful and not remorse, fear of punishment, yearning for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is a confirmed fact that not only do they retain, but in justifiable cases they also transfer to third parties all the expressions sought, in these cases there is nothing to protect the personal rights of internet users.
Perhaps the most debated example of recent times was the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, when Google gave the Brazilian government information from its Web page, called Orkut, to identify pedophiles.
However, Internet users concerned about human rights were relieved in May when the company, along with the EFF, an organization for the defense of electronic rights, successfully proved before the court that it was right in its dispute with the FBI: according to the ruling, Google cannot be forced, by any of the constitution's points, to provide any kind of information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government managed to obtain, under the pretext of strengthening the child protection law passed years ago, some 50,000 web addresses and some 1,000 search phrases, but without obtaining the search lists of individual users, nor complete lists of web pages and keywords for the last two months.)
This is a rather contradictory view of Google: it is criticized by those who are afraid to provide their personal data because they think that their privacy, their private life is damaged by starting to use Google services, and they rebel against it as against multinational companies with a conservative image.
Meanwhile, the North American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, Internet users and users from other countries, see in them the next generation, the "avant-garde corporation", not so their rival, Microsoft, cataloged by its Windows as the conqueror of the World, however much both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google unlike Microsoft, does not ask users for any identification code, nor money for their applications, the code is open and the free software package, constantly updated and seems more youthful, more collaborative than the practice of the official software giant.
But it may also be because geeks see precisely the very problematic relationship between human rights and the Internet that was produced by one of the most mentioned keywords in recent years: Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about collaboration, about leaving intentional footprints behind us and leveraging the available communication channels, and while the measurements of these vary individually, the essence remains the same: showing ourselves.
A normal young person can have a profile on numerous social pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and can even link them to other services, such as Twitter or last.fm which offers a list of his music habits, after which he can include them in a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, he can also have a blog, where the most recent photo galleries that are stored on Flickr or Picasa automatically appear.
We can know numerous cases from which it follows that for example the girlfriend, by seeing the flow of photographs of the next morning of common friends, finds out who her fraudulent boyfriend spent the night with or they can fire the employee of a company because he writes his honest opinion on his blog about the management of the company: one thing is certain, the definition of privacy was completely re-evaluated.
A person's online life is what they show themselves - this is the definition behind the behavior of today's youth.
And anyone who wants to hide something, or at least wants to dodge Google's monopoly, can do it (starting with the Scroogle, for example, which uses Google's search engine, but leaves no trace).
There are many people who don't want to register on the collective pages to avoid being found, but you can replace Google's "online" applications, from text-writing software to image and news-reading applications with alternative versions that don't connect to giant servers or prepare the most perfect profile possible about us.
Public opinion is almost openly waiting for the day when Google shows its true face.
The company with its current value of 156 billion dollars is worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars), AdWords/AdSense advertising surfaces threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, while the services that are introduced more and more quickly cause serious headaches not only for Microsoft, but also for numerous other software development companies.
Critical observers, however, will find the alarming contradictions as well: for example, the top management flatly rejected the protest of employees after doubling the price of the company's childcare, they considered the unlimited number of employees' meals too expensive, but all this is nothing compared to the fact that in 2006 Google gave in to pressure from the Chinese government and the company according to the agreement filtered all information that violated the good morals and interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal regulations says that they will not announce any new services in advance, but only when it is ready to work, which is sure that the predictable problems of the coming months and years may revolutionize the world: while some believe that the scanning and archiving project of books and magazines of Google will acquire such dimensions that the company will soon be cited by the Supreme Court of the United States, others fear their health system, because in it we can create our own complete health profile, with previous analyses, with our doctors and our problems.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database, it could provide a good raw material for science fiction writers. Scroogled, the popular novel by Cory Doctorow, describes in an Orwellian way that future, in which a man only from Google's data can be described alarmingly well.
Two minors helped to erase the fingerprints of the perpetrator of the double murder in the city of Ózd.
Police questioned two minors about Ózd's double murder who, according to suspicion, helped to erase the traces of the crime - said on Tuesday the spokesman of the General Commissariat of Public Order of Borsod province.
The young women admitted the crime they were charged with, and are now accused of being advocates of the crime.
The two minors - according to the Hungarian News Agency, they are two girls - will be able to defend themselves freely.
For complicity, you can get up to 5 years in prison.
The accused of Ózd 's double murder - a 23-year-old man - has been in pre-trial detention since Sunday .
You're charged with the crime of murdering several people premeditated and out of greed.
During the investigation it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum to a 53-year-old man.
The accused did not want to pay his debt, so on Wednesday of last week he summoned his creditor to the headquarters of a company in Ózd, where he killed him and then killed the victim's 9-year-old daughter as well.
According to MTI, the young man had prepared for the crime much earlier, as he committed the murder with a weapon previously hidden at the scene.
The police are using an expert to analyze the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - for 100 percent of the shares in the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange confirmed the offer made by the Poles, even though the Czechs have previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the list of possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
The Polish State holds 99 per cent of the shares and intends to sell 60 per cent of them within a few months.
The Czech business daily E15 reported that the Polish bid was the highest among those offered by those interested in the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have so far made bids.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange, declared last week that among the interested parties the worst new owner would be the Warsaw Stock Exchange and did not rule out the possibility that with this, in the future the Prague Stock Exchange would disappear.
Experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at about 5 to 10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders' agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with a stake of approximately 25 per cent, followed by Banco Ceská Sporitelna with 14.7 per cent and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 per cent.
The financial crisis from the European press' point of view
The main European newspapers in their Tuesday comments on the deepening international financial crisis spoke of a "second 9/11".
The global financial catastrophe is due to the American president - La Repubblica di Roma believes - the president has not been able to even get his own party's support for the hastily made bill, which aims to provide a solution to this desperate situation...
Instead of a new "Pearl Habor", as billionaire investor Warren Buffett spoke, it is more accurate to speak of a "second 9/11".
According to a section of the Madrid press, Washington is the scapegoat.
In El Mundo's view, it was the mistake of the United States' political leadership that brought the world economy to the brink of the abyss.
The danger of the collapse of the American monetary system is growing and this will then have repercussions throughout the world.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, after the congressional vote the danger arises that Washington does not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air - just as one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
This threat cannot be ignored, notes the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states today can still throw a life-belts to faltering financial institutions, thus saving them from bankruptcy with taxpayer money.
But if, like dominoes, more banks collapse, then neither new funds nor new improvisations will be enough.
It is necessary in the long term for the Member States of the European Union to put aside their nationalist selfishness and to centralize control over the fragmented financial markets.
The financial institutions in crisis received more than 100 billion euros on Monday alone, the Viennese newspaper Der Standard recalls, adding that concerns are growing that, as the Americans did, European taxpayers will also have to pay a lot of money to solve the crisis.
The EU has so far not seriously dealt with the crisis that is sweeping the continent .
The 'saviors' will not have to present hundreds of millions of euros immediately, but it would be good if they could define: in what cases is it justified to use taxpayers' funds to prevent a greater evil?
The intelligent car mimics the flight of the bumblebee
What would be the best method for developing technologies to avoid collisions if not by imitating obstacle sensors in nature?
For example, the one about the bumblebees.
In a surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, bumblebees provided the starting point for Nissan engineers to design the next generation of collision prevention systems.
Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the BR23C type robotic steering system for cars that mimics nature, giving it the characteristics of bumblebees, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that can dodge all collisions.
During flight each bumblebee creates its own particular oval space that actually looks a lot like our protective safety capsule - explained Kazuhhiro Doi, RP and development and research technology director at the exhibition.
An important role is played by the compound eyes of bumblebees, which are able to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the compound eyes, the engineers used the laser-beam length measurement system.
It identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C within 2 metres, at a 180-degree angle, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the vehicle's microprocessor which is immediately transformed into a collision avoidance maneuver.
In a fraction of a second, the obstacle is identified, then the vehicle's robot, imitating the movements of the bumblebees, changes direction by turning the wheels as needed.
Unlike any system currently in existence, this maneuver is entirely instinctive.
"Without this, the vehicle robot would not be able to react quickly enough to dodge obstacles", explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the vehicle robot project.
It must react immediately and instinctively, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable inner layer of the safety capsule, in a layer within which all kinds of collisions are currently considered unavoidable.
The whole process should reflect what one bumblebee does to dodge other bumblebees.
This process should be done in the blink of an eye.
However, unlike bumblebees, the movement cannot be directed upwards, downwards or diagonally, but can only be two-dimensional and exclusively in the direction of rotation of the wheels
So instead of the infinite possibilities for the bumblebees to dodge other bumblebees, here they only used the rotary motion and acceleration plus braking as a possibility for the car's robot.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries which are lighter and have a higher energy density, meaning they have a longer life than lithium-ion batteries.
According to Andoh, what is important is the instinctive and intelligent reaction and not the capacity to process data, much less the storage capacity.
This apparatus should only process a few input signals per second and react accordingly.
There is no need to store this data or react with instinctive logic based on the data from the previous maneuvers, so it uses only a few tens of kilobytes of memory.
You don't need gigabytes of memory, you don't need megabytes.
This is the first step in developing the technology to immediately dodge the obstacles, which Nissan estimates will be incorporated into series-produced models within ten years.
Another possibility for its application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to his destination, dodging obstacles in his way.
This precious child has a name
The written version of the law has been prepared for the $700 billion financial rescue package that will be implemented in several phases to buy bad loans from banks.
Half the money will be spent in the first phase.
According to Eastern time during the new consultations that lasted until after midnight on Saturday, congressional leaders reached an agreement on the $700 billion financial rescue package after several days of discussion, Reuters reported.
We have made important progress, said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic president of the US Congress, saying that all that remains is to formalize the agreement in a document.
The commitment made on the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, the Minister of Finance, speaking about the outcome of the compromise, said: "This program will work and be efficient but other measures are needed". According to Pelosi, it's not about saving Wall Street, but turning the wheel of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e. before 8 p.m. on Sunday, Washington time (i.e. before 2 a.m. on Monday, Central European time), without causing a dramatic jump in the stock markets.
The bill called the 2008 Economic Stabilization Emergency Act will be voted on Monday first by the U.S. Congress and then by the Senate.
President George W. Bush on Saturday night consulted with Pelosi and then the White House also celebrated the news of the deal.
We are pleased with the progress made overnight and highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy", said Tony Fratto, the White House spokesman.
The program is different from the Bush administration's original proposal to spend all 700 billion dollars to buy bad credit fund securities.
Now only half of the $700 billion will be spent, using $250 billion immediately after Congress votes, probably on Monday, of which the Treasury will buy bad credit-fund securities, and the fate of another $100 billion depends on the president's decision.
This programme will be controlled by a special body, in which the chairman of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of the $700 billion will be spent after a new decision by Congress.
Under the law the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy bad loans, mortgages and securities, credit fund securities, plus other "poisonous" loans as well.
The purchase can be done by auction or directly - informed competent persons of the ministry.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme where the financial portfolio guarantees the items of concern, for which the companies will pay the amount corresponding to the foreseeable damages.
Henry Paulson said: the law thus ensures the necessary financial means, which can reach up to 700 billion dollars to meet the urgent needs of the North American financial system, be it the purchase of bad financial means, their insurance or the prevention of risks that could cause the collapse of some large financial institutions.
We are doing everything necessary to be ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed - he added.
Instead, the heads of the banks who are in trouble and waiting for state help will be able to count on the official limitation of their compensation, which the American slang simply calls gold parachutes.
Only in certain cases will payments be limited, and the limitations depend on the form of aid from the Ministry of Finance.
The limitation means that if the ministry buys in the framework of an auction, an extra tax will be imposed on gold parachutes, unless the failed bank boss retires.
By buying bad credit directly, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the compensation of the bosses is not overstated.
In addition, the existing gold parachute contracts will not be changed, the limitations are only for new contracts to stimulate participation in the programme.
This is the first time in American history that a legal limitation on the income of general managers will be in effect - said Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the congressional committee responsible for financial services.
The State will also be entitled to acquire shares of the banks participating in the programme, thus reducing the risk for taxpayers, who will ultimately be able to profit from the transaction once the economy and the bank recover.
According to the bill, in the next five years, the president must present to Congress a proposal on how to pay back taxpayers for financial sector losses.
Of course, there were those on both sides who expressed reservations about the project.
This is not what the American citizens have entrusted us with, that is, they are not protecting taxpayer dollars - declared Republican Congressman Darrell Issa of California.
His Ohio Democrat colleague, Mary Kaptur, said the measures were urged by the same people responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Domestic selling prices in the manufacturing sector increased slightly, by 0.1% compared with July.
The largest increase in the magnitude of prices occurred in August 2008 in the leather and footwear production sector (2,8%) due primarily to the increase of 4,6% in bags and belts and the increase of 2,5% in footwear.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical base materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical materials production branch (1.6%).
Price declines were recorded in the petrochemical sector (1.4%), in the production of electrical machinery and instruments (0.9%) and, to a lesser extent, in the wood processing sector (0.1%).

In the rest of the processing industry, prices increased by between 0.2 and 0.9%.
The supply of electricity, gas, heat and water, which are important in domestic trade, increased by 0.3% in August, primarily as a result of the increase in official prices from 1 July.
In a comparison over a 12-month period - in domestic sales of the processing industry sectors - the largest price increase was recorded in the petrochemical sector (32.4%).
The metalworking sector saw an increase of 13.2%, while the food, beverage and tobacco industry, which was a major player, saw an increase of 11%.
Prices fell in the textile industry (2.5%) and in the manufacture of electrical machinery and instruments (0.3%).
In the other processing sectors, the rate of price growth was between 0.6% and 9.1%.

The price of our national currency fell by 1.7% against the euro and by 7.1% against the dollar in one month, compared with August 2007 when it strengthened by 7.5% against the euro and 15.9% against the dollar.
Next year, you won't need a visa to come to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes there is a good chance that the US-Hungary visa-free agreement will come into force around 12 January - the foreign minister spoke about it in Chicago, to the Hungarians living there.
In his view, 'virtually everything depends on the timely construction of the electronic access and control system on the other side of the Atlantic'.
At the same time, he warned that the entry premise will disappear in the new system, but tourists must register before leaving their country of origin.
As of today, the Hungarian foreign minister is holding talks in Washington.
He will meet with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, presenting her with the Median Cross with Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and hold negotiations with the international policy advisers of the presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favor of the financial bailout package for the banks.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both presidential candidates from the two major North American parties, on Sunday assured their support for the administration's $700 million banking aid program, while politicians are demanding the resignation of the finance minister.
Representatives of the Congress and the administration, after several days of marathon-type negotiations, announced early Sunday morning: a principled agreement was reached on the financial rescue package for the banks.
The financial package to solve the Wall Street crisis and unfreeze the frozen credit market became the central issue of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to prove that they are more capable than their rivals of pulling the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, with economic issues coming to the fore, Obama regained some advantage and the McCain advantage that had been gained after the Republican convention with Sarah Palin's candidacy for vice president disappeared.
At a campaign rally in Detroit last Sunday, Obama expressed hope that Congress would quickly pass the $700 billion package law.
He stressed that the proposal included those points of consumer protection, which he himself supported.
"We have to act now and with responsibility (...) employment, savings for you, as well as entire industries and the stability of the entire economy are in danger" - he told a crowd of 35 thousand people.
He took the opportunity to call McCain's economic concepts obsolete.
In an interview with ABC, McCain explained that "we're all going to swallow this with a hard time (...) but doing nothing is simply not a viable path".
The Republican senator said that the proposal includes the establishment of a control commission to the minister of fines and the limitation of the executives' indemnities, he was the one who insisted on that.
Obama told CBS that McCain played no major role in the consultations, instead he consulted with the minister daily.
Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that lawmakers will likely vote on the bill on Monday.
German-language press magazine
The right-wing group is intact, only that within the group itself the voters became more aware - says Der Spiegel about the weak election result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider and his followers are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a Red-Negro coalition.
The Commission has not yet decided on the application of the measures.
In the electronic edition of the left-wing German magazine Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution devours its parents" he analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU had begun long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber had taken office.
The Christian Socialists were developing Bavaria for several decades - and now it is precisely these modern citizens who are turning their backs on it.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem for all Christian democracy, as well as for Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but on Sunday a process that had been foreseen for almost ten years was completed: the indisputable hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU got 47.7 percent, the first time it was below 50 percent since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago, in the 2005 Bundestag elections, during the much-mentioned Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consistent modernization of the CSU in the province devouring its progenitors .
The social scientists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they were very wrong in the pace. However, secularization, the results of education and the settlement of the North Germans in the developed regions of Bavaria had their negative consequences on the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernisation also increases the possibilities and this also has political consequences.
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group itself the voters became more conscious, more critical and more stubborn.
It is surprising that in recent weeks it was the conventional groups of citizens who moved away from CSU the most: the self-employed, small industrialists, those with a bachelor's degree and those with a diploma.
Thus, support for the CSU fell to less than 40 percent.
The press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna newspaper: "Who with whom? In its article entitled "The party leaders are very reserved on coalition issues" - deals with the confused situation of domestic politics after the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP forbids the SPÖ from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, while the Greens are not yet willing to consult on the coalition.
The elections have already taken place, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate on public television, the leaders of the parties barely let their cards show.
Werner Faymann, the SPÖ president, confirmed that he wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is possible - it already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman left open the question of whether he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, in the post of vice-chancellor.
He said that they had in any case disapproved of the Schüssel-Molterer era.
It is not possible to follow this political trend.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
He said that cooperation would not be successful if Faymann tried to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
It is still open in the party whether they will choose the opposition or enter the coalition, these issues should be discussed without a doubt, within the ÖVP itself.
The President of the BZÖ, Jörg Haider, was open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to take responsibility for the government" - said Haider.
Járóka: We must break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
The European Summit on Equal Opportunities has opened in Paris today. It is being hosted by France, which is also the European Union's President-in-Office this year.
Lívia Járóka, MEP for the European People's Party (Fidesz), in her speech to the plenary, as one of the main speakers at this professional meeting, drew attention to segregation in education because it is one of the most serious violations that hit Roma children and is also the biggest obstacle to the prevailing foundation of their interests.
This high-level conference was opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The meeting was attended by representatives of governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European organisations for the protection of social rights.
Járóka - according to the press office of the Fidesz group of MEPs in the European Parliament - warned that in addition to discrimination in employment, Gypsies are left out of the labour market primarily because of their low level of education.
"Most young Roma have not completed secondary education and because of the poor quality of basic education, only a negligible part can obtain a university diploma".
Járóka also stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, has a decisive role in the prevailing foundation of other human rights as well.
Investing in the early education of Roma children can strengthen the economies of the Member States of the European Union.
The MEPs also called for the EU to take the necessary steps to ensure that the EU's citizens are given the right to vote and to stand as a candidate for the EU's presidency.
The earlier a Gypsy student starts school, the more likely he will be to become an active member of the labour market; through income and consumption taxes he will also contribute to the national budget.
"Gypsies, as citizens of the European Union, must be guaranteed the right to quality education and the abolition of segregated and low-level education" - said Lívia Járóka.
The European Parliament is also expected to take a decision on the future of the EU's education system, which will be implemented by the Commission in the coming months.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, we must offer Roma children the possibility guaranteed by democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens", Járóka said.
The objective of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, which has been organised annually since last year's Berlin meeting, under the banner of the 'European Year of Equal Opportunities', is to ensure a unique forum for promoting the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities at European and national level in the Member States.
CSU: pardon for a transitional period
A decision on the fate of the failed Huber-Beckstein duo will be taken at the end of October
Despite the heavy electoral defeat, the heads of the Bavarian CSU have not yet been cut off, and the debate on personal matters has been postponed for the time being.
Erwin Huber, party chairman, and Günther Beckstein, provincial premier, still remain in their posts, but it is not known how long the pardon will last.
The fate of the duo, who suffered a catastrophic electoral defeat of 17 percent, will be decided at the party's extraordinary congress to be held on the last weekend of October.
The members of the much-criticized duo gave a hint: they don't hold on to their positions as much.
This was intended to reassure the angry members of their parliamentary group and their grassroots organization, who the day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences because of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - although under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at the height of his career - the Social Christian Union reached 60.7 per cent, whereas now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, it has achieved only 43.4 per cent.
The CSU for 46 years had a "monopoly" in Bavaria which gives 18 percent of German GDP.
Although the Conservatives still dominate the southern province, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, they will undoubtedly have to form a coalition with someone in the future.
As a first sign of the party's restructuring, Vice-President Horst Seehofer, Federal Minister of Agriculture, one of Huber's possible successors, also has a position in the small intelligence group that is initiating negotiations with the liberal FDP and the right-wing Free Electors over a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange thing about fate is that the list of Free Electors includes the parliamentary Gabriele Pauli, whose performance against Stoiber was used for the coup of the Huber-Beckstein duo and then cruelly erased from the stage the ambitious local politics.
The top leadership of the CSU is now investing all their energy in stabilizing Beckstein.
In the transition, Stoiber will also play an active role, as he has been moving the strings in the background, the former provincial government chief and former CSU president described 28 September as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some critical remarks about the CDU, saying that they would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and to Angela Merkel herself as well.
After the September 2009 Bundestag elections, Merkel will not be able to be Chancellor if they are not able to jointly enhance the CSU which played a crucial role in the successes of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel, who could hardly hide her disappointment at the failure, the losses of the CSU will not have a negative impact on the Berlin grand coalition.
This is of course relative: it will not be easier to deal with the wounded CSU and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD with 18.6 percent achieved its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
Lukashenko's opposition: 110 to 0
After the elections on Sunday, there will be no opposition MP in the Belarusian parliament.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by the well-being and stability that Lukashenko guarantees in the country, whereas according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained rather by the violations of the law committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election result.
While the country's 10 million-strong legislature, made up of one hundred and ten deputies, has been without opposition for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections the opposition united under the name of United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) hoped that Lukashenko, who for the fourth time renewed his mandate after the dubious 2006 elections, as a result of the amendment of the Constitution this time would "allow" the entry of some opposition deputies into parliament.
So the ODSZ suppressed the boycott it originally wanted to do.
At the heart of the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia - which took a loan to moderate Russia's increasingly expensive natural gas imports and contributed to the sale to Russia of Beltransgaz, which owns the gas pipeline that runs through the country - wanted to improve its relations with the European Union, which does not allow Lukashenko and other high-level politicians entry because it has a political regime considered undemocratic.
It was a sign of relaxation when the OSCE, when assessing the election campaign, placed more emphasis on the positive phenomena than on the mistakes - such as the ban on participation imposed on one third of the opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE primary report on Monday criticized even the campaign itself - in which opposition candidates were not allowed to appear in the press - and especially that the opposition was not allowed to be present at the vote count.
The opposition is now seeing an improvement in the political climate: political prisoners have been released and Minsk is ready for a small confrontation with Moscow, denying recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus theoretically constitutes a federal state - has been considering the two regions as independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has started", he told the newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable to maintain this situation, even though "the regime is afraid to allow the entry of even one opposition in that weightless parliament".
The opposition is not planning to hold protests at the results, but is trying to get the message out to voters about the need for economic reforms.
- This obviously causes us many problems because we have to print the opposition press in Russia, the local authorities are making it difficult to distribute it, but even so I see that more and more people are supporting change among the elderly too - said Milinkevich, alluding to the Lukashenko regime, which believes that its main result is the creation of social security, is not considered adequate even by the pensioners, who are officially the most subsidized by the regime.
Due to the country's indebtedness and the growing trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the social security system decays, which "looks like the silence of cemeteries", Milinkevich said.
Russian observers, unlike the opposition politician, called the elections democratic.
Sergey Lebedev, head of the CIS mission, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People don't believe in words but in facts", so the lack of opposition is nothing but a testimony to the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast is served before work".
Never before in the history of Chigi Palace have they put automatic doors to control the entry and exit of the staff.
But from today onwards, it starts with this measure against whoever signs and then goes to the bar for coffee during working hours.
This new policy was presented today by the Minister for Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary-General of the Council Presidency, Mauro Masi.
"Automatic doors", says Brunetta, "are an instrument for working better, with greater productivity, more presence and more services".
"A new era of accountability and transparency is now opening.
This is Reformism", Brunetta stresses again.
The Chigi Palace completes the installation of all the Council Presidency buildings.
Masi said that "the choice of automatic doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There has been no resistance from the employees, the secretary-general assures: "it has been a change shared by the workers and there has been collaboration on their part".
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee and lunches.
As Brunetta suggests, smiling, "a good cappuccino at 7 in the morning is a holy hand".
During a convention at the Higher School of Public Administration
The Minister of Health, in Rome, stated that "in three months the absences due to illness of public employees have been reduced by 50%, that is to say 60 thousand more people to work in one year".
He added that the public administration needs to be made more effective.
The Minister explained that in the last 8-10 years, wage dynamics in Italy have been double that in the private sector and well above the inflation rate.
By now millions of public employees have joined in opposing the Brunetta decree rules by joining the petition supported by the Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service shows the numbers, the lowest absenteeism from work for illness  writes the consumer association  the people of 'lazy workers' is continuously increasing.
There are millions of honest and productive public servants in Italy who have joined together to declare war on the illegitimate rules of the decree".
In particular, the TAR addressed the exclusion of economic treatment for sickness on the basis of service, the extension of the time slots during which medical checks on sick employees are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions requested by the Minister.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: "Prevention is crucial"
Every day in Italy, there are 2,500 accidents at work, 3 people die and 27 are permanently disabled.
For 2007, Inail data effectively confirms that white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
These figures testify to the seriousness of a phenomenon that is one of the leading causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic issue, today Anmil is celebrating the 58th National Day for Victims of Work-related Accidents in all the Italian provinces, which is celebrated on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data disseminated by the Anmil and the same tragic news these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is", says the president of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the president of the Anmil, National Association of mutilated and invalided by work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expressed his "great appreciation for the constant associative commitment to workplace prevention, the protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of victims and public awareness".
"A 'enough' has been expressed, sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies which, by their dimensions, arouse the clamor of the media and the participation of public opinion, whereas the daily reality proposes dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamics".
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector to increase the awareness of young people entering the world of work are particularly important.
It is a duty to keep the attention on the phenomenon alive, not to stop the alarm about the social gravity, to implement and improve the legislative norms.
For his part, the President of the Chamber, Gianfranco Fini, stressed that "the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes on all institutions a determined commitment to put an end to it urgently".
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not mean that the number of white deaths is not less impressive", said Anmil president Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not want this 'declining trend' to translate into less attention, because it is precisely when attention decreases that tragedy explodes.
"We believe that, on the whole, too little is being done to counter the phenomenon of accidents and that the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
The Commission has also been asked to examine the situation in the Member States, and to consider whether the measures taken by the Member States are compatible with the common agricultural policy.
"It is necessary to make further efforts to communicate and raise public awareness.
But above all it serves to increase the sense of responsibility on the part of employers in relation to a phenomenon which represents a social emergency".
Mercandelli has denounced "the progressive deterioration of the level of subsidiary protection provided for victims of work" and the "deviation towards care towards which the system is heading in recent years".
"The aim is to restore the worker's insurance guarantee - he added  because the luck of the person who accidents does not have to depend on the donation provided by the legislator each time".
MP3 players under indictment, putting the hearing at risk
Listening to music at a high volume for a long period of time using portable music devices such as MP3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
The European Commission, in a statement released in Brussels, quotes the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Recently Identified Health Risks (CSERSERI) of the EU, published today.
"From this scientific opinion, it is noted that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical instruments weekly for more than one hour a day with the device at high volume risk a permanent loss of hearing ability".
"I am concerned that such a high number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and cell phones at high noise levels may unconsciously ruin their ears in an irreparable way", says Meglena Kuneva.
'From the scientific evidence, the EU is responsible - a clear risk emerges and we must react quickly.
What matters is to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
We must also review existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion so that they are broadly effective and keep pace with new technology.'
Bruxel had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the widespread use of portable musical instruments and the increasing number of young people exposed to the noise it produces.
'Scientists confirm that this is a cause for concern and the European Commission will now examine together with Member States and stakeholders what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical instruments and related devices.'
There is already a European safety standard limiting the noise level of portable musical instruments to 100 dB, but concern is growing as hearing damage can result from excessive exposure to such sources of noise.
It is possible to greatly limit these damages by resorting to solutions such as reducing levels and exposure times to noise.
The EU Scientific Committee notes that if users of portable musical instruments listen to music at a high volume (more than 89 decibels) for only 5 hours a week, they exceed the current limit on maximum noise at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk permanent hearing loss after a period of 5 years.
It means that it affects 5-10% of users of such devices and the number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, German paves the way for the Commission's future for the capital
Today it starts, in March it closes, in June the accounts will be made.
This is the calendar set by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the future of the capital of Rome", which has been installed this morning in its new headquarters behind the Thermal Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will discuss the main points for Rome.
Once the doors are closed in March, the board and the communal council will evaluate analyses and projects, in order to present in June the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Municipality and its intendant Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas. It must provide proposals for the development of Rome in which the political decision-makers, the city council and the city council, can then assert themselves.
There is no over-positioning of roles, only the will to have a place to elaborate a great project for Rome.
In March, the work will be finished, because this experience must have a precise temporal end.
In June, the mayor announced that we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome".
The Commission's comments are not binding, and Mr Alemano says: 'It all depends on the work the Commission is able to do and the quality of its proposals.
If quality is present, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure it is in Rome, your contribution will be essential.
Politics is almost always crushed by ordinary management and emergencies that come back again and again.
We, on the contrary, want to look beyond and to the long term, in a deeper perspective, working seriously for the development of Rome and its future".
The Commission is not a useless or trivial institution: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Romanian citizens a single euro and will serve to engage and reason with the best minds in the capital.
For Alemanno, in fact, "it is necessary to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or stationary, to allow our city to make an authentic leap of level, which we absolutely need, thinking with a united spirit about its future".
A future which, the mayor of Rome said, "would not be confined to the present municipal boundaries but would look beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as capital but "also considering the role that Rome can and must play as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
The first anti-American president.
He has written an American political note that he is interested in passing off as independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions reduced the US economy and tubed relations (as he does today also gives private citizen) with the enemy Islam".
Attacks on Obama are mounting as the election date approaches.
A Miami woman wrote on a Web site: "This person is full of ambition.
Obama has a big face of stone: he thinks he'll win the highest office in the nation that's had two black governors and five black senators!"
They're actually attacks that don't say much; they're clearly racial attacks and they don't answer the voters' question: will he be a good president? And then there's the polls; everyone says Obama will win and with a good lead.
Here too there are those who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A newspaper in Mississippi, in the deep south of the United States, has written an editorial: Once in the voting booth, we will know for sure whom the American patriot will vote for.
It's a side of the American mentality that's been covered up to the last detail.
"Say what you will, we'll figure out where to put the cross later, whether it's Obama or McCain".
There are people who swear that if Obama wins, we'll leave America.
Things never said before now, that seems almost certain the black candidate will succeed.
Yet despite all these arguments, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people, what were the mistakes Bush made during his tenure, and 89 percent said, Iraq.
It changes America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home kicked in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack.
Likewise, Iraq has been for most Bush's weak spot.
Whoever takes the place of George W. will have a huge duty to discharge.
In the United States, the economic collapse is also felt by journalists: it is time for newspapers to be cut off, and many blame the Internet, the "killer" of print.
Five hundred American journalists have been interviewed by PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mind control for the future.
Today, however, journalists are almost all pessimistic about its future.
However, journalists have not openly stated that they feel any less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the room where the editors work to make the newspaper, is a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as understood by the majority of the public is not to be substantially reduced.
A clear but complex pessimism prevails today in the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that journalism at the national level is going down the wrong path.
In the local field the executive group is 65%.
Print against emission.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web is going.
The biggest publishing houses are breaking into the Internet, seen by many as the "killer" of the printed letter.
The "economic pressure" that journalists warn has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that it "will do something good" for journalism.
The biggest rift in American journalism today is between who runs the newspapers - the editors - and the journalists who work for them.
56% of national executives are confident that their journalists share the same values, while at local level the percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this has to do with "work safety".
The executives who think they're going to lose their jobs in three years are 47% nationally.
For the news staff, it's 30%.
The issue of "safe work" at the staff level in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want and it becomes a matter of "take it or leave it".
Directors are almost always well paid, while editors can earn up to $10,000 a month, plus retirement and social security.
For holidays, the reasoning becomes complicated: a total of days in the first year, another after the third to reach 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, he admits, "sick" regularly throughout the year.
It's all about the weather.
UNIPOL: Rome's court, DANILO COPPOLA is left in the gutter
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the request of real estate agent Danilo Coppola, who had asked to be allowed to move from his home town, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppola is under investigation for bankruptcy in the investigation into the Unipol-Bnl escalation pact.
In the course of the arrest process at his charge, last week, he has obtained the release of his residence, turning it into a compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had requested that the real estate agent be allowed to travel the route from the city of the province to a room in the capital.
According to the court, these trips (for which the PM has voted against) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence against him.
The Elites in Danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago with the House of Representatives' vote against the $700 million bailout plan put in place by the White House: a significant portion of Americans were, and are, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
We are given confirmation by yesterday's New York Times reporting that the ongoing crisis is disarming the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, pro-federal institutions and the business community, and its new, conservative soul, hostile to those in Washington and the financial world, strong especially in the central and southern states.
The soul, in fact, which has become overbearing with the vote of who spoke at the beginning.
This is just one example of the mutations, the great mutations, that the ongoing economic earthquake heralds: not only in the United States but throughout the West and not just here.
In the United States and in Europe, the crisis has long seemed to act as an accelerator of incubation phenomena that with the new climate solidify and come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-activation, the extraordinary reactivation, of the dual category of state-sovereignty in relation to a type of re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis is indeed a crisis of banking and financial institutions which have, yes, strong financial relations with the outside world, but above all the balance sheets of families living in a single country and in a single state are much more compromised.
The first is that the Commission has not yet decided on the future of the Community.
The crisis appears economically global but politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems to be substantially out of the question or they have little to say: the crucial proof is that the European Union, divided as always between different interests and different state strategies, cannot decide on any common policy.
It is from the government of each state that everyone expects an intervention, rescue and reactivation plans, new rules and above all the subsidization of funds: from the moment you reach the court it is only the state that has the economic resources and the mass of financial resources to remedy things.
And they also have the means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of incalculable value, values in certain circumstances which no market and no organization will probably ever be able to dispose of in the same measure.
This new emphasis on the nation-state, which the crisis has placed, is in perfect harmony with the new economic development which tends to attribute it to a factor closely linked to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the web of ever more sophisticated technology, of the intangible, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to dominate the world, we realized that our future will instead have to deal increasingly with the intangible things like water, crops and oil.
All things that, you see, can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth but are equally bound together in an absolute way in a circumscribed space, a territory.
So the one who is sovereign certainly has many more cards than the one who is not, and who has the misfortune of living in a position without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second news that but presages a fracture.
When you say Territory, State, Government, you inevitably say Politics and Leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, the objective awareness of the need for leadership, the demand for someone who knows how to take control of the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for the existing leadership, of an economically inadequate kind with many dark zones.
And together something deeper and in a certain disturbing sense: a discredit, an intolerance, an inappropriate image, a sense of remoteness, which tends to involve the entire ruling class of the Western countries in an increasing number.
It seems to be increasingly advanced, in various parts of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same as those of the social elites so far in the boom, the same way of feeling and being, their culture in the comprehensive exception of the term, to have made the time itself and to be more alien to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in short, underground fuels a branching but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which manifests itself in an electoral "revolt" or in the sudden changes in collective moods of recent times, from the conservative exit in Austria-Bavaria to the collapse of the social democratic consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of the men of the American congress against Bush (and also tops with the victory of the right in Italy which has something to do with it).
It seems that the traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, I would say something, make it increasingly difficult to understand and then to represent what is taking shape today as the deepest strata of Western society and which the economic crisis renews, increases and potentially shakes in excess.
In the face of all this, to speak of a "mass rebellion" today is frankly exaggerated.
But having your eyes open certainly isn't.
The super glue for walking on walls
To beat the laws of gravity with super glue and in the future walk on walls like Spider-Man.
It's the focus of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has come pretty close.
With a sticker of just one square inch [2.5 cm], scientists have been able to stick a 100-pound body to a vertical wall.
THE STUDY  The American journal Science has published the findings of researchers at the University of Dayton, the University of Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material the team of researchers invented is an evolution of existing materials that use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The glue principle can be thought of as a series of tubes arranged like a stack of spaghetti", explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the gecko's legs, which are covered with microscopic hairs that can ensure perfect grip.
Tests on different materials, such as glass, teflon, and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the feet of this reptile and at the same time "breaks easily off walls", explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's School of Engineering.
"This material could be useful as a temporary adhesive", adds Liming Dai.
Layers, yes, but researchers are thinking about a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could be related to aerospace engineering.
No superheroes at the moment.
Another investigation - The University of California, Berkeley, is also working on a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society magazine, California researchers have presented a glue made of hair-like microfibers that cleans itself of dust when moving on a surface to always maintain perfect adhesion.
Medicines: never with fruit juice
Watch out for the grapefruit juice, the orange juice and the apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed mainly in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if taken at the same time as certain medicines, their absorption is altered, increasing or decreasing their efficiency, with serious consequences for health.
The risk of fresh fruit juices being packaged is repeated by the use of certain medicines. David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who has been sounding the alarm since the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, says that a glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of some drugs, negating the beneficial effects and putting patients' health at risk.
Grapefruit juice had already been under indictment because it was held responsible for increasing to toxic levels some antiarrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistamine and neurological medicines.
RISKY DRUGS  The same Italian drug agency had reported the news in a newsletter two years ago, warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger of this mixture and to pay attention to what they drink if they are taking a drug such as Diasepam or Metadone.
Not just the pomelo  Experts say that orange and apple juice also contain drug-inhibiting substances.
A long list of the active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department at the State University of Milan, calls: "These findings are generally reported to the various international and national drug agencies, which may change the information notes.
That is why we must always read the illustrative leaflets of the medicines that are taken and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not let ourselves be impressed, ask clearly the doctor or the pharmacist", the expert of the ANSA agency stressed.
The novel of economics to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics has been awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies, his models of trade and on the localization of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a noted columnist for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most vocal critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy decisions.
A few months after the September 11 attacks, in those days when Enron was breaking up, Krugman had predicted in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences for the United States.
A prediction that has been controversial and for several years blamed on the economy, but which has now proved accurate.
"I am surprised and a little upset that the memory of the Enron and Worldcom collapse scandal has quickly disappeared from public attention", Krugman had stated in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the European Central Bank's executive committee, Krugman is a "highly valued economist" but also a "very aggressive style" whistleblower, particularly critical of the excesses of liberalism in the Bush administration.
Open Office, echo of the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of the launch of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source personal productivity suite that aims to attract more and more users, from home to office to public administration professionals, as a free alternative to the well-known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work by volunteer developers, whose backs are watched by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several novelties: to the welcome screen and the less coarse revised interface, more consistent ones are added, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) ISO 1.2, the latest standard version.
Attention is also paid to the multi-function with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new extension of Microsoft (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific functions of some modules such as the one that allows to reduce the size of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example, to send it via e-mail, or the possibility of importing the PDF file in the graphic processing module, preserving the original appearance of the page.
Always on this front you can create "hybrid PDF" documents, which accumulate the typical graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a word processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received different improvements inside the applications: in the spreadsheet, various users can intervene, avoiding the conflicts of modifications, in the elaboration of texts, each collaborator is given a color in the comment for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice functionality to the Web (on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should give the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and is added to the English version that was in the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
The installation CD can also be sent to home or work on request.
And if the topic of free can be a hook for the diffusion in the houses, it is in the business field that Open Office the suite tests, tries the big bet, being able to count on several projects carried out in the public administration and in schools.
There is also a need for a training, consultation and assistance service which is ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, where business prospects could be opened.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for video writing the corresponding Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for the presentation of Powerpoint; Dbase, e.g. in the case of the well-known Access is the program that allows to work in the data base; and finally Draw the graphic module.
The target for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that we have reached almost 3 million 600 thousand so far, with the release of the new version it is likely that the figure expected can be exceeded.
Kohl also tested positive. It's the fourth doping case.
A new positive case in the Tour de France: it's the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, of the Gerolsteiner team, third-place and winner of the best climber's remera.
The news is on the website of the newspaper L'Equipe.
Kohl, 26, is the fourth Epo-positive third-generation rider, after Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The analysis of Kohl's blood samples is among those carried out in recent weeks at the laboratory in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter tests confirm that he's positive, the Austrian will lose his third place at the Tour and will face two years of canonical disqualification.
The news of Kohl's positive doping in third-generation EPO was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who told the Associated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian has placed on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, taking the top-ranked climber's jersey.
Is Italy racist or is it a crime against humanity?
Italy has only recently become a prime destination for immigrants who are received with hostility.
Is this turning the beautiful country into a nation of racists? asks the New York Times in a long article that has been devoted to the debate on the issue of racism in Italy starting from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre originally from Burkina Faso who was murdered last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case illustrates what the New York Times calls the "northern paradox": the northern regions are at once those with "more integration and more work" but also the highest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the highest support in the Northern League".
As confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times has also cited episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not alone.
The new legislation, which the League wants to tighten the brakes on immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is also cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
The trend is marked by both the Pope and the president of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, meeting Benedict XVI in the Congress, has asked that the State and the Church work together to combat racism".
Students victims of expensive rent, up to 900 euros for a room
The rent market for college students is not in crisis.
According to the latest survey by Sunia, the tenants' union, renting a single room could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has already taken on very serious characteristics to the point of excluding the right to study to a large part of young people because of the very high costs that the family would have to bear" explains the head of the Sunia studies office, Laura Mariani "in these cities the strong demand has totally deformed the market to such an extent as to trigger a process of increase generalized even for residents".
Apart from that in most cases rental offers contain a series of violations: free type contracts, unregistered, no fee limit, sub-leases linked.
For Sunia, extraordinary measures are necessary to regulate prices through the revision of taxation.
Looking at the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in Brianza, they serve about 450 euros; for an individual room from a minimum of 650 (zone Bande Nere) to an average value of 800 (zone Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (in Victoria).
In Florence, a bed costs on average 350-400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas close to the University, they serve 250/280 euros for a bed in a double room and 370 to 500 for an individual.
In Rome in the central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Plaza Bologna) you are asked for about 600 euros for a single room and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower prices (550 euros for a single room) in areas close to other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
It is only economical if you change the peripheral area: 300 euros for a bed and 450 for an individual room in Prenestina, Centocelle and surroundings.
In Naples, a bed costs 300/450 euros, a room costs 400-600 euros, and the highest prices are in the areas of the Polyclinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, you get 250/350 euros for a bed, at least 350 for an individual.
In smaller cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but it has a greater weight in the city's economy.
In cities such as Perugia, where the phenomenon of renting to students and non-EU nationals is more frequent, there is another anomaly: the fee for foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared with the Italian one.
Goodbye to the old Paradiso cinema, cities cancel the historic theatres
Historic movie theaters are closing in favor of multiplexes.
"A city without movie theaters in a blind city, is like a face without eyes".
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographs what is happening in the major Italian urban centres and also in the provincial cities.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, which with the birth of the big meticulos in the periphery and the consequent disappearance of the mono theatres in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
It's almost always historical places, full of memories, that disappear", it's as if a friend died, an acquaintance with whom you shared a piece of place and so much emotion, Observa the director of the new cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago won the cousin Oscar and the grand jury prize at Cannes, which told the poetry of a provincial cinema and the nostalgia for the way of life of cinema that lost perhaps forever.
The figures given by Anec, the main trade association, are clear: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have closed, the bulk of which is paid for by the major cities: 10 fewer in Florence, 9 fewer in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 fewer in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The regions most affected by the closures are Emilia-Romagna with 82 fewer cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
It is a demonstration that the cause of its disappearance is the advent of multiplex cinema, which is typical of these three Italian regions that have registered the largest number of new meticulous cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany than in Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian exercise has developed irrationally", comments Paolo Protti, President of Anec",it would be useful to build new structures but it would be necessary to ensure the permanence of existing ones, because when a town hall closes, not all its visitors are willing to move to the meticulous.
Not to mention the lack of funds for the merchants: the previous state debt is about 10 million euros.
It is a shame from an ethical and moral point of view, that the government does not respect the laws that exist.
The sector would need between 16 and 18 million euros a year to sustain itself.
Interestingly, the case of Bologna, the first Italian city to be concerned about closures, decided to make amends by signing a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to promote and protect the mono-salo cinema in the historic centre as well as in the periphery.
The rules include tax incentives for operators and advantages for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic zone and will have special parking charges.
"It's an initiative I like", says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope other cities will follow Bologna's example by putting in place other measures.
True, to counter the extra power of meticulous music, traditional theatres have to improve the quality of sound and image because the public today is more demanding.
The defence of traditional cinema is a topic that has always been important to me: the closure of the Bagheria cinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make the "New Cinema Paradiso", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I've lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass by the Rialto or the Quirinale of Via Nazionale, which is now closed, where I've experienced so many shared emotions, so as not to see the signs blackened by the dust, I turn the other way.
Politics and 'ndrangheta, the mayor of Gioia Tauro has been arrested
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to uniform the Municipality elections for those interested in the Piromalli cause".
The accusations of the magistrates of the Antimafia Directorate of Calabria against the mayor and vice-mayor of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for mafia association, are heavy.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the elder mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson lawyer, the boss's namesake, have been arrested for criminal mafia association and ordered to pay 10 million euros in damages.
"Disregarding any legal and moral norms, and good sense", the prosecutors write, the two local administrations had expressed a willingness to pay consultations to Piromalli.
"The mafia family would have been allowed to officially enter the municipality, facilitating the great possibility of control and command of the public administration".
The president of the Calabrian regional board Agazio Loiero does not hide that "agreements between the organized bad life are a lot" in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'ndrangheta, heroes who keep clean".
This morning's arrests are added to those last July after police had announced the beheading of the Piromalli mafia family.
Since the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, already in 1991 and always by presumed conditions between organized crime and the local administration, local politicians had been relieved of the task of administering the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the incumbent of the Udc at the time of the dissolution, after the May 2006 ballot, had been elected as head of a centre-right coalition.
I exploded a scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the city council.
I call in question the Deputy Minister of the Interior who at that time was Marco Minniti, accusing him of having organized everything for a political issue, but the judges in the arrest warrant signed this morning explain that Piromalli had even asked for the variation of the A3 road project.
The environmental interceptions made to Dal Torrione, the judges write, show "the willingness to favor the demands of an entrepreneur, representative of a group very close to the Piromalli clan, uniforming the elections of the public administration on the interests of the mafia families".
When energy is born from the waves, the great ones come down to the stage
It's an extinct deposit that covers over 70% of the planet's surface and is being discovered now by the world's big energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources that big companies like Chevron are looking at.
The possibility of harvesting energy from sea movements has been studied for a hundred years and in the 1970s, together with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell in 1980, the idea of harnessing marine energy was shelved, but now that environmental issues and the new oil boom are giving the sector a boost.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London has estimated that by 2007 15 percent of the world's electricity needs could be met by devices that exploit the movement of ocean waves.
This would be twice as much as is produced by nuclear power plants today.
And then there would be the currents and the tides.
Giants to the attack.
The first company to invest in marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build an implant in northern Portugal.
When the intention was announced it seemed like a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more companies are betting on marine energy, and among these companies are those who have always voted for traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technology", a spokesman for a company associated with the U.S. oil giant told the Wall Street Journal, "and is considering cooperating with us".
The cooperation in question is about obtaining a permit from the US Energy Commission to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It's a pretty important sign, considering that in Alaska the U.S. is still drilling for oil and recently President Bush has activated a plan to drill for more.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey are following the path of energy from the sea, the total invested so far, although not detailed, indicates an increasing interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts are talking about a technology that is still in its infancy, because there is no doubt that marine energy has a great environmental impact.
For now, impacts like those in Portugal or Scotland are small and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, a technology with a greater environmental impact must be used.
And the options are several: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of boas joined together.
The force of the waves, which moves the boas up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders inside them.
The pressure turns a turbine, which in turn powers a generator.
Electricity is sent to the coast via submarine cables.
Right now there are four such implants under development, pending federal approval only, apart from the energy, could be used for a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces power for a shopping mall and a parking lot, using underwater turbines in New York's East River.
The movement of water at high tide causes the turbine paddles to rotate, creating a rotary motion that feeds the generator.
Verdant has said he has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary permits to use the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say at the Institute for the Development of Electrical Energy, is the potential of tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, tides are more preventable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It's mostly tidal energy that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others that are approaching the coast, have invested $7.5 million in 2008 and are planning to invest $35 million by 2009.
