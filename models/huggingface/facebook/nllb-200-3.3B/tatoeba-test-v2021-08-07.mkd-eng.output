I gave up smoking.
I gave up.
I raise cattle.
The Iranians are a peaceful people.
I read his book.
I read Tom a story.
I realized I hadn't eaten yet.
I'm really getting married.
I really like you.
I really don't know.
I really like the way your hair looks.
I really like wine.
I really like your website.
I really love your older sister.
I really missed you.
I really miss my mother's cooking.
I really miss them.
I really want to help him.
I really want to know what's going on here.
I really want to learn French.
It would be really nice if you shut up.
I got this fax from her.
I recognize the pattern.
I refuse to do that.
I refuse to work.
I remember when I met the Queen.
I despise his rude attitude.
I respect the decision you made.
I cried once.
Iron is harder than gold.
Isaac Newton died a virgin.
I said I'd bring it.
I said he might come back.
I told you to open the door.
I said we're closed.
I said yes.
Is there someone in there?
Is anyone surprised?
Did you miss something?
I saw a ghost last night.
I've seen an unidentified flying object.
I saw her a week ago.
I just saw him.
I saw you playing cards with all of them.
I saw him out there.
I saw my sister cut the letter.
But I didn't see anything.
I saw that.
I saw them.
I saw the sponge in the sink.
I saw Tom do that.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I saw Tom.
How far is Boston?
Is Buddhism a Religion or a Philosophy?
Does Dan know what he's done?
Are the potatoes high in calories?
I don't see a conspiracy here.
"I see", said the blind man.
I see Tom every day.
I see you're awake.
I sent Tom to Boston with me.
I left early to catch the first train.
Is everyone booked?
Is everyone happy?
Is everybody having a good time?
Is that all there?
Is he breathing?
Did his aunt eat an apple or a banana?
I nodded my head.
I should definitely buy you a drink.
I should feel sorry for them.
I need to take her home.
I have to pack.
I have to go change.
I should go home.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I shouldn't have eaten so much ice cream.
I shouldn't have gone to Tom.
I should sue him.
I should look.
I should try to help them.
I should have asked her first.
I should have asked them first.
I should have asked you first.
I should have been more polite.
I should have checked.
I should have done that yesterday.
I should have known you'd be here.
I should have said no.
I showed her my room.
Is it cold outside?
Is it ready?
How far is it from here?
Is Tatoeba really very slow today, or is it just me?
Is that the last lesson?
Is it time to go?
Is that true?
I got him a clap.
I sleep on my feet.
I sleep standing up.
I slept like a baby.
I slept in the bushes.
I slept on the bus.
I cut the sandwich.
Has Mike stopped drinking?
I smiled.
Isn't that exciting?
Isn't it possible that Tom did this?
Isn't that unusual?
Isn't that dangerous?
Isn't that enough?
Isn't that a little extreme?
Isn't that good news?
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy your house?
Isn't this wonderful?
I kind of like it.
I spent all day cleaning snow.
She's a taxi driver?
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Is she really that pretty?
Is that your mother?
I got the guy.
I started seeing him.
I started thinking about him.
I found something strange.
Is that all Tom does?
Is that all we need?
Is that a rhetorical question?
Does that mean "yes" or "no"?
Is that a word?
Is that necessary?
Is that necessary?
Is that sarcasm?
Is that satisfactory?
Is that Tom's coat?
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
Is that what you did to them?
So that's where Tom is?
Is that why I'm here?
Is that why you're here?
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Is that why you won't help us?
Is that your package?
Is the bridge secure?
Is the coffee hot?
Is the house ready?
Is the lake deep?
Is there a delivery charge?
Is there a doctor here who speaks English?
Is there food?
Is there anyone else?
Is there someone else here?
Is there sugar?
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Is there a problem?
Is there a reward?
Is there anything specific you'd like to see?
Is this about Tom?
Is this a better time to talk?
Is this in place?
Is this diamond real?
Is that moral?
Is this correct English?
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
Is this our cabin?
Is this your radio?
Is someone sitting here?
Is this seat available?
Is this what all the excitement was about?
Is this your picture?
Is this your bag?
Is this your bag or his?
Is this yours, Tom?
I still can't believe Tom is gone.
I still can't believe it somehow.
I still don't get it.
I still don't know how to do that.
I still don't understand women.
I still respect Tom.
I still want a horse.
I stole it from them.
Can Tom swim?
Is Tom back?
Is Tom conscious?
Does Tom contribute?
Is Tom dead?
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Is Tom funny?
Is Tom in Boston?
Is Tom interested in it?
Is Tom looking for them?
Is Tom harassing you?
Is Tom safe?
Is Tom still alive?
Did you say Tom?
Is Tom alone there?
Is Tom with you now?
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
I lit a match in the dark.
I'm a student of art history.
I suddenly felt old.
I have asthma.
I suggest you study more.
I suggest we focus on finding a way out of the cave.
I suggest we go home.
I'm hungry for you to come.
I suggest you send someone out to see what's going on.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
I guess that's okay.
I had my doubts.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
I was swimming in the river.
I swear it wasn't me.
I swear it was them.
I swear, I wouldn't even get my hands on you if you were the last bucket of water.
I sweat every day.
Is your freezer still working?
Is your head full of straw?
I'm taking the opportunity to thank her.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
I've been talking to my advisors about what subjects to take.
It all makes sense.
It all seems so pointless.
It always happens the same way.
It couldn't have been a coincidence.
So, no, not at all.
It's not possible!
It's about you.
It cost a lot more than I expected.
Never, ever, could that happen here.
There's no way that was Tom.
That would be a disaster.
That would be good.
I didn't care.
We didn't mention that.
It wasn't that bad.
That disappointed him.
It looked good.
Don't bother me.
They won't get better.
Doesn't look much different.
It doesn't matter that you don't want to do it; you have to do it anyway.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't seem to help.
It doesn't sound like much.
That doesn't surprise me.
I teach Chinese.
I teach him English.
I don't know.
That gave me an idea.
I've got things to do.
It had to be done.
It must have originated somewhere.
It's up to you.
It happened too fast.
It happens.
It's all happening now.
It's cold.
It's not about luck.
It wasn't easy.
It has sentimental value.
I've been thinking about it for days.
I think about him every day.
I think he's right.
I think he's right.
I think he's hiding something.
I think I can.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I think I'd better help him.
I think I'd better help them.
I think I found one.
I think I have a cold.
I think I know him.
I think I know how to find him.
I think I know how to stop it from happening again.
I think I'll go eat out.
I think I'm going to go visit Tom and see how he's doing.
I think I love you.
I think I made a pretty good statement.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy, you know?
I think I might be able to nod.
I think I'm going to be fine.
I think I should check on Tom.
I think I should have asked for help.
I think I speak French pretty well.
I think it's too risky without any help.
I think it would be best if I stayed here for a while.
I think it's time we start getting ready.
I think it's time for you to go.
I think it's time we start getting ready.
I think it would be a mistake to lend Tom money.
I think I figured out what time we're supposed to leave.
I think I made a mistake.
I think I might be able to help her.
I think she's good at dancing.
I think so.
I think that hotel's gonna be a little expensive.
I think that's awful.
I think that's silly.
I think that's Tom.
I think you're right.
I think the box is empty.
I think they saw me.
I think Tom can help.
I think Tom has gone.
I think Tom is not breathing anymore.
I think Tom is heartless.
I think Tom is conservative.
I think Tom is brave.
I think Tom is crazy.
I think Tom is dying.
I think Tom is funny.
I think Tom is wonderful.
I think Tom is harsh.
I think Tom is hurt.
I think Tom is evil.
I think Tom is nice.
I think Tom is fat.
I think Tom is small-minded.
I think Tom is a snitch.
I think Tom is rich.
I think Tom is right.
I think Tom is stoned.
I think Tom is vain.
I think Tom is sensitive.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
I don't think Tom will go.
I think we can get him.
I think we'd better not drink this water.
We better not go out in a storm like this.
I think we'll join them.
I think we're close to a solution.
I think we're ready.
I think we should call him.
I think we should help him.
I think we should hire him.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I think we've had enough to eat.
I think we found one.
I think you did it.
I think you did that on purpose.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know Tom.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I think you know who I am.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
I think you should call him.
I think you panicked.
I think you're overstating the issue.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
I think you should choose her.
I think you should do this yourself.
I mean, help me.
I think you've been here before.
I think you've been living in the jungle too long.
I think you've been lied to.
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
I think you need to deal with this on your own.
I think you've helped enough.
I thought about what Tom said.
I was thinking of you.
I thought she had bigger boobs.
I thought he was in there.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
I thought I'd ask them for help.
I thought I lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I thought I'd never find him.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I thought I was getting it.
I thought you already found a place to stay.
I thought they found him.
I think this is over.
I thought Tom had a good time.
I thought Tom retired.
I thought that maybe Tom knew where Mary had put the key.
I thought that Tom might not want to go with us.
I thought Tom was originally from Boston.
I thought Tom would be here.
I thought Tom was sick.
I thought Tom would be busy.
I thought Tom wouldn't want any help.
I thought Tom wouldn't want to go with us.
Didn't we have a deal?
I thought we could help you.
I thought we could sit here for a while and talk.
I thought we could visit the museum together.
I think you're gonna be pretty busy.
Didn't you want the prize?
I thought you found someone else.
I thought you lost your wristwatch.
So you don't hate him?
He seemed tired.
I thought maybe you could help.
I thought you might be interested to know.
I thought you only dated girls shorter than you.
So you didn't know how to play the piano?
Didn't you say you could swim?
Didn't you say you wanted to go with us?
I thought you were a better chess player than me.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I thought you were funny.
I thought you were going to live with us.
I thought you were in Boston.
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I thought you weren't busy.
I didn't think you'd like Tom.
It hurts so bad here.
Mary gets upset when Tom leaves the cloth cap up.
It's a multi-step process.
That depends on whether we buy it or not.
It's his first day at school.
It's impossible for me to answer that question.
There's no theoretical chance I can finish the job in one day.
It's less humid today than it was yesterday.
It's not cold at all.
It's not expensive.
It's not over yet.
It's not that bad.
It's not wrong.
Can I use that?
I cry.
It's not on the table.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
It's starting to get to us that we can't ignore nature.
It's warmer today than yesterday.
A famous passage from his essay is worth quoting.
It's written on his forehead.
It's written all over his face.
It just seems wrong to me.
I just don't feel safe about it.
It just sounds boring.
It happens all the time.
It's going to be okay.
It's almost Christmas.
It's gonna be hard to convince them.
It's going to be okay.
It'll be worth it.
It looked terrible.
He looked funny.
You seem to be right.
It looks delicious.
It looks different.
This looks familiar.
It looks like an egg.
I must have had too much to drink last night, my head is spinning, I'm all numb.
Looks like these two are back together.
Looks like these two are cooling it off.
Looks like we're gonna have a snow Christmas this year.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
It looks nice.
I got close to Tom through it.
He's been checking me out.
It worries me.
It could be dangerous.
It might be difficult.
It may be too late.
It may have sounded like a suggestion, but it was an order.
He might be back tonight.
Maybe it seems weird.
It may be a long time before you see me again.
Maybe it is him.
It could be risky.
Maybe this is not just a coincidence.
It might rain today.
It must have been her.
I must have been surprised.
It has to be perfectly symmetrical.
I told them when I saw them, and I told him.
I reported to the police that Tom was with me at the time.
I told Tom about you.
I told Tom he wasn't welcome here.
I told Tom the truth.
I told Tom to tell you that.
I told you I can't.
I told you it would be hard to pull off.
I told you my father died when I was 13.
I told you this was gonna be a pain.
I told you the truth.
I'm a teacher too.
I went on a trip to Boston.
I took care of that.
I got out.
I took the bus back.
I took Tom to lunch.
My pants are off.
I couldn't sleep all night.
I totally get it.
Probably not worth the wait.
It rained two days ago.
It resulted in great hardship.
I tried to explain, but he wouldn't budge.
I tried to find Tom.
I tried to get him to come.
I tried to get them to stop.
I tried to pretend to be something I'm not.
I'm truly sorry about that.
I trust the teacher.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I'm trying not to worry.
It's all about to end.
It's a classic.
It was a disaster!
It is advisable to check for any possible adverse effects if you drink alcohol while taking the prescribed medication.
It's a child's game.
It's a good system.
It's all in the file.
It's all in the room.
We're all finished.
It's all over now.
That's all they talk about.
It's all very strange.
It's almost done.
It's almost midnight in Boston.
It's almost summer.
She's about to go.
It's really fun.
It's already seven o'clock.
It's already eleven o'clock.
It's already open.
It's a minor mistake.
It's a miracle you survived.
It's my honor.
There's nothing to think about.
It's too bad you ruined everything.
It's about integrity.
That's a reasonable compromise.
It's a false lead.
It's a risky plan.
Too bad the concrete doesn't burn.
It's a quick walk on foot.
It's just a job.
It's a special occasion.
It's a stupid rule.
It's a lovely idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
They broke it.
It's just a pain in the ass.
It's been raining for a week, more or less.
It's been three weeks since Tom moved to Boston.
It's been too long.
This week is exceptionally hot.
You'd better not talk so much.
It's better to be alone.
It's better to be an optimist and be wrong than to be a pessimist and be right.
"Better to die on your feet than to live on your knees". "Then why are you still alive?"
It's empty.
The sauna is here.
It's a new coin.
You scared me.
There's no one there.
It's closing time.
It's cold in here.
It's common knowledge that you don't love Tom.
It's dark in here.
It's deeper than that.
It's definitely them.
It's definitely Tom.
It's different now.
It's hard to judge his ability.
It's hard to explain.
It's a pain.
It's easier this way.
It's easier not to go to prison than to escape.
It's easy to see why people like Tom.
You can easily tell them apart.
I must have misjudged him.
It's her style.
It seems to me that's the only conclusion that can be drawn.
It looks very well written.
It's empty.
That's what you need.
It's a bad thing to swear.
It's exactly ten o'clock.
That's exactly what happened the other day.
It's very rare.
It's only fair.
It's a fair.
It's to protect you.
It's from the Bible.
It's funny
Watching TV is fun.
Get dressed
It's getting dark.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's going to be wild.
It's gonna get colder than it is.
It's going to happen soon.
It's good to see you all again.
It's good training.
It's good.
It's all better.
It's very funny.
It's happened before.
It's happening right now, isn't it?
It's hard to explain.
It's her.
It's hot in here in hell.
That should be possible.
This shouldn't take long.
I care what you think about Tom.
It is impossible for him to give up smoking.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
It's a safe place.
It's in great shape.
He's in the basement.
I'm just guessing.
It's just a question of time.
It's just made up.
He just sits there.
It's a little further up.
It's locked.
It's made of leather.
I call the shots, Tom.
It's my only hope.
It's nice and fresh.
It's nice and warm.
It's nice of him to bring such gifts.
It's nice to feel needed.
It's not a big deal.
It's not a big deal.
It's a little loud in here.
It's none of your business!
It's no secret that Tom doesn't agree with you.
It's not a high priority.
It's not a mistake.
It's not attractive.
It's not the other way around.
It didn't happen that way.
It's not gonna be easy to pull this off without a lot of help.
It's not hard to stand out when you're surrounded by idiots.
It's not a big deal.
It's not just a guess.
It's not a regular pen.
There's not enough light to read.
It's not like we're doing anything.
It's not my decision.
It's not my fault.
It's not necessary.
It's not absurd.
It's not that small.
It's not spring yet.
I'm not surprised.
It's not that deep.
It's not too early.
It's not up to you.
It's not often that someone buys a thousand-dollar hat.
It's not worth much.
It snowed last night.
Obviously a typo.
It's obvious to everyone that he's in love.
It's only a temporary solution.
Sounds like Tom.
That sounds pretty cool.
That sounds really good.
It's our job to help them.
Scrooge is white.
It is poison.
His presence is important to me.
It's probably hard.
It's probably true.
He probably still has it.
It's probably still available.
It's too deep.
It's actually quite common.
It's really good.
I could very well be wrong.
It's entirely possible that Tom won't help us at all.
It's really simple.
It's really exciting.
It's really gross.
It's a waste.
It's really weird.
It's red.
It's so wonderful.
It's so complicated.
It's a good one!
It's the law!
It's so obvious we don't need proof.
It's getting dark out there.
It's still dark outside.
It's still on sale.
It still works.
It's still not working.
It's still growing.
It's still there.
It's funny how people in the tropics eat spicy food like curry.
It's stuck in the water.
Its surface was as flat as a mirror.
It's time for that again.
This is the best pork chop I've ever tasted.
It's a spider's web.
I'm so scared right now!
It's time to get to work.
It's time to get up.
It's Tom's office.
It's too much.
It's too late for me to help you.
It's too risky to fight them in a place of their choosing.
He's a tough one.
It's shit.
Scrooz is wrong.
It can't stand the heat.
It's unique and irreplaceable.
It's not natural.
It's really hot.
I need to see Tom urgently.
It's very relaxing.
It's very simple to understand.
It's hot in here.
I'm guessing on purpose.
There's a wind.
It's work.
You lose.
It's your call, Tom.
It's yours.
It only takes three minutes to boil in the water.
It lasted all night.
It took a lot longer than I thought it would.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
You've turned out to be unexpectedly eloquent.
I turned the fan on and pointed it at the wall.
I turned on the light.
I turned off the TV.
I turned Tom down.
I was honored to be asked to give a talk.
It was so beautiful.
It was a shame.
It was after midnight.
This was an arena day.
It was a great show.
This was all my idea.
It was all right here.
It was all so easy.
It was an incredible night.
It was a setup.
It was a terrible sight.
It was an honor.
It was an offer I couldn't refuse.
It was a debt to spend the evening with a smart, witty, beautiful girl like you.
It was an extraordinary experience.
That was a surprise.
It was a wonderful experience.
It was a tough test.
It was a warm night.
It was a beautiful day.
It was a wonderful day.
It was a beautiful night.
Such behavior was childish on his part.
It was gross.
It was effective.
It was pretty funny.
It was too late.
It was for her.
It was from her.
It was one of them.
Yesterday was fun.
He was up late.
It was getting dark.
It was ironic.
It was my fault.
That was my suitcase.
It's nice of you to buy Tom such a nice present.
It was nice of you to let me stay here last night.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
It was not easy for me to admit my mistake.
It wasn't easy to solve this problem.
It didn't matter.
It wasn't my idea.
It wasn't very good.
It was pretty gross.
It has been shown that dogs that live on leeches jump higher than those that live on cats.
It was quite majestic.
It was pretty funny.
That was cheap.
It was really good.
It was really nice.
That was really nice.
That was really touching.
He was breathing heavily.
It was amazing.
It was necessary.
It was 7 and a half.
The day was so beautiful that we decided to go hiking.
It was so obvious.
It was this.
It was still there.
Tom gave me the picture that's hanging on the wall.
It was Tom.
It was too close.
It was pathetic.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
That was unseemly.
It was very generous of you to buy all this stuff for us.
It was very noisy in that room because all the windows were closed.
It was better.
It was worth a try.
It was your fault.
It's not gonna be okay.
It won't be enough.
I won't be lonely here.
It'll cost you nothing to fix it.
Lying won't help.
It's not gonna help.
Good work.
It would be very normal for you to be angry with Tom.
It wouldn't matter.
I'll talk to you tomorrow if I can explain everything to you.
I need you urgently.
I used to watch you.
I used to dream of being a ballerina.
I used to hate you.
I use it every day.
I use that computer.
I use this.
I already packed.
I've already read it.
I've already written everything that needs to be written.
I've already written my side of the report.
I've always admired Tom.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
I've always had someone to help me.
I always thought you were from Boston.
I've always wanted to get my hands on one of these.
I always wanted to live in a place like this.
I already asked everyone.
I asked Tom to help you.
I made a cake.
I baked them a cake.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
I was a little overwhelmed with something else.
I went all over town looking for Dom.
I've been through worse.
I was betrayed.
I was informed.
I've been robbed three times this month.
I rang the bell.
I was naive.
I was reckless.
I can't wait to meet him.
I've been gone for three weeks.
I was happy here.
I was helping.
I was helping them.
I was hired to find them.
I was kidnapped.
I've lived here for many years.
I've been looking for him for a while.
I've been pretty busy.
I've been looking for you for a while.
I've been learning French since I was thirteen.
I've been thinking about your problem with Tom.
I've been waiting for them for a while.
I've seen it before.
I came for them.
I came to bring him a gift.
I cut my finger.

Weren't you tired?
We are good.
We're old friends.
And we're headed for Boston.
We're out of gas.
We're playing a little too much.
We are exaggerating.
We're playing a computer game.
We're playing with the computer.
We're pretty good at this.
We're probably lying to each other.
We are ready to fight.
If you're ready to go, we're ready to go.
We are very angry.
We're really good.
We are in real danger.
We are sophisticated.
We feel sorry for you.
We're going to stay.
We are the best.
We're playing with fate.
We are the champions.
Were there any survivors?
We are Tom's parents.
We're trying to help him.
We're going back.
We are very efficient.
We're very pleased.
We're wasting time.
We're addicted to work.
Are you scared?
Were you home at ten?
Was he one of them?
We're your neighbors.
Was he sincere?
Was he sympathetic?
Did you see that?
Was he with anyone?
We wrapped the carpet.
We sat and waited.
We should ask him.
We should ask them.
We both have to go.
We should do this again sometime.
We should give him some time.
We should give Tom a chance to confess.
We should go home.
We have to help them.
We should let Tom get back to work.
We should have never let her go.
We weren't supposed to stay up till 2:30.
We need to set a trap.
We should have bought another bottle of wine.
We should have given up sooner.
We slept in a tent.
We spent the afternoon fooling around on the beach.
We started talking.
We're in the way.
We stayed up all night, trying to come up with a plan.
We still need a plan.
We still want to help.
We stole it.
We talked for two hours.
I think you can tell us where to find him.
We tried to get them to come.
We tried to get them to tell us.
We tried to hide it.
We get that.
We value our customers.
Neither of us was right.
We've all read that.
We've already cleared that.
We made them a cake.
We're about to start.
We're expecting her.
We were looking for them.
We've suffered a lot.
We were set up.
We tried.
We waited.
We were worried.
We both saw it.
We've discussed this.
We did everything we could for her.
We got a big day tomorrow.
We have one rule here.
We have something to show you.
We have the key.
We have to find him first.
We have to find him.
We have to find them first.
We have to get him in bed.
We need to get them to bed.
We have to give them something.
We have to help her.
We have to try it.
We had meetings.
We humiliated Tom.
We lost our faith in humanity.
We made mistakes.
We've met a few times.
We've only met each other once.
We saw aliens.
We visited the castles of the Loire.
We were waiting outside.
We walked through the trees.
We walk to school together.
We need a new carpet.
We wanted to talk about him.
We need more money.
We want to be famous.
We want to hear it.
We want to help him.
We want to help them.
We want to know about them.
We wanted to see him.
We want to see Tom.
We got out of there at 11:00.
We went to pick strawberries.
We went to the same church.
We all cheered for her.
We were all shocked.
We were both busy.
We didn't have a dime.
We were clearly confused.
We were 18 years old at the time.
We would have hung them.
We had a fight.
We were in a hurry.
We got here just in time.
We just came from over there.
We've been looking for you.
We didn't fight.
We weren't hungry.
They had more of them than we did.
I was a traveler.
We were playing golf.
We were ready.
We were very close.
Don't save the bell.
We were so worried.
We were so young then.
We got there first.
We were under attack.
We were worried about you.
We're having a discussion about the forecast.
We'll visit our brothers and sisters.
When we woke up this morning, we were confronted with terrible news.
We'd have fun if we went to the party.
