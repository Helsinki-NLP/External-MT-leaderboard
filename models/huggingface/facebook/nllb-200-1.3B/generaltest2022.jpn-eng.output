I don't want to watch TV anymore.
I'm not sure what you're talking about.
I watched the movie "The Eagle" on Netflix yesterday, and I've seen a lot of people laughing behind me when I say it's not particularly funny.
It's not funny, but it's not funny to laugh at everything you say because you're a salesman.
But if the staff doesn't laugh, the comedian's mood will be bad, and the work will be bad.
It's like the old black corporations, the industry is like a gym, and some of the entertainers have egos that are so gross that they're just not eating.
On the other hand, there are many arguments that the actor himself is not to be fooled by the difficulty of his work.
I know it's a pretty low income until you can sell it, but I'm always told that the entertainer's job is at the top of the stupidest of jobs.
It is only a glorification of one's own career and a justification for the way comedians are positioned in the media and society.

The sale of the Ibsen brush industry
Get your hairbrushes!
The buyer gets a sample.
I was given a free replacement for the stuff I ordered from the grocery store.
Summary: I ordered a radio mouse that was getting cheaper, and the wireless version of the mouse came in, and if you wanted a refund, you were told to return it.
I'm not talking about the PC, but it's more of a sales problem than a self-made PC, and I'm not sure how to explain it, and I'm a famous person, so I'll just write it down.
I started out by discovering that MSI's wireless gaming mouse was selling for 3,280 yen at the online shop's Tukumomo Day sale that started the previous Friday.
The store owner had the same price for the wireless version, and I checked the page for the wireless version, considering the possibility of a price error, and I ordered it because I thought it might not be a mistake.
I got a regular order, and I got a shipping the next day.
In these two emails, and in the purchase history of my page, the name CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS was written.
And I thought that, at this point, we'd get the wireless mouse we ordered, because we didn't have any error messages or cancellation notices before the order was shipped.
And that's where the problem came from, a few hours after the shipment, an email saying, "There was a mistake in the product registration".
According to the e-mail,
I was selling the radio version at a discount, but it was actually the online version.
* I'm already shipping the wire mouse
I'm not going to accept it.
Two, just return the mouse and get the money back.
Three, you use the wired mouse as it is.
Choose the answer to
And they're saying that they've got the wired and the wireless product pages, and they've got the wireless version on the purchase history, on the e-mail, on the delivery note, and they've just replaced the wired version.
If you want a refund, you can send it back to me.
I'm not going to take the money back, so I'm going to fight back.
If you were looking for a marriage or a partner, do you think you'd want to be with someone who doesn't have a relationship with your family?

Twice isolated... typhoon and heavy rain spill the only bridge connecting the district. Residents triple their food reserves.
Mr. Matsuno Hohoro, from the Highland District of the city of Yatsuma, Fukushima Prefecture.
The typhoon in 2019 in eastern Japan had a major impact on the lives of three families of eight people.
"At first, it's like 'really' or something".
The only road that connects the highlands to the Japanese city of Tokyo, the "Highlands Bridge", was flooded by the typhoon, leaving 11 families in the district isolated.
The residents, who were forced to cut off water, continued to carry their supplies for days using the JR iron bridge, which is normally off-limits.
"I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get out of the car and walk over the bridge, or if I'm going to be able to walk over the bridge and walk over the bridge, I'm going to be able to get out of the car and walk over the bridge".
After more than two years of the disaster, the recovery has progressed, but Matsumoto continues to take the necessary measures to learn the lesson.
I think there are about 10 cases.
"We have to find a way to save enough food for two or three days", he said. "We have about three times as much food in cans and cups as we had before the disaster.
Matsumoto Miyazaki: "I don't know when disaster will befall me, but I feel that it is better to save a little money".
In order to remember the lessons, we started our own initiative in 2021:
The head of the Yayoi-tachi Education Department and the first director of the Kawasaki-tōno department: "We have decided to set the date of October 12 as the 'Yayoi-tachi Disaster Prevention Day' and we want to consider the preparation for disaster prevention from next year.
I think we've gotten more and more aware of the unpredictable".

Be careful when buying a medieval home!
The "building status" trap is the one that's been around for years.
● The new "building situation survey" system to stimulate the market for second-hand housing is good.
The price of houses and apartments is rising, and the reform market is expanding.
The coronavirus crisis has also led to a rise in home ownership, and a sharp decline in the popularity of relatively cheap new buildings, which are represented by the words "station-front, station-near, station-straight", "large" and "tower".
However, the share of existing (old) housing in Japan is still low compared to other countries.
The Ministry of Land Transport and Infrastructure (MHT) has initiated an investigation called Inspection to improve the real estate law in 2018 and to conduct a survey of the condition of buildings aimed at the safe and secure trade of old houses.
This is a system whereby a resident architect checks the status and condition of the building, including its deterioration, and presents it to the buyer in a report.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs explains that the introduction of inspection has benefits for both buyers and sellers.
The seller can avoid claims after delivery by conducting an inventory inspection before the sale and sale transaction, and thus give the buyer a sense of security.
It also leads to the differentiation of competing goods.
On the other hand, it is also a system for the buyer to understand the condition of the proposed old house and convince him to buy it, and at first glance it is a system with great benefits.
The main authority in the current system is the seller.
I would also like to point out that the only obligation is to notify the inspection system.
So, the real estate agent who is in charge of the mediation is obliged to say, "You can refer an architect to the building inspection when you are in charge of the mediation" or "You can't", but the implementation itself is not obliged.
● The risks of seller-led inspections, while looking abroad, the US and UK, where the middle-market is booming, already have similar systems in place.
In the pre-sale phase, the buyer has a system whereby a specialist called an "inspector" or "building surveyor" is asked to inspect the building.
For example, in the United States, depending on the state, inspections are carried out in 70 to 90 percent of all second-hand home transactions.
In the sense that the "buyer" leads the inspection, the "seller" main Japanese type inspection and its nature are very different.
The seller will try to show the condition of the building as well as possible, sell it as high as possible and sell it as quickly as possible.
The buyer, on the other hand, wants to be safe and secure by studying the research and making the necessary repairs.
Even if the same inspection is carried out, both parties' intentions and goals are at odds.
The following are therefore highlighted as risks to be considered for the Japanese system:
• The scope of the state-mandated vendor-led inspections will be kept to a minimum;
The risk of missing out on a really important flaw is that it is not a detailed investigation.
So, you might have a "serious" inspection, not reporting any adverse findings to the seller.

I'm going to tell you something interesting about the Zodiac Beans.
You're going to the silver chair!
First dive into the Golden Seat.
When we walk in the zodiac, we are left with strange names, mysterious monuments, numerous companies, and the history of the zodiac.
I was walking with her on the bench, and I was suddenly silent, and I said, "This was a peninsula.
Was it a peninsula?
The name of the bustling city that created the "Golden Seat" in Japan, the "Golden Seat" in central Tokyo.
Originally, the term "Ginshō" referred to a silver-coin mint, but in 1612 the office of the Ginshō, which was located in what is now the city of Shizuoka, was moved to Edo.
At that time it was called "New Exchange Town", but when it was moved to the town of Oshkosh, it became known as "Gold Seat".
By the way, it is said that once upon a time, the area around the Golden Seat was a "peninsula" jutting out into the sea.
Before the Edo period, the Yangtze River flowed from the Nippon Valley to the circle, and from Japan Bridge to the Ginza, the peninsula called "Edo Pre-Island" stretched.
The tip of the peninsula is the present silver throne.
The Tokugawa clan opened a branch in Edo, built the Inuka River, and worked to improve the district of Kijima.
In addition, the family began to cultivate the land to improve the towns and improve the shipping industry.
And cut down the earth that had been cut down, and the mountains of Shinto, and planted the river.
The "Golden City" of the Bank of Japan is located in the central district of the city, and is located in the central part of the city.
The pilgrimage to the Holy Land.
The most famous pilgrimage to the temple is the "Ginshishi Octin" which is held every year.
Of the more than ten shrines, the most visible is the "Shine Shrine of Lightning" in front of the Kaobao Shinjō.
There are many people who attend the company that stands on the right side of the kabuki board before and after the theater.
On the other hand, "Lung Gok Inmotion" is on the roof of the Ginkgo House, "Ginkgo Birth Land" is on the Ginkgo Terrace on the ninth floor of the Ginkgo Three-Span Building.
The "Bow Boy Lighthouse" or "Adda Lighthouse" or "Toyoya Lighthouse" are located behind the road, and are hard to spot, but "Toyoya Lighthouse" is known for being revered by the famous Kaobao-kun, the city of Hanyu, and "Success Lighthouse" in the 1F Entrance of the Treasure House, is not open to the public except when it is around the 8th Lighthouse.
The temple is also used for worshiping the goddess of the moon, but most of the temples offer rice to the god.
The rice company, which is greeted by foxes in front of the temple, was built in the middle of the day, as farmers were more likely to benefit from the "grain rich rice".
This has led to the spread of religion in major cities such as Kyoto and Edo, and the rise of commerce and commerce in any busy city or financial center in Japan.

South Korean POSCO International acquires Senex Energy in Hubei and expands its gas field operations overseas
Posco International announced on 12 that it has signed a stock purchase agreement with Senex Energy of Hubei and an investment agreement to acquire Hancock Energy and Senex Energy.
The acquisition is expected to be completed in March next year, with the remaining procedures such as approval at the Senex Energy shareholders' meeting and approval of local legal entities.
The acquisition is the largest global M&A since the 2010 merger of POSCO International into the POSCO Group.
The purchase price was 77.09 billion won, of which Posco International decided to invest 50.1% and Hancock Energy 49.9%, respectively.
Posco International explained that it decided to buy the company because of the sustained increase in demand for natural gas even in the energy transition era, and the fact that the natural gas-based blue hydrogen is dividing the market with green hydrogen in the hydrogen market.
Posco International will also acquire 802 Bcf of natural gas reserves and land-based gas field operations in Hubei, equivalent to 44% of the 2019 natural gas consumption in South Korea.

Originally, February was only the 11th anniversary of the founding of the country, but now it is celebrated for 23 days because the emperor was born in February.

The knee pain, maybe "deformed knee arthritis"?
The first is that the disease is not a disease.
Editor: I've been having knee pain lately.
What are the possible diseases?
Dr. M.S.: The causes of knee pain are a variety of things, including injuries, rheumatism, and seizures.
Among them, the Japanese are more likely to have "deformed arthritis".
Editors: Does that mean the joint is deformed?
I'm not sure what you mean.
The surface of the joint is covered with cartilage, which acts to soften the impact and smooth the joint's movement.
However, age, obesity, and intense sports can cause cartilage to become smaller or more distorted.
And as a result, it causes joint deformity and inflammation.
Editors: Does this disorder affect other than the knee?
I'm not sure what you mean.
It can also occur in joints, ligaments, neck, waist, toes, hips, etc.
But the most common is in the knee, which is called "deformed knee arthritis".
Editors: What is the structure of the joints, first of all?
Dr. MURASANA: The joint is made up of two bones joined in a concave manner.
And the opposite sides of these two pieces are covered with cartilage, and the surrounding area is covered with a bundle.
Editors: It's a complicated structure, you know.
I'm not sure what you mean.
The inner layer of the articular sheath contains a tissue called the mucous membrane, which produces joint fluid.
This joint fluid, which acts as a lubricant, is composed of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfide.
That's why they say, "Hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfide are good for smooth knee movements".
Editors: What are the symptoms of deformed arthritis?
Dr. Mursam: The cartilage is sticky and elastic, and it's responsible for keeping bones from colliding with each other.
I mean, it's like a pillow.
But when it gets smaller or distorted, it can disfigure the joint, cause inflammation, and cause pain.

The third game in the Kaiji series is a real-life game.
The Kaji manga series, which is a popular gambling series with a male-centric focus.
One of the most fascinating aspects of the book is the extreme game of life.
I'm gonna be so tired of looking at the photos of you, I'm gonna have to cross the iron!
So this time I want to test the Kaiji game that can be played in real life or practiced in a project video.
■ The swamp is a trap-filled "swamp" featured in "The Gambling Covenant of Kaiji".
In the original, the high rate of 4,000 yen per ball surprised Kaiji.
This "swamp" was a "forest of nails", "a movable object", and "a three-stage clone" with a large trap, which was considered almost impossible to attack.
But Kaiji used all his hands and finally got out of the wilderness of putting a vinyl tank on the building and tilting the floor to sink, and he did it brilliantly.
The "Bamo" that appears in Kaiji actually appears as a patchinko and is played by many people.
Of course, it's not "4,000 yen a ball", and the difficulty is reduced, but you can taste the feeling of Kaiji.
The Iron Cross is a "human race horse" cross held by the rich at a "Starside Party" for the benefit of debtors including Kaiji.
The debtor walks, striving to avoid falling over the thin iron skeleton placed ten meters above the ground, and competes for his speed.
Twelve people are participating, the top two can win the prize, but the iron bones are only four, the safety measures are not enough, and the risk of death is quite high.
This iron bridge is dangerous, but it has been developed as a VR game and can be experienced very closely in the "Eagle Bridge" installed in the "Rakiten Life Park" at the base of the Pro Baseball and Tōkyō Rakuten Golden Eagles.
The Eagle Bridge is a 20 metre high iron bridge, preceded by the Sky Blanco and Victory Bridge, which are walkable.
Of course, there are security measures in place.
The comedian Koala Koostoru posted a video on his YouTube channel, where he described his walk on the Eagle Bridge as "a real experience in Japan".
E-card is a two-player card game.
The Emperor's card is played with one, the citizen's card with eight, and the slave's card with one, and the player is divided into the Emperor's and the slave's sides.
The game is very well done, with the characteristics of the emperor being stronger than the citizen, the citizen stronger than the slave, and the slave stronger than the emperor.
Kaiji fights against Liang Kawai in the drama with the strict rule "if you lose, you cut off your own ear".
After the war, Kaiji realized that the psychological reading was done by hearing devices that could destroy the ear, such as earphones, which were attached to the ear, and that they could detect and transmit pulse and body temperature changes. He cut his own ear to the limit and defeated Liang Kawai by making his body abnormal.
E-cards are available for purchase on Amazon.
On YouTube, popular YouTuber Hikal posted a video of him and his E-card rivalry, where he played Kaiji in the film.
■ Can you try the Kaiji?
It's not that we don't want to be in a situation like this, but it's true that when you read comics, you just want to feel it.
You might want to try to get a feel for the world through the game.
A step into the new year, a gentle push, a big picture of the county's patriotic shrine
The new year is coming to an end, and the next year, the big picture horse appeared in the prefecture's patron saint's office.
The students of the Toyotomi Art Institute, who designed the temple, visited the shrine on the 11th and held the consecration ceremony in front of the temple.
The company has been commissioning art students to paint a picture of a horse since last year.
This time, the work of three years of the Japanese painting course, drawn by nine people, was adopted by the artist.
The big picture horse is 3.3 meters wide and about 1.8 meters high.
The artist said that he painted "the image of cherry trees gently pushing the back of the new year".
He stopped and looked at the cherry blossoms, wishing that the tiger would "have the opportunity to admire the beauty of nature in a rapidly changing world".
The architect's designs are also depicted in the paintings that are widely distributed.
"I think all people will help us to overcome difficulties", said Chiba Hsin-i of the Kotogawa-shi (Kotogawa-shi) party.

I'm going to suggest that you think about Yūno, the city's fourth high school student workshop: Yūno Digital News
What kind of town is Yano in 2030?
The representatives of the students of four high schools in Yūno City are working together on a workshop to think about "Yūno I want to live with".
As part of the research and policy proposals of the Yūno SDGs Development Center, a central support organization, we will gather the voices of young people and make recommendations to mayors.
"When is it fun?"
The facilitator's questions are answered in the form of "When I'm in a crowd" or "When I want to play the drums".
The first was held at the Sunrise Hall on November 13.
The World Cafe method, where 18 high school students and local people travel to a theme island and talk about "a fun town", "a liveable town", "a town that feels alive".
Each idea is written on a sticker and pasted on a molded paper.
"It's fun to live in a town with a lot of young people", "It's easy to live in a town with a lot of trains and buses".
We'll talk about it later.
"I thought Yūno was boring, but the attraction of being able to cycle along the beach", says a third-year student of Yūno Commercial High School.
The school's student, a junior, said: "There are few shops, traffic is not convenient, but the natural environment is good".
The second time in December, only high school students gathered and prepared their proposals.
I'm going to invite the mayor and the head of education to announce it in February.
The center's director, Tondo Ige, said that "as well as fostering the love of the homeland among high school students, it is an incentive for young people to be involved in the local community".
The quake's magnitude is 4.0 in Kanton, and the epicenter is south of the city of Itz.
On the 12th, at around 0:31 pm, there was a magnitude 4 earthquake in the provinces of Tsatsui, Tsuchi, Goma and Yujia.
According to the Meteorological Agency, the epicenter is in the south of the city of Itza, and the depth of the epicenter is about 50 kilometers.
The magnitude of the earthquake is estimated to be 5.0 on the Richter scale.
I'm not worried about the tsunami.
The earthquakes in the various regions are as follows:
The earthquake was recorded at the site of the first earthquake in the year of the Japanese invasion of Japan.

How to find a new wrapper in a store
It's a must-have in winter, but don't you have time to put a cloth around your neck?
I can look in the mirror and balance it after I've wrapped it, but I hear a voice saying, "I don't know what it is".
If I thought I had a stall that didn't have any rags, that could be wrapped around, I'd find something new.
The stalls of the brand "COTTORI" have a length of about one meter and a compact size feel than the usual ones.
When I first saw it, I thought, "How can you wrap it that short?"
It is a very fine piece of cloth, and it is made in one piece, and it is all in the shape of a net.
The net is made to allow the edge of the store to pass through.
So you can keep it wrapped up without connecting the ends.
It's made of fried stuff, very light and warm.
This year, the popularity of the jacket is also the sleeveless vest, but many people will wear it in combination with the stall so that the shoulders do not get cold.
I think it's a good idea to have a store like this.
I'm not going to be able to do this.
I'm having a really fun Beatles documentary coming to Disney Plus.
I'm doing a movie called Get Buck, directed by Peter Jackson.
It's like the Beatles, it's like the Beatles, it's like the Beatles, it's like the Beatles, it's like the Beatles, it's like the Beatles, it's like the Beatles, it's like the Beatles, it's like the Beatles, it's like the Beatles, it's like the Beatles, it's like the Beatles, it's like the Beatles, it's like the Beatles, it's like the Beatles, it's like the Beatles, it's like the Beatles, it's like the Beatles, it's like the Beatles, it's like the whole whole whole thing.
I'm just doing a giggles, because I'm just breaking up, and it's not the dramatic giggles I imagined.
Or Paul, the grumpy, who's trying to do things, and says, "I know I'm a jerk, but I'm a jerk!" or George, who's a jerk, and says, "But I'm a jerk!" or John, the calm, late, and unmotivated, who's always joking, and doesn't even actively suck the apple, and sits behind me with a face like, "I'm in trouble".
I don't think we hated each other enough to fight, but there was a certain feeling that we couldn't work together anymore, and that the Beatles were like that, and it's kind of a funny breakdown of the legend.
And when we started playing in that atmosphere, everybody was really talented.
It's a crazy process, from a little phrase like, "How about this?" to a little song like that.
Especially when the headline "Get Buck" comes out.
It's amazing how the whole thing is recorded, and the whole thing is recorded, and the whole thing is recorded, and the whole thing is recorded, and the whole thing is recorded, and the whole thing is recorded.
I don't want to be seen doing this.
And, of course, everyone's so busy, and I'm happy just watching the performance.
It's one of three stories, but I think the biggest reason for the break-up was probably the environment around them, not the Beatles themselves.
And I'd be happy to do it, but when I was talking about where we'd play, it was easy to see that the producers and the publicity people were just saying, "Oh, the Beatles are the best in the world!" and they were getting away from the band.
Well, the documentary has the director's interpretation, so maybe Peter Jackson felt that way.
And I thought maybe that's why Paul was the bad guy so much, because he was the supervisor.

I was a salesman, but I was sick to death and I changed jobs, and I was having a hard time doing my own sales work at the time, but I thought I was doing the best I could for the business that my customers needed, and it was a different kind of work, and I was able to do it, and it was a lot easier.
I've been told I can't do things, but I think if I can find something good in myself or something I can do, then life will be a little easier in the future.
I think we should think about this after we've had a little rest and a little relaxation.
I think it's just that there's a lot of everyday life, so if there's a union or an industrialist or a window where you can consult, and you're being consulted, there's some kind of system or something, you might want to try it once.
I hope you'll be able to live a little bit easier in the future.

The United States has been hit by a series of tornadoes, which have caused massive damage due to the unseasonably hot and cold weather.
From Friday night to Saturday night, 10 to 11 local time, tornadoes hit the southern United States.
The atmosphere was very unstable and the clouds appeared to have developed rapidly, due to the effects of the strong cold southward, which was a record warmth for this period.
In the southern United States, warm air from the southwest has reached record high temperatures.
In Houston, Texas, the highest temperature of the day, Thursday and Friday, is approaching 30 degrees Celsius.
At this record warm point, at 5500 m above sea level, the southernmost extreme cold of the year was below 30 °C. The large temperature difference caused the formation of an active front and the rapid development of clouds along the front line.
There seems to be a series of tornadoes in the area.
Although the southern United States is a tornado-prone area, the high season is early summer, and not much damage is reported during this time.
The number of tornado warnings issued in one day during the winter reached almost 150, a record number.
The U.S. Meteorological Agency reported more than 400 tornadoes and typhoons in just 10 days, local time.
This shows that there are two concentrated areas, the southern line from Kentucky to Texas and the northern line, which includes Illinois.
In Kentucky, the tornado's EF scale (Improved Fuda Scale) is the third strongest of the six, with an EF3 and a momentary sustained wind of 70 m/s.
The results of the study suggest that the test may be EF4+5.
In Japan, the JEF (Japanese version of the Fudōda scale) is used, which is based on the Fudōda scale and is adapted to the situation of Japanese architecture.
The equivalent of this American tornado, JEF3, is likely to occur in Japan, and is at the level of collapsing wooden houses.

New game.
The first time a tornado hit the U.S. was in the midst of the "biggest ever" tornado.
President Biden described the tornado's damage in the Midwest and South as "one of the largest in U.S. history" and "a strange sight".
CNN and other news outlets reported:
Biden stressed that "as a federal government, we will do everything we can".
"We don't know the full extent of the damage yet, or how many lives were lost", he explained.
The death toll has risen to over 100 people.
In Kentucky, which was hit by the tornado, more than 30 tornadoes hit at least six states, including Kentucky, between the night of 10-11 and the people carrying household items from their destroyed homes.
The record for the tornado's damage range is 219 miles, which was recorded in 1925 in Missouri, but CNN forecasts that it was the largest this time around, at 250 miles.
In Mayfield, Kentucky, which was badly damaged, a candle factory was also severely damaged, which was operating 24 hours a day in preparation for the Christmas trade war.
110 people were working at the time, but the building was destroyed and left without a trace.
In the dark, under a 1.5 meter thick ditch, a woman, unable to move, felt the weight of the rescue workers searching over the ditch and called for help via Facebook live broadcast from her mobile phone.
The live broadcast, which was released, included screams and another woman's song "Happy Birthday to You", which is believed to have been sung while crying to distract from the fear.
Amber Brown, a convenience store owner in Mayfield, was safe in her basement with her five-year-old son because of a tornado warning.
"Many people likened it to the sound of a train, but it was more like a terrifying earthquake, like something was about to explode".
Mayfield Police officers said they would continue searching until it was no longer necessary.
"I don't know how many weeks, months or years it will take", continued the hard-working rescue operation.
In Illinois, a warehouse of the Internet giant Amazon collapsed, killing at least six people.
The train is blocked by a shock that can cause the vehicle to break off, and the highway is blocked by the impact of a vehicle falling.

It has long been said that we have different ideas about the rating system of the star system.
While other countries are taking five stars as a benchmark, Japan is claiming to be neutral and adding or subtracting three stars.
At the point of reference, there is already a difference of two stars, and four stars have a "minus point element" and "not a masterpiece but a masterpiece" have a completely different meaning.
If you give five stars, you're going to get "the best in everything" and "the best in everything", and if you have that tendency, I think it's a systemic flaw that doesn't give you a star, but I'm not saying you should give three stars because that's how the system is run.

The best food is the "hakobune" "Fish fries and seafood fries from the seas" in the "Living and culture" section of the Sago newspaper
Lunch: fresh fish fries caught near the sea and ebony fries, homemade tartar sauce.
The food is served in a variety of dishes, including vegetables and deli take-out specialties.
"So that you can enjoy the restaurant feel at home", said Mr. and Mrs. Hashimoto, who opened the restaurant last August.
One of the popular menus for the lunch is "Fish fries and ebony fries from nearby seas, homemade tartal sauce".
Fish choose the good stuff at the market.
"Fry is a dish that is made with raw bread flour as thin as possible so that you can taste the ingredients".
The meal consists of four kinds of vegetables and deli, along with rice and cereal dishes and soups made from Hinokikari, a variety of Sagoan cuisine.
The vegetables are made in the neighboring fields or in the provincial direct sales.
The side dishes change with the seasons, but she has a French background, and adds flavor to the dishes such as lapis lazuli and ratatouille.
On the other hand, she combines the "eaten-in-the-court relaxing taste" of rolling eggs with the "sweetness" enjoyed by a wide range of generations.

General review. Not bad, but there was still room for improvement.
It is a pity that it is easier to use if you take care of it with fewer people or if you let them come to the edge.

A man was stabbed and fled on a male motorcycle 12 days ago, attempted murder in the city of Sago
On the 12th, at about 1:25 am, a 40-year-old man in Fukuoka Prefecture was cut with a knife by a man who appeared to be 30 to 40 years old, and injured his face on the first street of Sago City.
The man escapes on a motorbike, and the Sago Southern Police Department is pursuing him as a case of attempted murder.
According to the South Station, the passenger said "struggling" in the 110 number.
The man has a wound about 10 centimeters long and about one centimeter deep on his left thigh, but he is conscious.
The man who escaped was skinheaded.
There were knives left near the scene that were believed to have been used in the crime.
The man is believed to have been drinking with several acquaintances, and is investigating whether there was any traffic problem between the pedestrian and the man on the bike.

The long journey of a family that has rooted environmental activism in China's borders.
China, with its vast landmass, is also important for biodiversity, with the world's largest number of mammals and the third largest number of plants.
Some local authorities recognize the value of biodiversity and promote environmental activists' activities, as well as the protection of the environment by local authorities.
The southwestern province of Yunnan, Sichuan, is one such region.
Her sister, Li Yue, is an actress. Sisapanna is a region bordering Laos and Myanmar, where many ethnic minorities live, including the "Thai" people, who share roots with the Thai people of the Kingdom of Thailand.
The Mekong River, which flows through Southeast Asia, is the source of the river.
Sisapanna Thai Autonomous Region Sisapanna covers only 0.2% of China's total area, but is home to about 25% of wildlife and 20% of plant species.
This time, I'm going to tell you about the activities that I saw and experienced with Mr. Li Zhongguo, who is an environmental activist in Sisapanna.
■ Started environmental protection with my German husband - - Started environmental protection for 20 years
What was the motivation?
Mr. Li, our environmental protection campaign "Shanghai" started its activities in 2000.
My husband, Josef Margraf, was the inspiration.
My husband is from Germany and came to Sisapanna for a joint UN-China science project.
This is the only rainforest region in China that boasts a significant biodiversity.
But, on the other hand, economic development was lagging behind.
So, to establish industry in the region, and to produce rubber that was scarce in China, large-scale deforestation was carried out.
My husband was sent here from Germany to study the recovery of natural resources and biological resources.
And then they met and married me, who was a reporter here.
- Before that, Lee wasn't interested in conservation?
Mr. Lee, I'm from Sisappana, but I wasn't interested in the importance of rainforests or the significance of biodiversity.
So I had to push my husband and the project without that knowledge.
I see people who don't have a good face, who don't have a great height, but who have an aura, and I wonder why.
And I'm not going to say, "I'm not going to do this".
Aura is not the one who's going out.
"It's a natural thing to come out of a moment of self-confidence.
He's got a lot of confidence in himself.

I've never been told to praise a detail, so I don't know what it means.
I'm not sure I've ever been complimented.
What if you confess to Yoko Ono?
"I have confessed to Sakura, my heart is full of spring, here it is, please", he replies, and they are in a relationship.
And to get together, we want to learn more about golf and share what we like about each other.

The first time that a person's memory of a brain tumor was linked to CTD in their environment, it took about a month and a half to confirm.
The data, which were stable until March, did not take much time to play since GW, and CTD due to multiple factors occurred, and it took a very consistent amount of time to look at it a little bit at the holiday center only.
Why didn't you parse the logs in the Net Script Framework?
The timing of the main CTD
* all papyrus and .Net Script Framework.dll plug-ins of the type that leave logs without leaving traces in the logs
* Some NPC kill/attack accumulation: starting at the console kill→Essentials be Gone (SKSE plug-in/ powerofthree SE update re-opening version) OFF improvement This is possible wetsuit?
* The camera working time of a kill move against a certain NPC→ Basic improvement in OFF setting of a kill move by PC via .ini: setting competition in the DAR+Nemesis relationship?
* (basic outdoor) field movement + some magic (example: ice-cream) start, NPC life time: Dirt & Blood v 2.0 SPID use NPC application setting (top right of MCM) all off 5 consecutive trials all improved
Is it due to a shader configuration error for some actor/NPC wear? Still, 2.0 SPID usage default.ini has a written error but the result is intended result and the NPC should be applied to the premise Perk
At first, I focused on checking the motions/fighting MODs (the ones on .dll) for side-attacks and OnHit relationships, but the result was this:
I don't think there were any similar bug reports, at least not at the English, German or French level.
I asked them to post it, hoping that if anyone has similar CTD problems in Japanese, it might be a good reminder.
And they're all doing it in a mental state.
People don't notice it, not even their coworkers or their family.

But he's probably a bit of a mental wreck.
I'm not retired mentally, but I think I was on the edge just before retirement.
I'm not going to go into detail about the importance of psychiatric visiting nurses.
I have been a long time visiting nurse because I have bipolar disorder, but I think I have a long and very good relationship with the nurse at the visiting nursing station I am using now.
I'm going to tell you a lot of stories every week.
Of course, they do the medication management, but I think the most important thing is that today's visiting nurses will show you how important pleasant communication is for people with mental illness.
Today we are talking about the gender gap, or the gender theory.
They talk about sexual desires, or why she got divorced, or why we should do that as a visiting nurse.
Sometimes I even dress up as a woman.
I have heard people say that in the case of visiting nursing stations run by psychiatric hospitals, the nurse who is not able to work in the ward comes and only takes care of the administrative work, or that the visiting nurse is an occupational therapist and they point out from above, "Because I am doing medicine".
I'm using a small visiting nursing station run by a social service agency, but I think she's a really good nurse who's on par with me and Frank, who has a mental illness.
By the way, she's beautiful.
Some of you are going to be in psychiatric care, and some of you are thinking about it.
Visiting nurses are very helpful for people with mental illness.
If the doctor says yes, I'll take it.
And then, pick a good visiting nursing station.
I've had to cancel contracts before because I didn't want to.
I'm sorry about that.
I know it's a false alarm, but it's in English and I'm scared.

The South Korean patent on hydrogen technology, one-fifth of China's ... "Late in the implementation of the hydrogen roadmap".
The South Korean government has released a 2019 hydrogen roadmap.
The plan was to introduce 65,000 fuel cell vehicles by 2022 and operate 310 hydrogen stations across the country.
The target price for hydrogen was set at 6,000 won per kilogram.
But fuel cell vehicles are only 27 percent of the target (about 17,000) by November.
The hydrogen station deployment schedule of the core infrastructure is also 38 percent of the target (about 117 places) and the price of hydrogen per kilo is 8400 watts, which is not much different from the time the road map was announced.
The government's hydrogen roadmap has been well below its target.
The National Federation of Economists (FNA) on 12th December published a report entitled "The state of the hydrogen economy and its policy orientation".
The report says that the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry are largely dependent on the United States and Japan.
The core material for fuel cell vehicles is carbon fiber, which is supplied by Tōre (Japan), platinum catalyst by Kinsella (Japan), and membrane membrane by Dupont (USA), Goa (USA) and 3M (USA).
The number of hydrogen technology patents in the six countries that dominate the world hydrogen market (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea and Germany) has increased by an average of 14% per year (since 2014).
Korea ranks fifth in the world in terms of patents in the field of hydrogen production and fuel cell production.
But the whole team said that "the fact that six countries actually have the majority of the world hydrogen market means that they are actually in the bottom of the competitive list".
The ranking by country is China, the US, the EU and Japan.
Since 2017, when China overtook the United States to become the first, the gap has widened.
The number of registered patents in 2020 is the fourth highest in South Korea with 1033 patents, surpassing Japan (974), but at the level of China (4721).
The National Council of Ministers proposed that hydrogen technology should be designated as a 'National Strategic Technology' with a large deduction of equipment investment and research and development costs.

Congress on Sunday?
The creation of a TV show-style "Chirashi" in the form of a parliamentary reform in the form of a falconry, and the "mailbook" of the congressman: Hokkaido newspaper, electronic version of the "Hachin"
The town council of Khakamatsu is working on a unique parliamentary reform, such as the creation of a unique signpost to guide the regular meetings and the introduction of a "communication book" where the townspeople evaluate the members.
The aim is to get the townspeople interested in the town council elections, which are held without a vote for three consecutive terms.
To inform the Sunday Parliament, held on the 12th, about 1800 copies of the new edition were distributed in newspaper folding on the 9th.
The first book in the series is called "The Morning After", "The Philosopher's Room", "The Swallows and Amazons", "The Swallows and Amazons", "The Swallows and Amazons", "The Swallows and Amazons", "The Swallows and Amazons", "The Swallows and Amazons", "The Swallows and Amazons", "The Swallows and Amazons", "The Swallows and Amazons", "The Swallows and Amazons", "The Swallows and Amazons", "The Swallows and Amazons", "The Swallows and Amazons", "The Swallows and Amazons", "The Swallows and Amazons", "The Swallows and Amazons", "The Swallows and Amazons", "The Swallows and Amazons", "The Swallows and Amazons", "The Swallows and Amazons".

US aid weapons and ammunition arrive in Ukraine, and troops are also training.
(CNN) U.S. Department of State officials reported that within 12 days, equipment including small arms and ammunition had arrived in Ukraine under a security assistance plan approved by President Biden.
The military assistance will amount to 60 million yen, and by the beginning of the year the last equipment, including four radars to identify launch points such as mortars, will be transported to Ukraine.
According to a spokesman for the US Department of Defense, these aid measures included lethal weapons such as the Javelin anti-tank missile.
The military support is aimed at strengthening the Ukrainian national defense capability, which includes the military strengthening received by the Russian forces in the vicinity of the Ukrainian border.
The US has increased its vigilance against Russian military movements, consulted with NATO members, and prepared a response to Russia's aggression against Ukraine.
President Biden approved arms aid when President Zelensky of Ukraine visited the White House on September 1 this year.
The US military assistance to Ukraine this year has reached about $450 million.
Since Russia's forced annexation of the Ukrainian Crimea, the total amount of aid has exceeded $2.5 billion.
The US military also engages in training missions for the Ukrainian military.
Last month, the US sent troops from Florida to Ukraine in accordance with a multi-national joint training plan to support Ukraine.
According to a statement by the US Department of Defense, US Special Operations Forces in Europe play a major role in training and advising the Ukrainian special forces.
The number of US special forces operating in Ukraine is not disclosed as a matter of operational secrecy.
President Biden had an online meeting with Russian President Putin on 7th of this month, but there was also a tense exchange over the situation in Ukraine.
The United States is also prepared to impose severe economic sanctions if an invasion occurs.

The "review" of the inheritance and gift tax, which makes the gift "forbidden" before life, directly hit the former chairman of the tax commission of the Ghanliming and SDP!
The first feature in the December 18 issue of "Diamond Weekly" is "Family Talk at the End of the Year!"
"Giving and inheriting before you die".
While the debate on the unification of inheritance tax and gift tax is ongoing, it is likely that in the near future, the legacy tax anti-tax road, the gift of life, will be "forbidden".
How will the rules of inheritance change?
With a direct hit to the former chairman of the tax committee of the SDP, Ghanli Mumin House of Representatives, he will teach the basic keys of gifts and inheritance for timely and lucrative induction gifts within the year, from the key to tax saving techniques.
I'm not sure what you're talking about.
● "Prohibiting" the use of lifetime gifts from property owners to city employees "to pursue a serious consideration towards the construction of a tax system that is neutral in the choice of the time of transfer of assets from the point of view of taxing inheritance tax and gift tax more uniquely".
The party's 2021 tax reform package, announced last year, has caused a great deal of uproar, not only among the wealthy but also among the middle class.
Because what they are saying is that they are trying to change the rules of inheritance and make the "life gift" a "forbidden hand" by making the royal method of inheritance taxation a "forbidden hand".
The key to the tax-reduction measures for the progressive inheritance tax is to "reduce the taxable property".
The most powerful of these is the lifetime endowment, which has been widely used by wealthy people, and of course, by company employees who have a small inheritance tax due to their home in the tri-city area.
The debate about the "unification of inheritance tax and gift tax" arose in the midst of this.
Although the 22nd Annual Tax Reform Agenda of December 10th, which was concerned about the fastest introduction, was sent, "Revising the existing inheritance tax system and the calendar year gift system". The policy was again launched with more step-by-step statements towards integration, such as "The non-taxation of gift tax measures is a system that does not require any tax burden on the transfer of assets within the family within the limits of the limitation period.
In an interview with the editorial department, the former chairman of the tax investigation of the SDP, former chief executive of Ghan Lim says:
"It is most important to avoid the loss of the advantages and disadvantages of the time of the transfer of property and to keep the same tax burden whenever you go.
"We're simulating what kind of problems will come out of this". The quickest fix is three chances of a lifetime gift.
Even if it is not, it is not wrong to make a big move towards the abolition of lifetime grants as a tax-saving measure in the near future.
So how exactly do the rules for inheritance tax and gift tax change?

"My Right Big Brother" will be aired on January 10, 2022 on the air.
The FOD original drama "My Right Brother" starring Hokage Kugawa has been decided to be broadcast on Fuji TV from late night on January 10, 2022.
The film is based on Moriyatsu's manga of the same name, which has been serialized in the manga magazine BE-LOVE since 2018. The story is a love story of a man and a woman who bear the past.
The main character, Hailey, is played by Gokuwa, and the heroine, Rishi, is played by Futao Yuki.
A college student meets a part-time employee named Hayley.
Hailey, who is daily plagued by insomnia, is a mysterious young man who can sleep soundly on the shoulders of the ruler.
Rishi is attracted to Hairy, who looks like his brother, who was separated from his parents after their divorce, but somehow Hairy is a murderer.
The drama "My Rightful Brother" will be broadcast on the ground from January 10!
For those of you who haven't seen it on FOD, I hope you'll be able to see it in more depth, and for those of you who have, I hope you'll be able to see the complex psychological portrayal of Hailey and Rishi, and the two men's struggle and change.
I'm glad you enjoyed the original.
I'm sure you'll be pleased.
I'm a beautiful woman, and I'm comfortable.
And you're warming up from the inside out with a natural warmth.

The team that won the NFL game with three passes for one game, how did the players feel?
This game, Jones threw three passes -- Patriots passes only three times.
That's the fewest passes in the NFL in 50 years since the Bills' two passes against the New York Jets in Week 3 of 1974.
The 1974 Bills had a late-breed genius RB named O.J. Simpson, who had surpassed 2,000 yards in a season for the first time in franchise history the previous season.
The Bills had overpowered the Jets with a run by Simpson and another RB, Jim Braxton.
The weather was the main reason the Patriots launched such an extreme offense this time.
Buffalo is a town near the Canadian border, and its latitude is not the same as the North Shore corridor.
And then, on this day, after the temperature had risen by almost one degree Celsius, the wind was blowing at 18 meters, and before the match there was a snowstorm.
The Bills are local and haven't changed much in their play.
He's got 30 passes and 25 runs.
Allen's pass is 15-30 and 145 yards.
There was no intercept, and it was never impossible.
In 10 offensive series, there were four Red Zone intrusions and a scoring system.
Especially after the end of the third quarter, we've made it to the red zone three times in a row.
But I only got three points in one FG.
The defense in the final quarter.
The Bills, who were four points behind, took a penalty on 3rd and 9th, and finished 3rd and 14th.
18 yards to the goal.
At 3rd and 14th, QB Allen, surrounded by the Patriots defense rush, slipped out of his pocket and into the right.
And then he threw a pass to T.E. Dawson Knox in the end zone, but he failed.
In this play, Stephen Diggs, who was outside on the right, ran the Shallow-Acros and was free in front of the end zone, but it seems that Allen didn't see it.
4th & 18th Allen was aiming for WR Gabriel Davis, who ran out of the end zone on the left, but the pass was blown by Patriots' DB Miles Bryant in front of him.
Bryant was wearing a man-to-man cover for Bill's WR Cole Beasley, and he saw Allen's movements along the way, dropped Beasley and reacted to the pass.
Allen missed two receivers, and both times he threw passes to the end zone.
The fourth down may have been a draw, but the third down didn't have to go for TD.
We're going to take the first down in two plays.
It was only two minutes before the fourth and short, and Allen's ability to run his own home run would have been alive.

It's time to throw away and replace three items that have been in the kitchen for a long time.
Sponge, please.
No matter how often you replace it, it's probably not as often as recommended.
A 2017 study found that even if a kitchen sponge is sterilized with an e-ray every day, it can still produce a lot of bacteria.
The German researchers who conducted the study recommend changing the sponge once a week to keep it clean.
The board.
The United States Department of Agriculture suggests that if you start to scratch, or if you have a wound or a gap, you should replace the board.
Once the wound and groove progress, it becomes difficult to keep clean, and bacteria multiply.
If you are still feeling well, don't forget to disinfect the water with a glass of table spoonful of unscented liquid bleach.
The surface of the plate is soaked in liquid and left for several minutes.
Then, dry it in clean water, or dry it naturally, or cut it into a paper towel and dry it.
I'm not sure what you're looking for.
It may be a pain to dispose of your favorite mug, but the missing surface is a new hotbed for bacteria and microorganisms.
It can also cause a cutting of the lips or spilling of the drink.
Yeah, this is your chance to buy a new favorite mug!

The water is the only thing that's allowed.

If you're a stranger and you don't care, you should just say you're uncomfortable.

I was living abroad, but the Japanese who went abroad, including me, sometimes mistakenly thought that people who came up there who were disgusted by the traditional practices of the upper and lower classes, were out of touch or could say anything to the locals.
If you look like a Western, you're not just being mean, you're being kind of sweet or funny.

I have only a limited knowledge of English, so I judge only by the translated text.
I think the translated text is a little bit off, but I understand what I'm trying to say, and I think it's a level that's not too difficult to play.
I've seen this level of translation in games made overseas, and I feel like it's a good level of translation for a small company.
I think that a non-native Japanese speaker can understand the nuances of Japanese even if he studies for a long time.
I don't know what level you want, but if you want a level where the Japanese don't feel any discomfort, I think you should look elsewhere.

Well, I live three kilometers away from home, and I go to my friend and he says, "Well, why don't you live with me?"

And why doesn't it make sense to move closer to home?

What do you want to do first when you move to Fog Island Hot Springs?
After entering the hot spring, I eat beer while I'm in the bathroom, and then I drink local wine while I'm cooking.
The battle is the practice of the "Destruction Blade".
"The exchange of effort is the praise of humanity".
The most striking feature of the recent children's comic strip is that it is "a lot of practice".
It is generally accepted that a practice that does not have a battle and that practices even in the early morning and evening are not popular with readers.
It was a two-year practice, but I could tell from the fact that I was just drawing a touch and the rest was flying away with luxury, when one piece of wheat was left out in the same jump comic "ONE PIECE".
Well, one of the charms of the Wandi is the eccentricity of the terrain they walk through, and "stay in one place" is not always the right fit.
The practice of the main character of "Ghost's Sword" - Anjiroji began when he sat down and begged the life of the hero who saved his life, Yukiya Yukiya, who tried to take his own life, and he said to the hero, "Do not let others have the right to kill and take your life!"
The weak have no rights, no choice, only to be subdued by the strong.
It was the gentleness of the brave that introduced the "cultivator" Chihiro Kawasaki, who trained the aspirants of the Ghostbusters.
The first contact between the two was when he was asked, "What do you do when your sister eats people?"
It's a bit of a rambling, unreasonable conversation between fans.
But taking your ghostly sister with you, it's a possibility that the moment may come when you'll have to make that decision.
It is the initiation into the practice of the mind.
But he took the charcoal-cutter, a Dōshin, who had not yet practiced, to the narrow misty mountain, and told him to come down to the mountain's slope before dawn, and he would fall down.
The mountains are full of pitfalls, pitfalls, and pitfalls, and the air is thin, and they die before they enter the practice.
But he still has a keen sense of smell, and he can barely smell the slight smell of a human-made monkey, or avoid it in any way.
But it's not like you're suddenly so physically strong that you can avoid it all!"
Ordinary people don't suddenly become strong without any support, and they only wake up to use "the power and skill that they've honed so far" to their true potential.
The "equal exchange of effort" - which rewards the person who has made the effort a little, or nothing for the effort he has not made - is a human hymn, different from the ghost with unfounded supernatural powers, and is a hard-to-manipulate rule consistent with the work.

And you're the one who works as a partner, and you're the one who wants to work full time, and you're the one who's working as a partner.
No, I don't think so, not at all.
I don't think that's a hard one to do.
I think it's "difficult" to try to get more out of the minimum amount of work.

Samsung Electronics in South Korea has created a new "DX" division that integrates home and mobile, "emphasizing user experience".
Samsung Electronics announced on 12 that it will continue to integrate the CE and IM divisions into set divisions, and that it will name itself DX (Device eXperience), reflecting this in its end-of-year organizational restructuring.
The aim is to enhance user experience through a variety of services, from mobile to home appliances.
Samsung Electronics has announced that the newly formed DX division will be formed from the divisions of Visual Display, Home Appliances, Medical Devices, Mobile eXperience, and Network.
Samsung Electronics explained that "the name change reflects the medium-term business structure and future orientation, as well as strengthening global leadership".
He added that products such as televisions, home appliances, smartphones and communication devices, of course, emphasized the desire to make it easy for consumers to enjoy an optimized experience through service solutions that reflect the needs of customers.
The launch of the integrated leadership system reflects the strategy of creating synergies across the company and building a differentiated product and service base, beyond the boundaries between organizations.
Samsung Electronics is already planning a strategy to enable users to freely access content and services through the interconnection of devices, such as home appliances and smartphones, based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI), through the "Multi Device Experience" Council.

I've also helped with Kickstarter and I've been working on a Japanese translation of the book.
I have a problem with taste, but I don't think "desu/masu style" is appropriate for a natural science documentary where a man with a low voice takes the narrator.
I'd like to see a more serious and tough version of it.
> They lie, jaws primed, with only their armored heads visible from the sand... anything that stumbles into their pit is speared and dragged below.
> The honeybee larvae lie in wait in the sand to catch their prey at any time, showing only their disc-shaped heads to the sand.
This is a little unnatural.
The honeybee's young lie in wait in the sand, peering out of the sand only at its disc-shaped head, so that it can catch its prey at any time.
I think it should be.
What I'm worried about is
* I'm not sure I've seen any other documentaries
* See it from the ant's point of view
I mean, I don't know.
And you'd think that if you translated armoured heads into the word "disc-shaped head", you'd be missing the part where "the ant-scale monster is a giant with a beak".
The driver of the trailer is unconscious.
In the case of the collision of 24 cars in the city of Koizumi, Aichi Prefecture, it was found that the driver of the arrested and sent to the check-in trailer was not ill and it was believed that he had caused the accident due to some negligence.
On the morning of the 10th, 24 trucks and passenger cars collided on the 41st National Road in Choi Pao City, injuring 12 people.
Police arrested the suspect, Nomura Shiraishi, who was driving the trailer, on the morning of 12th, on suspicion of causing injury to a 71-year-old man in the first chase accident.
The trailer of the suspected gunman continued to go forward without stepping on the brakes after the accident, and the fire department also confirmed that the suspect had temporarily lost consciousness immediately after the accident.
However, according to investigators, the suspect was not ill and some negligence was believed to be the cause.
Police are searching the house and house of the deceased and are investigating the circumstances.

The fourth issue of the comic book series, The Kin-Mean Man Review.
The 20th Superhuman Olympics started with three volumes and ended with four volumes!
The new game is full of new tricks, as opposed to the previous book, which focused on one game from the opening to the semi-final!
● The Superhuman Prole has already started before the game!
The four volumes are not, so to speak, a very neat depiction of the final match between Kin-Shamman and Robin Mask, but I want to emphasize first that this is not a book that is just about the ring.
We're not going to be able to play the game, but it's never boring.
The feeling of the increasing tension that the war of the century is about to begin is certainly linked to the rise of the tension among readers, and it is impressive that even this period is a calculated performance.
And one more hill to be missed before the big final is Terriman vs. Ramenman's third final.
And while I'm wearing the luxury of a fighting card, what I love is when Rahman is backstage before the game, looking at the Kin-Man poster, and he says, "It's my turn to fight!"
And try to knock the chop.
But the teleman who happened to pass by, took the knife and stopped, and looked at it in silence, and the scene was just going to end there.
What's amazing is that both of them have already been eliminated, and there's no chance of fighting the meat man in this tournament.
But there's a little bit of a twist about the meat man.
And when you see this, you can't help but think about what you're going to do in the future!
And that's what it's like to stand up, and that's what I'm still feeling as a cartoonist.
The two fights end in a very small way, but the famous scene is the cry of Rahman after the match.
"Don't rely on the strength of God's luck!"
It's a phrase that says,
I think this is a great meta-statement on the work itself, and I think that the readers and the Kin-Kakman have already felt that, in the end, the protagonist is not defeated and somehow is winning in a place that is not competent.
But by making Rahman say this, Mr. Yuyu has stabbed himself in the back, because he can't use his hands.
And in this sentence, the reader says, "Well, then, is the King of Meat really going to take Robin by force?
How did you do that?"
And you can imagine the unseen, and from another writer's point of view, this is the same line that the master of the art of making a work of art has imposed on himself.
This is a great thing.
I think that's one of the big points of this book.

Winter Illumination Weekend is held in the city of Akita, Fukui Prefecture (FBC Fukui Broadcasting) - Yahoo! news
The first winter illumination begins in the Achuha-san herbal village in Nakasaki, Kagahama, and the garden is surrounded by gentle light.
The winter illumination, which began on November 26, has been spread out over 20,000 LED lights, including a 20-meter-high spire, a promenade, and a lawn.
"I was surprised to find this place in Fukui after coming here for a long time", said the arrivals from Shiga Prefecture.
"It was so beautiful, and I was so relaxed".
The illumination is planned for the first time, to help you feel healthier while avoiding crowds, and will be lit from 5pm to 8.30pm on Friday, Saturday and Sunday until 25 December.

I think there are only a few people who can read the document in turn.
I asked if he had a friend who could read a lot of things, and he could, but he was stuck with the basics of Linux and stuff, and he read it in a reference book rather than a document.

I'm going to do a little bit of lab work.
I'm sorry to hear about this morning.
I'm not getting any power to my NAS PC.
- What happened?
1. Open the window in the morning to get air.
I'm on my computer.
2.) After a while, when I get back to the room, I notice that the computer is sounding like a pink rotor.
At this point, I thought that the fan's movement was only worsening due to the lower room temperature (6°C).
So I decided to try again after I had warmed up the room.
3. not activated.
When you press the power button, the light bulb will stop and the fan will start to move.
I'll never say it again.
I'll try again, but it'll only take a second.
4.) Connect the motherboard to the ATX 20 pin or 4 pin only, remove the other parts and try without starting.
5.) I suspect that the PSU is the cause of the noise that PSU fans have made in the past, as if they were hitting something.
I'll find the ATX power supply and try it out.
I guess.
If not, what do I do?
I'm gonna change the case and the mother together.

The most commonly used characters in 2021
My number one favorite is the crying typeface.
I think that the visual arts are an indispensable communication tool for modern people.
Recently, many messaging apps and chat tools have made it possible to react with pictures instead of stamps.
Quick, easy, no reply, no messing around.
The soft atmosphere that is so important in modern communication is the art of writing!
I'm not sure what kind of writing you're using.
See all images. The most used typefaces in the world in 2021: Top 10 most used typefaces in the world in 2021!
The overall picture is positive and bright.
According to the original Unicode, 92% of the world's Internet population uses pictorial writing.
The first is that it accounts for 5% of all the use of pictorial writing.
And the first, third, and fifth, the weeping characters, they're very easy to use.
When it's fun, when it's happy, of course, it's done!
I'm sure there are many people who use it in a self-destructive way even when they feel like they're not doing anything.
And the person who says he's never used the top 10 characters is the one in the row.
I want you to stick to that style.
