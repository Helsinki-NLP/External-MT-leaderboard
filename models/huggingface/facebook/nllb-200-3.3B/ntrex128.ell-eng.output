Welsh MPs are worried they'll be confused with the "Muppets"
Some MEPs expressed concern at the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This concern arose in connection with plans to change the name of the Welsh Assembly.
Members across the political spectrum are concerned that this will sound ridiculous.
A Labour MP said his party was concerned that it would "be synonymous with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, the word "twp" means "dull" and the word "pwp" means "peritriots".
A Plaid MP said the whole side was "not satisfied" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his own party was "open-minded" about the name change, but noted that the word MWP is not far from the word "moppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the English Yorkshire pronunciation of the letter u.
The parliamentary committee, which is currently drafting the bill to enact the name change, said: "The final decision on whatever name the MPs will be called will of course be a matter for the MPs themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Parliament the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which were widely accepted for the name of the house as the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the title of Members, the Commission favoured the title 'Member of the Welsh Parliament' or WMP, but the choice of MWP was the one which received the most support in the public consultation.
MEPs are obviously suggesting alternatives, but trying to reach consensus could prove difficult for the Speaker of Parliament, Elin Jones, who is expected to table the name change bill in the coming weeks.
The reform law will also include other changes to the way the parliament operates, including rules on the deprivation of office of an MP and the design of the committee system.
MEPs will decide in the final vote on the issue of their name when debating legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls for a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on changing the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The people's vote was sought in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens claims that the name of its northern neighbor conceals territorial overtones and has repeatedly opposed its claims to EU and NATO membership.
Georgi Ivanov, the president of FYROM, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change is simply the price they must pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells have fallen silent as the churches in Harlem disappear
"The older people I spoke to say that there used to be a bar and a church on every corner", said Mr. Adams.
Today, there is neither".
He said he understood why the bars were gone.
"People socialize differently today", he said.
"The bar is no longer the 'lounge' of the neighborhood where people frequent".
As for the churches, he worries that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as officials hope "and sooner or later will return to the point from which they started".
Churches, he added, may be replaced by apartment blocks filled with people unwilling to help the places of worship that remain in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who will buy apartments in these buildings will be white", he said, "and therefore will hasten the day when all these churches will close completely, because it is unlikely that all these people who will move into these apartments will become members of the churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan Community was built in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original Methodist congregation left in the 1930's.
A black congregation nearby took over the building.
The St. Martin's building was taken over by a black congregation under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who boycotted the shops on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, which refused to hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 caused serious damage to the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners undertook the reconstruction and commissioned the carillon.
The Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable instrument of historical significance".
The expert, Tiffany Ehn of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who had been transferred to a larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years earlier.
Mr. Meriwether said that St. Martin's Church didn't replace him.
What has been happening in recent months in St. Martin is a complicated story between architects and contractors, some of whom were hired by the lay leaders of the church, while others were hired by the diocese.
The commissioners - the governing body of the parish, made up of lay leaders - sent the diocese a letter in July concerning their concerns that the diocese "would seek to shift the cost" to the commissioners' board, despite the fact that it had no involvement in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the church.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark attack on 13-year-old diving for lobsters in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday while diving for California lobster, the first day of lobster season, according to authorities.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in the city of Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was scuba diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the child's cries for help and approached paddling with a team to get him out of the water.
Hamel said that at first he thought they were just shouts of excitement because he had caught a lobster, but then he realized he was shouting "Something bit me!
Something bit me!
His entire collar was open", Hamel observed when he reached the boy's location.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the sea!'" added Hamel.
The boy was airlifted to the Randy Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is critical.
The species of shark responsible for the attack remains unknown.
Rescuer Larry Giles told the press that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but was not considered to be an endangered species.
Giles added that the victim has severe injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities have blocked access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to the Swamis in Encinitas for 48 hours for research and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans are putting pressure on the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by putting cosmetic shelves in the same way as department stores, staffed by specialist employees.
As part of the substantial rise in the UK cosmetics market of £2.8 billion, which is still growing while sales of clothing and household goods are falling, larger cosmetics shelves will be piloted in 11 shops across the country and will be rolled out to more shops if the venture is successful.
Investment in cosmetics comes as supermarkets look for ways to replace the shelf space once occupied by televisions, microwaves, and household items.
Sainsbury's said it would double the size of its cosmetics offering to 3,000 products, including companies like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing lines of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space with company-branded shelves, similar to those of stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is re-launching its own make-up line Boutique so that most products are vegan - something that younger consumers are increasingly asking for.
In addition, fragrance company The Fragrance Shop will test its products in two Sainsbury's stores, one opened in Croydon, South London, last week and the other in Shelley Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the trend to buy small amounts of food every day in local mini-markets means that supermarkets will have to make greater efforts to get people to visit them.
Mike Koop, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said outlets will increasingly resemble department stores as supermarket chains try to compete with discount stores Aldi and Lidl with more services outside of food.
Sainsbury's put Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, and also introduced some Habitat as they bought both chains two years ago, which supported grocery sales and made more profitable acquisitions.
The supermarket's previous attempt to renovate the cosmetics and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended after a dispute over how profits from the chain's pharmacy stores were distributed to the chain's supermarkets.
The new strategy was designed after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
He said Lloyds would play its own role in the scheme, adding an expanded range of luxury grooming companies, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's' commercial director, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our shelves in order to improve the environment for our consumers.
We also invested in specially trained staff who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of companies is designed to meet every need, and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a strong destination for cosmetics that challenges the traditional way of shopping".
Peter Jones: furious after Holly Willoughby's departure from the £11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of her £11m lifestyle business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for the clothing and accessories company Truly.
Their business was likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop.
The 37-year-old former This Morning host announced her decision to leave on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has infuriated Dragons Den star Peter Jones by quitting her lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her new huge contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was furious when the golden girl of television admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at his empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that due to her new contracts - worth £1.5 million - she would no longer have enough time to spend on the clothing and accessories company Truly.
The company has been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop and appears to have doubled Willoughby's fortune estimated to be £11 million.
After 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of the UK to one of his country homes.
According to one source: "Truly was far from Holly Willoughby's top priorities.
It was about her long-term future, her source of income for decades to come.
Her decision to leave came as a surprise to everyone involved in the operation.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the presentation.
There is a warehouse full of products at the headquarters in Marlow ready to be sold".
Experts estimate that the departure of the "This Morning" host, who is among Britain's most commercial celebrities, could cost the company millions due to the huge investment in products from pillows and wax to clothing and homeware, as well as further delaying her appearance.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Holly Wiloby, mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have maintained a close friendship with Jones and his wife Tara Kapp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Kapp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couples spend their vacations together and Jones retains a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is set to become the face of M&S campaigns and replace Adam McPartlin as host of "I'm A Celebrity" on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We would not like to comment on his business dealings".
We were tough and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he received from the media for a comment that some would consider inappropriate for a president, as well as his very positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump make so many concessions?
Trump said in a TV-presenter look.
"I have not given up anything".
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a big step towards denuclearising North Korea.
However, negotiations on denuclearization have been delayed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Rai Yong-ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea sees no "comparable response" from the US after North Korea's premature disarmament.
The EU has also been active in the fight against terrorism, and has been active in the fight against terrorism in the region since the beginning of the year.
Trump maintained a much more optimistic attitude in his speech.
"We're doing very well with North Korea", he said.
"We almost went to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
Now we have built this extraordinary relationship".
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results - an end to missile tests, the release of hostages, and the return of the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
While he backed his unusual stance in statements about his relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to have a 'presidential' attitude, but instead of having 10,000 people sitting outside the room because they couldn't get in, we would have had only 200 people here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia sweep across an entire island, leaving thousands dead in their wake
In the aftermath of the earthquake in Lubok, for example, it was announced that the assistance of foreign NGOs would not be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lobok was displaced, it was not declared a national disaster, a prerequisite for the availability of international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not seeking international help, so it is quite difficult", Ms. Shubung said.
While Save the Children is preparing a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether the foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute aid.
Given the earthquakes that often strike Indonesia, the country remains woefully unprepared for nature's wrath.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, the same is not true of other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami alarm siren in Palu, even after a warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of so many lives.
At best, traveling between Indonesia's many islands is difficult.
The Commission has already taken a number of measures to improve the quality of the information available to the public.
A floating hospital that had been stationed in Lobok to care for earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made improving Indonesia's dilapidated infrastructure the focus of his election campaign, and he gave generously to building roads and railways.
However, a lack of funding is plaguing Mr Joko's administration ahead of re-election next year.
Mr Joko is also under pressure from lingering fanatical trends in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of belief.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced as Christian and Muslim groups battle in the streets, using knives, bows and arrows, and other improvised weapons.
Watch as Liverpool 's Daniel Sturridge draws against Chelsea and the club 's goalkeeper ,
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea with an 89th-minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Steritz received a pass from Serdhan Sakiri about 27 yards from Chelsea's goal with his team losing 1-0.
He hit the ball to his left and shot it into the back yard.
His effort was driven very high off the big area and ended up right in the nets.
The ball finally landed on Kepa Arizabalaga who jumped to repel it and went into the net.
"I was trying to get that position, to get to the ball and players like Shakiri always play as much forward as possible, so I tried to gain as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Cante coming, I made a direct switch, I didn't think much about it, and I made the shot".
Chelsea had a 1-0 lead at halftime after a goal in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue forward gave a high heel pass to Mateo Kovacic in this game, before throwing a foul shot near the center of the court and running to the Liverpool side.
Kovacic made a one-two at center field.
Then he gave a deep shot, leading Azar into wide area.
Azhar ran ahead of the defender and finished off the ball sending the ball to the nets on the back post with a left-hand shot ahead of Liverpool's Alison Baker.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against Wighton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
The tragic death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia stands at 832, according to statements from the country's natural disaster service early on Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed after the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that hit the area on Friday and created waves of 6 meters, agency spokesman Sutopo Puruo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The city of Palo, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by the debris of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old suspect after he stabbed a woman to death.
A murder investigation has been launched following the discovery of the body of a woman in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55am with multiple stab wounds in Grayson Moose on John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested as a suspect in the murder.
The police have asked the locals who saw or heard something to report it to the police .
Police Officer Brian O'Higgig said: "The investigation is in its early stages but I would like to appeal to anyone who has been in the vicinity of John Street and has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have picked up something on the dashcam footage to contact us as they may be in possession of information that is vital to our investigation".
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside a building.
This afternoon friends who believe they may know the woman arrived at the crime scene to ask questions about the location where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing as police said they are in the process of informing the next of kin.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Moose, in his attempt to return to his apartment was informed by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was stunned when he found out what had happened.
Residents were told that it may be hours before they are allowed to return to their homes.
A police officer is reported to have told a man that the entire area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared on stage in tears.
He kept saying, "That's awful".
At 2 p.m., two police vans were inside the police line and one was outside.
Police officers were standing outside the curb and watching the apartment complex.
Anyone with any information is asked to text @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Crimestoppers line anonymously on 0800 555 111 for the 247 of September 30th case.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament becomes the latest monument to be hit by the quarrel over "rewriting history"
His ouster would be poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of England's numerous cultural and religious works by his fanatical Puritan supporters.
However, the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal "foolish" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the present discussion of the removal of the statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Halls would not be targeted.
The iconoclasm of England's civil wars was not dictated or executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong member of the Cromwell family was sacrificed for the actions of Thomas's ancestor in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thornycroft's brilliant portrayal of Cromwell is a hallmark of his 19th-century image and part of the biography of a personality many believe to be worthy of tribute.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is still seen by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressures, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate assumption is the subject of open historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflicts of the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing one side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also commendable and memorable".
Pig-murderer fatally wounds Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local news outlets.
The man, whose surname was only given as "Wuan", was found with a severed artery in a pool of blood near a pig farm in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, South China, the Morning Post reported Sunday.
An employee at a pig farm prepares to give pigs vaccines on May 30, 2005 in Jining in Qinghai Province, China.
He allegedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered the door to a neighboring pigsty open.
He said that in the pigsty there was a large male pig with blood in its mouth.
The coroner's examination confirmed that the 500-pound pig had fatally injured the farmer, according to his report.
"My cousin's legs were bloodied and bruised", said the cousin, known by the surname "Wu", according to the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Wan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man doesn't belong to Wang or his cousin.
A market official told the evening news that the pig has been caged to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police gathered evidence at the scene of the attack.
Wang's family and the market authorities are reportedly negotiating some compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have been recorded in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years ago, a 295-kilogram pig threw a Welsh farmer onto his tractor until the farmer's wife scared the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "sentiment".
"They're just in a playful mood.
They're small, very strange creatures. They don't want to hurt.
We just have to show them the proper respect", he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are set to bring extensive rainfall to the Southwestern United States .
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rains to northern Mexico and the Southwestern United States in the coming days.
Hurricane Rosa's winds reached 85 mph, making it a Category 1 hurricane at 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, an area of low pressure winds has begun to form over the Pacific Ocean and is moving east toward the West Coast of the U.S. As Hurricane Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will bring tropical moisture northward to the Southwestern U.S.
Hurricane Rosa will bring 25 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Subsequently, tropical moisture combined with the approaching low-pressure winds will create extensive heavy rainfall in the Southwest over the next few days.
Locally, rainfall of between two and three inches will cause dangerous flooding, debris flows and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will lead to precipitation rates approaching 5 to 7.5 inches per hour in places, especially in parts of Southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of 5 to 10 centimeters is expected in places in the Southwest, especially in large parts of Arizona.
Floods are possible with rapidly worsening phenomena due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
It is recommended that you avoid any travel on foot in the desert in view of the threat of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rains can turn gorges into rapids, and storms will cause local high winds and sandstorms.
The area of low pressure winds will create some locally heavy rainfall in places along the Southern California coastline.
Overall rainfall of more than 1 centimeter is possible, which can cause small debris flows and slippery roads.
This will be the first rain of the wet season in the region.
Some scattered tropical storms will begin approaching Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday, before the phenomena expand late on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread across the Four Corners area on Tuesday and continue through Wednesday.
October will see some sharp temperature changes across the U.S. as temperatures in the Arctic drop, but in the tropics remain quite high.
Sometimes this leads to very sharp temperature changes at close range.
A typical example of the stark temperature differences between the central U.S. was seen on Sunday.
There was a nearly 10-point difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, persistent high summer temperatures will be observed and spread again.
In much of the Central and Eastern United States, October is expected to begin with high temperatures of 27 °C from the Eastern Plains to portions of the Southeast.
The temperature in New York City can reach 90 degrees on Tuesday, about five degrees above average.
According to our long-term weather forecast, there is a good chance of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States through the first half of October.
Over 20 million viewers tuned in to the Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million viewers watched the deposition of U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on Thursday and the woman who accused him of sexual assault, alleged to have occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blaze Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, with television networks interrupting the regular programming flow for the last-minute overturn on Friday: the agreement by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to conduct a week-long investigation by the FBI in connection with the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she's 100 percent certain that at a party when they were high school students Kavanaugh attacked her while drunk and tried to take her clothes off.
Kavanaugh, in a loaded statement, said he was 100 percent certain that nothing like that had happened.
According to Nielsen's measurements, more than 20.4 million viewers likely watched the hearing on Friday.
The company calculated the average viewership on the networks CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately made available to other networks that aired the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
While also, Nielsen usually has difficulty in calculating the number of viewers watching a broadcast from office spaces.
To put this audience in perspective, it's an audience the size of a football playoff game or an Academy Awards ceremony.
Fox News, whose journalists strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led the way with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the all-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
In second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
They were followed by CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake has been cast as the lead in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican declared that he would vote for Kavanaugh, cameras on CNN and CBS recorded Friday morning protesters cheering him as he tried to get into the elevator for the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood looking down for several minutes as he was being evaluated live on CNN.
"I stand here before you", said one woman.
"Do you believe he's telling the truth in this country?
He said, "You have power when so many women are powerless".
Flake stated that his office had made statements and, before the elevator doors closed, that he would have more to say at the Commission's hearing.
All cable and broadcast networks were live a few hours later, the Senate Judiciary Committee vote on the promotion of Kavanaugh's candidacy to the full Senate floor for a vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the nominee next week, something that was requested by the Democratic minority.
Flake was persuaded in part by discussions with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Koons.
After discussions with Koons and some other senators thereafter, Flake ruled.
Flake's choice had a force, because it was obvious that the Republicans would not muster the votes for Kavanaugh's approval without conducting an investigation.
President Trump has asked for an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses her critics of playing games with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of Brexit plans of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview along with its own front page, former foreign secretary Boris Johnson rails harshly at Chequers' Brexit plan, saying the proposal to collect tariffs between Britain and the EU was "utterly absurd".
Police have arrested suspect Dayton Simpson in the LSU player 's murder .
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Simms, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dayton Simpson, 20, was arrested and is being held in custody on a charge of second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities have obtained a video of Simms's altercation with Simpson and according to police Simms lost his glasses during the altercation.
The officers located the glasses at the crime scene and said they found traces of Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, which is working with CBS.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to fatally wounding Wade.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to his lawyer.
According to the preliminary report of the East Baton Rouge Coroner released Friday, cause of death is gunshot wounds to the head and neck.
The Department has put a task force of Louisiana State Police, the police crime lab, Southern University police forces and local citizens at the disposal of the department to assist in the arrest investigation.
LSU athletic director Joey Aleeva thanked local law enforcement for the "comprehensive investigation and pursuit of justice".
Simms was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "devastated" and "in a state of shock" over Wade's death.
"We're always worried about incidents like this", Wade said.
Emissions from volcanic ash in Mexico City
Emissions of volcanic ash from the Popocatépetl volcano have reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned residents of Mexico on Sunday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater reached its peak, with 183 emissions of gases and ash recorded over a 24-hour period.
The Centre was monitoring various signs and small earthquakes.
Images on social media show windshields covered in thin layers of ash in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Sochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity at the volcano, located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police forces clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with law enforcement units as thousands took part in demonstrations marking the first anniversary of the polarizing vote for Catalonia's secession.
A group of masked pro-independence protesters, held down by the order restoration units, threw eggs and paint in the dust, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that are usually flooded with tourists.
Clashes also occurred later in the day with police using batons to quell the clashes.
For hours, pro-independence groups in Catalonia chanted "We do not forgive, we do not forget" against pro-unity groups chanting "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were hospitalized with minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in the pro-independence region a year after the October 1 referendum was declared illegal by Madrid, but is celebrated by separatists in Catalonia.
The overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, although turnout was low with those opposed to independence boycotting the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, about 1000 people were injured last year after police attempted to disrupt voting at polling stations in the region where violent clashes took place.
Pro-independence groups camped out late Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place but was forced to take a different turn.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the pro-independence demonstrations with his wife, said he no longer held out hope for Catalonia's prospects of winning its independence.
"Last year was one of our brightest moments.
I saw my parents with tears of joy that they managed to vote, but now the situation is stagnant", he said.
Despite scoring a crucial, if limited, victory in regional elections last December, the Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many of their best-known leaders having been self-exiled or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joann Putsch, a 42-year-old engineer who filmed the pro-police protests on his cell phone, said the clashes were fueled by politicians from both camps.
"The tension is escalating more and more", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders detained last year, announced his candidacy in next year's European elections.
"My candidacy in the European elections is the best way to denounce the repression of democratic values and the oppression that we have received from the Spanish government", he said.
London: Man arrested after car crashes into home
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a repeated car crash at a residence in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Bolingard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Flemings said there was damage to the gates and the building itself.
There may have been a shooting in the car at some point.
Menga's shot gave Livingston a 1-0 win against the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win
The up-and-coming Livingston surprised the Rangers by handing Steven Gerrard just his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Iberobokers.
Dolly Menga's shot made the difference as Gary Holt's side changed level with Hibernian in second.
Gerrard's team remains undefeated in the league this season and will face the Hearts, who are eight points ahead, next Sunday.
Before this game, Rangers host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, continues its undefeated run of six games in their division, with head coach Holt still undefeated since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone is losing ground to the visitors.
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before he scored, with his immediacy putting the Rangers in a difficult position.
Scott Robinson took the lead and came within a whisker of the goal, but Alan Lithgow blocked his attempt by slipping Craig Halkett's head off the line.
The homeowners willingly let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could outplay the visitors on free kicks and corner kicks.
And that's how the big goal came.
The Rangers were unable to block a free kick and Livingston opened the scoring, Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to send the ball to Menga, who took the pass and scored from the center of the area.
Up to that point, the Rangers had dominated possession but found the home defense impenetrable and goalie Liam Kelly was not facing difficult situations.
This pattern continued into the second half, though Alfredo Morelos deflected the ball from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's ball was fouled by the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor and Lithgow's pass was out on another free-kick by Livingston.
A number of vertical passes were made in the Livingston area and were repeatedly fouled, while two penalties - after a claim by Halkett against substitute player Glen Middleton and one for a hand - were called, which were dismissed.
"Excellent Game" by Livingstone - analyzed
This is the BBC Scotland, Alexander Lamond, at the Tony MacCaroni Arena.
Spectacular performances and results for Livingston.
All of them, without exception, have been outstanding, exceeding expectations in their upward march.
Their playing style and personality changed little after their return to top form, but credit should be given to Holt for the boost he gave the team with his arrival.
His team had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding, putting together a superbly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joey Worrell on their toes throughout the game.
The Rangers, on the other hand, were uninspired.
As good as they were in the past under Gerard's guidance, they didn't meet those standards.
Their last game was a shaky one - only once did they manage to get past the home-court defence and that's a warning bell for Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Mixed feelings at Erdogan's reception in Cologne
The climate was good on Saturday (September 29) at the breakfast meeting of the Turkish and German heads of state in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at restoring relations with NATO allies.
They were divided on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdoğan then headed to Cologne to inaugurate a new huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey.
Police had blocked the 25,000-strong crowd from gathering in front of the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters managed to get close enough to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them of Kurdish origin - also showed up, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The division of the protesters reflects the controversial nature of a visitor who is treated by some Turkish Germans as a hero and by others as a dictator.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist killed after collision with car
A cyclist has died after being hit by a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy thoroughfare in Dettford, in the south-east of the city, at approximately 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance rescuers tried to help, but the man died at the scene.
The collision came a few months after a similar incident in which a driver hit and left a cyclist dead on the Childers Street road, about a mile from Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said that authorities were making efforts to identify the man and to inform their next of kin.
Roads have been closed and bus routes diverted, while drivers have been instructed to avoid the area.
Long Lardins Prison: Six police officers were injured in clashes
Six police officers were injured in riots that broke out in high-security men's prisons, according to statements from the prison administration.
Riots broke out at His Majesty's Long Lardine Prison in Worcestershire at about 09:30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Special police forces "Tornado" have been mobilized to deal with the riots, involving eight detainees, which took place in one wing.
The officers were hospitalized with minor facial injuries during the clashes.
A prison spokesman said: "Specially trained personnel have taken over the incident at Her Majesty's Long Larding Prison.
Six members of the staff were hospitalized with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we make clear that those responsible will be referred to the police authorities and may serve longer sentences".
His Majesty's Long Lardine Prison houses over 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June the warden was hospitalized after being attacked by an inmate.
In October last year, the prison's law enforcement units were called in to quell a serious disturbance that erupted, during which staff members were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with flash floods (drought-hit areas may benefit)
It's rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early next week as the remnants of Hurricane Rosa cross the southwestern portions of the desert, bringing flooding in their wake.
The National Weather Service has already issued emergency flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to pass right over Phoenix on Tuesday, where it will arrive late on Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that only "ten tropical cyclones have remained in tropical storm or low barometric state within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border".
The latest models from the US National Hurricane Center predict rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with isolated rainfall volumes up to 6 inches in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive rainfall of 1 to 2 inches, with the possibility of individual totals of up to 4 inches.
For areas not at risk of flooding, the rain that Rosa brings can be a blessing, as the area is hit by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious issue, some of this rainfall is expected to be beneficial, as the Southwestern States are currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Drought Observatory, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category of drought", weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa will make landfall on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Maintaining the intensity of the hurricane, by Sunday morning Rosa will be 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will meet cooler waters in the Pacific and therefore weaken.
As a result, it is expected to make landfall in Mexico with tropical storm intensity by this afternoon or Monday night.
Heavy rainfall is likely in parts of Mexico, which will cause significant flooding risk.
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of rainfall is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, possibly as much as 10 inches", according to weather.com.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm now and will reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona to reach southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The primary hazard expected from Hurricane Rosa or its remnants is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the Southwestern states of the United States", the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause dangerously intense flooding and mudslides in the deserts and landslides in the mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at approximately 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital, where he remains in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Randstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Police are appealing to anyone who may have captured the video on their cell phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh "lived the evil and the anger" of the Democratic Party.
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of rejection of the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "lived the malice and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified to Congress on Thursday, vehemently and with apparent emotion denying Christine Blaze Ford's allegations that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified in court about her allegations.
The president said Saturday that the "American people saw the greatness, the quality and the courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh's nomination is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an outstanding record of public service", he told the crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president made a passing reference to the candidacy of Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I am not a candidate, but in fact it is as if I am", he said.
"That's why I travel all over the world supporting great candidates".
Trump said the Democrats are on a "resistance and obstruction" mission.
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior aide to the Republican leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of people were killed by an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia and the total death toll is expected to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many of them swept away by giant waves that swept ashore, when a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Sunday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves six meters high hit the shore at dusk, sweeping many to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was triggered by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn't run immediately, so they were hit by it", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB disaster management agency, in a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come by itself, it swept away cars, timber, houses, it hit everything on land", said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had traveled the ocean at speeds of 500 miles per hour before it hit the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were moved to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster management service show many damaged buildings and shops, crumbled and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Tremors continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The quakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Bureau of Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is located at the end of a narrow bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said that hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
He said that scores of victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage may be greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Dongola, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Communication systems "have completely failed and there is no information" from Dongola, he said.
"More than 300,000 people live there", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy and it can get worse", he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for failing to report that a tsunami had hit Palau, even though officials said the waves had arrived by the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man can be heard on the top floor of a building shouting in panic trying to warn people down the street of the coming tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the shore, sweeping away houses and cars.
Reuters was not able to immediately verify the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage, which also cut off communications in the wider area of Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending transport planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the displaced are still in desperate need of food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has reopened only to aid relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palo on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is over 800.
This is a very bad situation.
Although World Vision staff from Dongola managed to reach the city of Palu safely, where workers took shelter in tented shelters set up in the courtyard of their office, they passed scenes of disaster on their way, Mr. Dosemba said.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses", he said.
This is a very bad situation.
While some relief groups have taken on the daunting task of starting the process of relief, some complain that foreigners, especially experienced aid workers, have not been allowed to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, the flow of funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only start if the site of a disaster is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a provincial-level disaster", said Auliya Arrian, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says it's a national disaster, we can ask for international assistance, but there's no decision yet".
As the second day in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami passes, friends and family of those still missing are still hoping that their loved ones will be the miracle that makes the story of these natural disasters less bleak.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under debris for two days, next to her dead mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national skydiving team, had trained two of the missing skydivers for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other people trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandaji, were his students.
"As a veteran of the sport of skydiving, I have my own emotional baggage", he said.
Mr. Genton recounted how, when news of the Roa Roa hotel collapse circulated in the skydiving community, he began sending desperate WhatsApp messages to his opponents in Palu who were attending the beach festival.
However, the indication next to his messages was a grey "n" symbol instead of two blue ones.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered", he said.
Thieves made off with $26,750 when they restocked an ATM machine in Newport on the Levy.
On Friday morning, thieves withdrew $26,750 from a Brink employee who was doing an ATM machine refill in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM machine at the entertainment complex and was preparing to hand over more money, police officer Dennis McCarthy said in the release.
While he was busy, another man "came running after the Brink employee" and stole a bag of money that was meant for delivery.
Witnesses saw many suspects fleeing the scene, according to the statement, but police did not specify the number of those involved.
Anyone with information regarding their identity should contact the Newport Police Department, calling 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Yee
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Yee.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, "The being officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has long been a fan of the pet name Ye and used that nickname as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change was preceded by his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to debut his new album titled Yandhi.
She replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her appearance for "emotional reasons", as the show's creator reported.
In addition to being an abbreviation of the professional name he uses today, West has stated in the past that the word has religious significance to him.
"I believe the word 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, in a discussion of the album's title with radio producer Big Boy.
So I am you, we are we, we are we.
My name is changing from Kanye, meaning "the one", to Yee, which is just a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused self, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are".
He's one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Cobbs is known by various names, including Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Didi, but announced this year that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
A former associate of West, ZE-ZI, is also satisfied with the use of his name with or without the hyphenation and capitalisation.
The President-elect of Mexico swears he will not use the military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody student crackdown.
Lopez Obrador vowed Saturday in the plaza of Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, troops opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the plaza, killing 300 people, at a time when leftist student movements were taking root across Latin America.
López Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly stipends to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He stated that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are pushing young people towards criminal gangs.
The US should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on AI research, says AI investor and professional Cai-Fu Li, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This comment comes in addition to statements by various parts of the US government on artificial intelligence, as the US does not have a formal strategy on artificial intelligence as a whole.
Meanwhile, China last year unveiled its plan to become the world's leading country in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the US and we are looking to make the next major breakthrough in AI", said Lee.
Doubling the budget could double the chances of the next big breakthrough in artificial intelligence happening in the US, Lee said in an interview on CNBC this week.
Li, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was released this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's leading AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an artificial intelligence system that beat the top American player, Othello, and later was an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China division.
Lee recognized the importance of previous US government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Robotics Challenge, and wondered when the next one would be held, so that the next visionaries could be identified.
Researchers in the US often have to work hard to receive government grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that's taking the best of academia, it's companies", he said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired academics from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee argued that changes in immigration policy could also help the US support its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that holders of a PhD in artificial intelligence should be automatically offered a green card", he said.
The State Council of China issued a Next-Generation AI Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in academic institutions as the National Science Foundation and other government agencies respectively distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is inferior, Li said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which will be joined by partners from the business and academic world, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The National Science Foundation in the United States is now investing more than $100 million a year in research in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, no progress has been made in months on U.S. legislation to create a National Security Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonian citizens hold referendum to decide whether to change the country's name
The people of FYROM participated in a referendum on Sunday to decide whether the country should be renamed "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would trigger a decades-long disagreement with Greece that had blocked the country's candidacy for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, argues that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President George Ivanov has said he will not participate in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether turnout will reach the required 50 percent to make the referendum valid.
The question on the ballot was: 'Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU by accepting the agreement with Greece?'
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to pursue membership in organizations like the EU and NATO for FYROM, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, so that the youth of FYROM can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because then all our lives will be safer", said Oliviera Georgievskaya, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, several members of parliament have said they will abide by the result of the vote to make it final.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is required to change the name.
The State Election Commission said there were no reports of irregularities as of 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters turned out.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said Joze Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
The Prime Minister of FYROM, Zoraf Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko voted in the referendum on changing the country's name that would pave the way for the country's accession to NATO and the European Union in the town of Strumica, FYROM on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small tent and sets up chairs in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads held high, not as second-class partners", said Kavardarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian Union".
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I believe the overwhelming majority will be in favour, as over 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", Zaev said after voting.
He said that a positive outcome would be "the confirmation of our future".
According to a poll published last Monday by the Institute of Political Research of the FYROM, the turnout in the referendum would be between 30 and 43 percent of voters, which is below the required turnout.
According to another poll conducted by the Macedonian TV station Telma TV, 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote in favor.
For the referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it came to power last May.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero goes through the whole of Brighton's defence to score.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling completed Brighton's defence in a 2-0 win for Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero scored with ease in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward was passed in the middle of the field at the start of the phase.
He got through three Brighton defenders before he spilled out in the open.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green players.
He threw a pass to one defender, then evaded several others on the edge of Brighton's big area.
Then he passed to his left, finding Sterling.
The English forward made his first move into the area returning the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan, scoring from the right side of the net.
"Aguero is experiencing some problems with his legs", City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We said he'd play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at that moment".
However, it was Stirling who gave the Blues the initial edge in the battle for the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero took the ball deep into Brighton's territory in that phase.
He threw a beautiful ball along the left side to Leroy Sané.
Sané kept possession and guided Sterling to the back of the net.
The blue forward kicked the ball into the net just before he went out.
City take on Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar Arena in Sinheim, Germany.
Sarge wants to beat the Rockies .
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there was no point in him trying to make another start.
But the ever-competitive Sargeant is hoping to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still implications for the Rockies in the playoffs, as they are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West.
The Rockies have made it to the playoffs with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still want to lock in first place in their division.
"Even though we have nothing to win, at least we can play knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the fans and the other team will make for a game probably the highest level I'll face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to fight in such a fight?"
The Nationals have yet to announce their starting pitcher for Sunday, but it's rumored they're leaning towards letting Sarge throw the ball.
Serger, who will be making his 34th start, made practice shots on Thursday and will play on Sunday, which is normally a rest day for him.
The right-hander from Washington is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump giving a speech in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his chosen Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in his speech on the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is a very important moment. I'm not a candidate, but in fact it's like I am, and that's why I travel all over to support great candidates", he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see this lousy, lousy radical group of Democrats, you see what's happening right now.
And they're determined to take back power by any means necessary.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to exterminate to get power and control, because what they want is power and control and we're not going to give it to them".
The Democrats, he said, have taken on a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"And you've seen it for the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry and evil, miserable and liars".
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee by name, referring to Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, a reference that was met with strong public condemnation.
"Remember her answer?
You declassified the document?
Oh, oh, what?
No, oh no, I'm waiting for an answer. That was a really bad use of body language, the worst use of body language I've ever seen".
The Labour Party is no longer a broad party.
He has no tolerance for those who express their opinions.
I was not at all surprised that Momentum activists in my local group voted to impeach me.
I am the last of a long line of Labour MPs who have been told that they are not welcome, precisely because we are speaking our minds.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was similarly treated, because she stood firmly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure was criticized because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of a responsible economic policy, of national security, of Europe, ironically, on issues similar to those on which Jeremy had disagreed with previous leaders.
The invitation to the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that "we want our meetings to be productive with participation by all".
For most of the eight years that I have been a local Labour MP, the General Committee meetings on Friday night have been just like this.
Unfortunately, today, this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more compassionate, more compassionate" policy has long been forgotten, if it ever really began to materialize.
It is increasingly apparent that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, as colleagues with whom I had previously thought we shared similar political views began to expect me to do a U-turn and adopt views I would never agree with, whether they were about national security or the EU's single market.
Every time I spoke publicly, no matter what I actually said, I would hear a chant on social media, where people would call for my dismissal, denounce the center's policy and tell me that I shouldn't be a member of the Labor Party.
And this didn't just happen to me.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than other colleagues, as the comments made to me were usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist abuse every day, but never back down.
One of the most frustrating aspects of this era in politics is how insults are now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn argued last week that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a broad party and that with every impeachment motion or change in the voting rules, the party's boundaries are narrowing.
I've been told a lot of times over the last two years not to stand up, not to talk too much, and that "everything will be all right".
But I didn't get into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, as a schoolboy, because of the neglect of the Thatcher government which led literally to the failure of my whole class, my purpose has been to secure better public services for those who need them most, whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I've never hidden my politics and I did the same in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused about my political views and my points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who put forward the motion of censure on Friday, all I have to say is that, as the country faces a Brexit that will hit our households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on whether I am loyal to the leader of the Labour Party.
But really, my only message is not to the members of Momentum in Nottingham, but to my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of rejection or political expediency will prevent me from acting as I believe is in the best interests of all of you.

Air - Melrose: 38 - 17: The undefeated Air climbs to the top
Two late goals may have skewed the final score somewhat, but there's no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this extremely entertaining match for the championship of the Tenet.
They're now at the top of the rankings, the only undefeated team in the Big Ten.
In the end, it was her superior defense, as well as her better use of opportunities, that tipped the scales in the home team's favor, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be pleased.
"We have been tested in our games so far and we are still unbeaten, so I must be happy", he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: "Congratulations to Ayr, they took advantage of the opportunities better than we did".
A 14th-minute goal by Grant Anderson, converted by Fraser Climot, brought Ayr to the front, but a yellow card to Scot Rory Hughes, who was released for the game by the Warriors, allowed the Melrose to exploit the numerical advantage and Jason Bagot scored a goal without conversion.
Climie increased the lead of the Air with a penalty, before scoring, right at halftime, a conversion goal, leading the Air to the relegation zone with a score of 17-5.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's goal, with Bagot's conversion, reduced the lead to five points.
There was a long wait due to a serious injury to Ruarind Not, who was carried off on a stretcher, and, after the restart, Ayr increased the gap further with a goal from Stafford McDowall, with a conversion from Climes.
The substitute captain Blair McPherson then received a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of the numerical advantage with a goal of Bruce Colvin without conversion, after a period of intense pressure.
The home side came back, however, and, when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for tackling Climes without the ball, from the penalty line, McPherson scored in the back of the attack launched by Ayr.
Klima made a conversion, as he's done since the reboot, after first Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's kick and sent Greg Henry's winger off for the fifth goal of the game.
The star of Still Game is starting a new career in catering.
Still Game star Ford Kiernan looks set to make a leap into the restaurant business after it was revealed he's been named the CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes and co-stars with longtime comedy partner Greg Hempfille.
The couple announced that the upcoming fifth cycle will also be the show's last, and it seems that Keernan is planning his life after Geigeland.
According to official records, he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the information, although a source for the Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wants to tackle the "growing restaurant industry" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Blockaded Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the road to the Pacific
Sailors are patrolling the fully equipped naval headquarters at La Paz.
Blue flags are waving at public buildings.
On the bases of the sailor from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon is written the motto: "The sea belongs to us by right.
It is our duty to take it back".
Across the landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the coastline Chile conquered after a bloody conflict over the exploitation of natural resources in the 19th century is still alive, as is the longing of its people to travel to the Pacific Ocean once again.
These hopes are now more alive than at any time in decades, as Bolivia awaits the International Court's decision on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and calm, and it is naturally looking forward to the outcome", said Roberto Calzantila, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will be watching the International Court of Justice ruling on big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim to force Chile, after decades of fragile negotiations, to negotiate for Bolivia's sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous Bolivian president, who is fighting a controversial re-election battle next year, has much to gain or lose from Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean", he promised in late August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in Bolivia's favor and that even if it did, it would not change much.
The UN body in the Netherlands has no authority to give Chilean territory and has made it clear that it will not determine the outcome of any possible discussions.
The fact that the International Court of Justice's decision is to be issued just six months after the presentation of the final arguments suggests that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of further Bolivia's goals, the past four years may have undermined them.
"The current government of Bolivia has usurped the issue of access to the sea", Zárate said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has exhausted any remaining goodwill in Chile, he argued.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to have discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veljerez, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the process of issuing the court's ruling was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to inaugurate a new era of relations with Chile" and the ability to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzantila also denied that Morales, who remains one of Latin America's most popular leaders, is using the issue of access to the sea as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean", he added.
The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to move beyond the past".
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament if it cannot trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his state will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke Saturday to the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made during a summit in Singapore by the leaders of the two countries.
Ri made these comments as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared ready to restart nuclear diplomacy that had reached a nadir, three months after meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Rhee says the notion that continued sanctions and the U.S. refusal to declare an end to the Korean War will eventually bring the North to its knees is a midnight dream.
Washington is reluctant to agree to issue a declaration unless Pyongyang makes significant disarmament moves first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is seriously considering renouncing an arsenal that the country sees as likely the only means of guaranteeing its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest trends in the oversized hats that will soon be available in a store near you
If you want to grow your collection of hats or avoid the sun altogether, then stop looking.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown have unveiled a series of bizarre oversized hats for their Spring/Summer 2019 collection that have stolen the show at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely awkward hats have been flooding Instagram this summer and their designers have sent their striking creations to the catwalk.
The piece that stood out from Valentino was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a wide feathered bow that completely covered the models' heads.
Among other oversized accessories were watermelons decorated with gems, a magician's hat, and even a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also unveiled a series of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and were more Hannibal Lecter-like than high-fashion.
One creation brought to mind full diving gear with breathing apparatus and goggles, while another looked like melted ice cream in a funnel.
And if you want to adopt this style of fashion with the huge accessories, you're in luck.
Stylists predict that these giant hats could reach main shopping streets near you.
Oversized hats were very quickly appearing after "La Bomba", the straw hat with the very wide brim that we've seen worn by so many, from Riana to Emily Ratajkowski.
The popular brand that created the extremely uncomfortable hat that has taken over social media has sent another great creation to the runway, a beach rug almost as big as the model carrying it in her swimsuit.
The dark orange shelf bag, decorated with shelf stools and a white leather handle, was the highlight of Jacquemus' 2019 La Rivière Spring-Summer collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and big beach bags in the malls next summer, as the designer has made such a big impression that it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools have a history of academic excellence, which continued in 2018, with yet another string of outstanding test results, which were only further enhanced by individual and collective successes in sports, the arts, music and other community endeavours.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible level of service to pupils and their parents.
The goal of independent schools is to prepare their students for the next and higher educational levels, the career they will choose, and their place as world citizens.
As an educational field that can design and implement a school curriculum to suit a particular need, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desired elective subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a person in a language that he understands, that goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart".
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year's exams, we find that languages are at the top of the performance charts, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68% of pupils who studied foreign languages achieved an A-level pass.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved an A grade in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those studying German, 69 percent of those studying French and 63 percent of those studying Spanish also had an A grade.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now considered as an elective subject as important as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
A UK Employment and Skills Commission survey in 2014 revealed that, as far as the reasons employers had difficulty filling vacancies, around 17 per cent were related to a lack of language skills.
The need to acquire language skills is therefore becoming increasingly urgent in order to prepare young people for their future professional careers.
As more future employment opportunities require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Whatever career one chooses, if one has learned a second language, one will have a real advantage in the future because of this skill that can be used throughout one's life.
If one is able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, then automatically this multilingual person will have an advantage over the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of respondents were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, while French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage of respondents (15 percent).
For this reason, investing in language teaching today is important for today's children.
Knowledge of several languages, especially the languages of developing economies, will give children better opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, every school will teach different languages.
Some schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered more important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a choice of languages in independent schools, which have specialised teachers in this field.
Scotland's independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may hold.
It cannot be denied today that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be extremely important for the future of the country, so this reality should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered truly "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, multiculturalism and excellence for Scotland's young people.
They have to.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council.
LeBron will make his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego.
The fans' longing to see LeBron make his first appearance with the Los Angeles Lakers has almost come to an end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play Sunday in the first preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it has not yet been decided how many minutes he will play.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton told the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudel tweeted that James will likely play a few minutes.
After practice a few days ago, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game schedule before the season.
"I don't need prep games at this stage of my career to prepare", he said.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is kicking off a series of rallies starting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five planned Trump rallies next week, which include tours to friendly neighborhoods like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With his confirmation vote for the Supreme Court pending, Trump is seeking to bolster popular support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress in the November vote.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 pm ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to refer to this week's hearings on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which have been held in a tense atmosphere over allegations of sexual misconduct, with a Senate confirmation vote put on hold for up to a week while the FBI investigation is ongoing.
However, the primary purpose of this series of rallies is to help Republicans facing a lopsided outcome in the November election gain some momentum.
So, President Trump's campaign staff said that these five rallies next week are intended to "mobilize volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their Senate and House majorities", according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so critical to his agenda that the president is traveling to as many states as possible as we head into the busy campaign period", a Trump campaign spokesman, who asked not to be named, told Reuters.
The gathering scheduled for tonight at Wheeling's Wesbanco Arena could bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract Pittsburgh media coverage", according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time this month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state that won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrissey, the West Virginia Republican candidate for the Senate, who is running low in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has to come and try to give him a push in the polls", said Simon Heder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA has the stamina to fight and keep hope alive as they head into Sunday's singles.
After three one-sided games, Saturday afternoon's foursome might have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging momentum hang is a completely invented athletic concept, but the players believe it deeply, and especially in such a match.
Where would they say the pulse is now?
"They were six points ahead and now they're four ahead, so we probably have a little bit of momentum", said Jordan Spith as he left for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of being four points ahead and with twelve more to play.
The Americans, as Spith says, feel the "wind in their sails" and have much to cheer them on, like the duo of Spith and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each got three points out of four.
Spith was deadly from the tee to the green and setting an example.
The cheers grew louder as he continued his round, striking a crucial four-square to take the game when he and Thomas were down two after two.
The game-winning shot on the 15th was accompanied by a similar cheering that showed his belief that the American team is not out.
"You have to look deep inside and worry about your own game", said Spith.
It's what every player has left behind.
18 holes to make history.
The only players with more points than Spith and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup legends.
The odd but adorable pair of Europe has got four out of four and it seems like they're doing nothing wrong.
The "Mollywood" were the only duo not to hit bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
This game, and the way the energy seems to flow to and from the noisy spectators, seals the fact that it is the players who will have to win on Sunday and that there is no player more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari to seal a possible European victory as the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
The debate on European glory is premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson put the glasses on Sergio Garcia, the hero of this morning's fourball, when he played alongside Alex Noreen.
With a bogey and two doubles on the front nine they stuck the Spaniard and the Swede so deep in a hole they couldn't get out of it.
But on Sunday, there'll be no one to help you out of your hole.
Fourball and foursome are such exciting games to watch up close because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and how a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has been playing better as a team so far and has a significant lead on the final day, but this foursome also showed that Team USA has the guts, despite some doubts.
Europe takes the 10-6 lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after its lead in Saturday's fourball and foursome with 10-6 against the USA.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari stormed in with two wins over a struggling Tiger Woods and managed to take the lead in Le Golf National by four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, trying to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the goalless American side in the morning fourball, with a 3-1 series.
The USA held the foursome to a greater degree, winning two matches, but could not close the gap.
Jim Furyk's side need eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, and along with Molinari, known as "Mollywood", after a rousing weekend, they are only the second pair to win four points in the first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reid in four-ball, they joined forces to take down a tired Woods and American newcomer Bryson DeSabo with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who was dragged into Saturday's two matches, showed occasional bursts of brilliance, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourball and foursome and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested for the fourball matches, returned to his teammate Henrik Stenson for the foursome with 2&1 defeats to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepka, taking first and third place in the world rankings.
All was not well for Europe, despite a pleasant, cool day southwest of Paris.
Three-time champion Jordan Speth and Justin Thomas set the American record with two points on Saturday.
They won a hard 2&1 victory over Spain's John Ram and Ian Poulter in fourball and later came back to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in foursome after losing both holes in the opening.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team recovered from a four-point loss in the singles, although as the winner, Furyk needs a draw to retain the trophy.
However, after being in second place for two days, it seems that a counterattack on Sunday is out of their reach.
North Korea says it will not disarm unilaterally without confidence-building measures
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions deepen the feeling of distrust towards the US and that his country is not going to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong-ho told the world body's annual general assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" in the past year, such as halting nuclear and ballistic tests, divesting of nuclear test facilities, and committing to nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the US", he said.
"Without trust in the U.S., there will be no trust in our national security, and under such conditions there is no way to unilaterally begin our disarmament".
While Ri reiterated North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded as it gradually progresses through the process, his statement was significant in that it did not completely rule out unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work towards the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees for North Korean security.
North Korea is seeking to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first "hand over" its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for the easing of tough international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The US insists on denuclearization first and is increasing pressure by threatening sanctions to achieve their goal by blackmailing, hindering and even ending the war", Ri said.
"The notion that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream of those who do not know us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions deepen our mistrust".
Ri made no reference to a planned second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader pointed out at the UN earlier this week.
The minister, however, pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the partner in the denuclearization issue had been South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead end".
Even so, Ri's tone was very different from last year when he told the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea's ballistic missile targeting of the U.S. mainland was inevitable because "Evil President" Trump had dismissed Kim as a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in moving forward with disarmament measures, but said more needed to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timeline for it, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures it has taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue intensively and uninterruptedly until complete, final and verified denuclearization is achieved".
The Security Council unanimously approved sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an effort to neutralize funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, only for North Korea to denounce him a few hours later as having "the demands of a gangster".
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear complex if the United States took "corresponding measures".
He said Kim told him that the "compensatory measures" he was seeking were security guarantees Trump promised Singapore and promoting normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking classes on how to get enough rest
This year, a new course at Harvard University is urging all undergraduates to get more sleep in an effort to combat the growing culture of the over-night study crowd by consuming a lot of caffeine.
One academic found that students at the world's top universities often do not know basic things, such as how to care for themselves.
Charles Chaisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a resident physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the class after hearing a talk about the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
"Finally, a girl came to me and said, 'Why am I only learning about this now, in my senior year?'
She said that no one had ever talked to her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me", she told The Telegraph newspaper.
The class, which began its first year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance, as well as to improving general well-being.
Paul Barrera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to include the course when it found that students were sleep deprived during the week to a significant degree.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
One section shows a picture of a dorm room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how sports performance is affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to reflect on their daily routine.
"We know it won't change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke", added Professor Chaisler.
The culture of boasting about studying all night is still alive, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students means that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Getting enough, good-quality sleep should be the students' "secret weapon" to combat stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, since sleep deprivation puts the brain in a state of starvation, resulting in a constant feeling of hunger.
Raymond Shaw, a 19-year-old Californian student of chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Chisel design the course, having attended one of his classes last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said that the class opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a class all over the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to require all graduate students to take a similar program before they begin their studies at this highly competitive educational institution.
Professor Chaisler recommended that students set a bedtime alarm and an alarm for waking hours, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston - Rangers 1-0: Menga scores a goal for Gerrard 's men and the team is in the lead .
The Rangers suffered another dismal away defeat as Dolly Menga's shot led Steven Gerrard's uncoordinated side to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
Ibrox's side were looking to record their first away win since their 4-1 triumph in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving the side eight points behind Ladbrokes's top-ranked Hearts.
Menga struck seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers' spirited roster seemed unable to respond.
While Rangers now drop to sixth, Livingston climb to third, just one goal clear of the leading Hibernian.
And the Rangers may have more trouble, as Supervisor Callum Spence had to receive first aid for a head injury caused by an object that was thrown off the platform.
Gerard made eight changes to the squad and overwhelmed Ayr in the semi-finals for the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same composition of "Levy 11" that took a point from Hartz last week and would have been happy with how this well-oiled machine could suppress any attempt of the opponents.
The Rangers may have dominated the possession, but Livingston did more with the ball.
He should have scored in the second minute, when Menga's first long pass sent Scott Pittman into Alan McGregor's area, but the midfielder couldn't find the ball.
A deep free-throw by Keegan Jacobs found captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive teammate Alan Lithgow could only send the ball away from the post.
The Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in the game in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he should have won a penalty in the 15th minute as he collided with Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thompson ignored the Colombian's complaints.
Rangers had only two shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not at all alarmed by Lashana Koulibaly's header and Ovi Ejazariya's sub-par shot.
Although in the first 34 minutes of the match Livvy was clearly below expectations, no one can deny that she deserved the victory for the effort alone.
Once again, the Rangers have failed to address the Jacobs problem.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his composure and found Menga who simply completed the effort.
Gerard made a change at halftime, taking out Koulibaly and putting in Ryan Kent, and the change paid off almost immediately as the winger passed the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran out of his line to block it.
However, Livingston continued to lure the guests into the style of play she knows and enjoys, with Lithgow and Halkett removing the long ball one after the other.
Holt's side could have increased the gap towards the end, but McGregor faced straight ahead Jacobs, stopping him before Lithgow's attempt from the corner.
Rangers' substitute Glenn Middleton had another penalty kick towards the end as he collided with Jacobs, but again Thompson ignored it.
The inventor of the Geiger counter
A page from the Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882: like today, 136 years ago and BEFORE... the day in Germany the future physicist Johann Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radiation, this invention eventually led to the device now known as the Geiger counter.
A pillar of science ever since, Geiger counter has passed into the realm of pop culture, as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, starring the incredible cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive metallic elements, such as uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you hear the action of the atoms caused by the radiation on the metallic elements".
Evans: "Look at that, he's going crazy!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
Yet, the invention that bears his name continues its work.
New cancer vaccine teaches immune system to "see" troubled cells
New cancer vaccine teaches immune system to "see" problem cells and kill them
A vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize problem cells in the treatment setting
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and modifying them in the laboratory
They can "see" a protein that's common in several cancers and then be re-injected
A vaccine under trial is showing promising results in patients with various cancers.
One woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize problem cells saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, modifying them in the laboratory to "see" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzowski, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, stated: "The results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine on our hands".
As Professor Berzowski explained, HER2 "is the driving force behind the development of several types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung, and colon cancers.
A similar approach in which immune cells are extracted from patients and then "taught" how to target cancer cells has been used to treat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West defended Trump, wearing a MAGA hat, after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go very well.
Kanye West was booed off the stage during a Saturday Night Live interview after an off-the-record interview in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for re-election in 2020.
After performing his third song of the night, Ghost Town, in which he wore a baseball cap with the slogan Make America Great Again, he gave a parody recital against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"A lot of times I talk to a white guy and he says, 'How do you like Trump? He's racist.'
If I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago", he said.
SNL opened with a sketch starring Matt Damon, with the Hollywood star parodying Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding Christine Blaze Ford's allegations of sexual abuse.
Although it was not broadcast, the video of West's delirium was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to mock West with this post.
Also, West complained to the audience that he was not treated well backstage because of his hat.
"I got bowled backstage.
They said, "Don't go out with the hat".
I was bowled over!
And they say I don't know what's wrong with me", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm going to wear the Superman cape, because then no one can tell me what to do.
Taste the love".
His comments were condemned at least twice by the audience, and the SNL staff seemed to be in a difficult position, Variety reported, with one person declaring to the magazine: "There was dead silence throughout the studio".
West was called in as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused a lot of people when he sang "I Love It" dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by Candace Turner, head of the conservation group TPUSA, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: WE WANT YOU TO BE RIGHT AGAINST THIS OFFICIAL".
However, the show's host, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was just "himself and that's great".
"But I choose NOT to reward (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their 'art') someone who I believe embraces and speaks out an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So are we", he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he is now "the being formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P. Didi.
Rapper Snoop Dogg had changed his name to Snoop Lion and of course music legend Prince had changed his name first to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known As Prince.

A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after stabbing a man at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.

The charges will be investigated by the prosecutor's office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington is criticizing toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is best known for his role as the swordsman Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series HBO, Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor decries the macho hero stereotype, saying that such roles on screen send the message to young boys that they will have to be tough to earn respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture magazine, Keith said "something is wrong" and wondered how to combat the problem of toxic masculinity in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he has "strong opinions" on the matter.
"Personally, now, I really believe it. Where did we go wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What are we learning in men as they grow up, in relation to the problem we see now?"
Kitt believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity because of the masculine characters it promotes.
He went on: "What is innate and what is taught?
What is it that is taught on television and in the streets that makes young boys feel that they must exhibit such behavior to be men?
I think it's one of the great questions of our time: How can we change it?
Clearly something is wrong with our young people".
In the interview he also admitted that he has no plans to star in any Game of Thrones prequels or sequels after the series ends next summer, saying "no more battles and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will star in a revival of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his wife Rose is the best thing he's ever done on Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on the show, so in a way she gave me my future family and my life from now on", he said.
Rose played Ugret, the love-hate of Jon Snow, the character played by Kit, in the Emmy-winning series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
In the country, more than 820,000 people are affected, according to health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of cases, the new cases were transmitted through sexual contact, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in parts of China through transfusions of contaminated blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way had almost gone down to zero, as Chinese health officials stated at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, compared with the previous year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a very serious issue for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains common.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of transmission of these diseases are due to insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of its effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an executive leaked data on Republican senators, condemns "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
This Saturday, U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters denied allegations that a member of her staff posted personal information of three Republican senators on the lawmaker's Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat argued that the allegations were being promoted by "far-right" commentators and websites.
"Lies, lies and more horrible lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information reportedly includes the home addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch of Utah.
The information surfaced online on Thursday and appears to have been posted by an unknown individual from the Catskill Hill community during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak happened sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was linked to Waters' office and published the details of a Waters staff member, The Hill reported.
"This unsubstantiated claim is completely untrue and a blatant lie", Waters continued.
"The member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised because of these fraudulent and false allegations was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and a blatant lie".
Waters' statement was quickly criticized online, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleisher.
"This denial is full of anger", wrote Fleisher.
"It shows he doesn't have the guts to be a member of Congress.
When a man is accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't be angry.
He mustn't be a coward.
The motives of the accuser must not be questioned.
He must be calm and peaceful".
Fleisher appeared to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by his critics of appearing too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate seeking to unseat Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"It's huge if it's real", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified "the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities of these false allegations".
"We will do everything to find those responsible", he continued, "and hold them accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to any and all of my staff".
Review of the film Johnny English Strikes Back - a low-key spy film starring Rowan Atkinson
It's now a tradition to look for signs of Brexit in every new British character film, and that seems to be true in this revival of the Johnny English action-comedy film franchise, which began in 2003 with the film Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English: The Return.
Can this self-deprecating, self-deprecating, self-deprecating, self-deprecating, self-deprecating, self-deprecating, self-deprecating, self-deprecating, self-deprecating, self-deprecating, self-deprecating, self-deprecating, self-deprecating, self-deprecating, self-deprecating, self-deprecating, self-deprecating, self-deprecating, self-deprecating, self-deprecating, self-deprecating, self-deprecating, self-deprecating, self-deprecating, self-deprecating, self-deprecating, self-deprecating self-deprecating self-deprecating self-deprecating self-deprecating self-deprecating self-deprecating self-deprecating self-deprecating self-deprecating self-deprecating self
In any case, the inept, squint-eyed Johnny Inglis was able to renew his license to make a second time, his name implying that it is a broader comic creation designed for non-English-speaking movie audiences.
This is, of course, the grim undercover agent who, while pretending to have the glitz and manner of a secret agent, does have a bit of Clouseau in him, with a touch of Mr. Bean and something of the guy who played a single note on the theme of the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony for The Paths of Fire.
It is also based on the traveller and international mystery man once played by Atkinson in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, sowing chaos in his wake.
There are one or two good moments in this latest J.E. film.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing medieval armor and the propellers hit his helmet.
Atkinson shows his talent in comedy, however, the humour is quite understated and oddly exaggerated, especially as "serious" film franchises such as 007 and Mission Impossible now include quite a few comic elements.
The humor seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and, in my opinion, Johnny English's wild reversals are not as inventive and relevant as Atkinson's silent-film type sketches of Bean.
The perennial theme is that Great Britain has a serious problem.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret online spy network, exposing the identities of every British agent on assignment, much to the dismay of the agent on duty, played by Kevin Eldon in a role sadly small for his stature.
It's the last straw for a pompous and ambitious prime minister who is on the verge of collapse due to political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does the best she can with this Theresa May-like character, but the script doesn't help her much.
Intelligence advisors inform her that, as every active spy has been exposed, she will have to bring back someone disarmed.
And that means Johnny English, who now works as a principal at some aristocratic school, but gives informal lessons to undercover agents: here are some nice scenes, as English offers a spy academy like A School Too Rock.
English returns to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and is reunited with Buff's former and now-deceased partner, played again by Ben Miller.
Buff is now married to a submarine commander, a crazy role that Vicky Pepperdine doesn't quite get to play.
So Batman and Robin of the scoop for Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, meeting the beautiful and fateful Ofelia Bulutova played by Olga Kirilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously fascinated by the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's tech woes: the menacing Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacey.
Inglis and Buff begin their farce-comedy odyssey: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a posh French restaurant, cause mayhem as they attempt to board Volta's luxury yacht illegally, and Inglis provokes anarchy as he attempts to use a virtual reality device to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's home.
All the tricks are used in this last scene, but as adorable and loud as it is, it still has a little bit of a children's TV vibe.
It's just a little thing.
And as with the other Johnny English films I wonder: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he can really flourish with his talent?
Labour denies that they are considering a plan to make the British work four days, but be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is set to consider a radical plan to get the British to work four days a week, but be paid for five days work.
The party reportedly seeks corporate bosses to funnel the savings achieved through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off.
Thus, employees will enjoy a three-day weekend without any reduction in their wages.
Sources say the idea is in line with the economic agenda and the party's plans to turn the tide in favour of the workers.
The change to a four-day week was approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "A change of policy is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but the four-day workweek is an ambition aligned with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers, as well as the party's overall strategy for industry".
Labour is not the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week in its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this view is not currently supported by the whole of the Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day week is not a party policy and is not being discussed by the party".
Shadow government secretary John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to develop his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he's determined to take back power from the "directors on the board" and the "profiteers" in the utilities.
The shadow cabinet secretary's plans also mean that current shareholders in the water companies may not get their entire share back, as a potential Labour government could make "holds" over suspected fraud.
It also confirmed plans to place employees on company boards and to set up mutual funds to give 10% of private sector companies to employees who would receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are on 60 Minutes talking about whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination by at least a week and raises the question of whether the bureau's findings could influence some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley, a correspondent for 60 Minutes, asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could leak anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Yes, of course", said Kennedy.
"I said that on the way to the hearing, I spoke with Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, when the complaint came out, and I asked him directly: "Did you do it?"
He was steadfast, determined, decisive".
However, Graham's vote seems unlikely to change.
"I've made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and it's going to take some kind of explosive indictment to change my mind", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett vehemently denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blazy Ford.
"And whoever named it can't confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new changing".
What is the Global Citizen Festival and how much has it helped reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a rich program and well-known stars, but also an equally impressive mission: the eradication of global poverty.
For the seventh year in a row, tens of thousands are expected to flock to Central Park's Great Lawn as part of the Global Citizen Festival, not only to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's real goal, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international lobbying group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight against it.
To secure a free ticket to the event (unless they were willing to buy a VIP ticket), participants had to complete a series of missions or "actions", such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or finding other meaningful ways to help raise awareness about their goal to end poverty.
But how successful is Global Citizen with 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding a free concert the right way to persuade our fellow citizens to take action, or is it just another case of so-called "click-activism", where people feel they are really making a difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen reports that it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters, advancing a range of different goals.
It reports that these actions helped world leaders announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which are set to affect the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the Group reported 390 commitments and announcements as a result of these actions, of which at least USD 10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the secured funds have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key pledges include The Power of Nutrition, a British association of investors and practitioners, who have pledged to "help children reach their full potential", pledging to give Rwanda $35 million to eliminate malnutrition, having received over 4,700 tweets from members of the Global Citizens community.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and members of the Global Citizens community like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history", Tracy Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told the audience during the live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that following more than 5,000 actions calling for the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project called The Power of Nutrition, which is targeting 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
Answering the question "what makes you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?" which is included in the FAQs of the website,
a member of the Global Citizen community responded: "The road will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like all the great human rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we are stronger united.
Janet Jackson, Wicked, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mona are among the artists who will be performing at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Farnes and Hugh Jackman.
US can use Navy for blockade by blocking Russian energy exports - Home Minister
Washington may turn to its Navy "if necessary" to block Russian energy supply to markets including the Middle East, as US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reasons they are in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy, just like they do in eastern and southern Europe", he reportedly said.
According to the Minister, there are ways and means to counter Russian activity.
"The United States has the ability, with the support of the Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes remain open and, if necessary, to block them, to ensure that Russian energy is not put on the market", he said.
Zinke was addressing the audience at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that has been described as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He criticized Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, to replace and replenish fuels", he said, referring to Russia as "a one-trick pony" because it has an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
The remarks come as the Trump administration has taken on the mission of boosting exports of American LNG to Europe, replacing Russia, which is the much cheaper option for European consumers.
For this reason, the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump himself, is trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unsuitable" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that, according to Trump, will make Berlin a "spook" for Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, an $11 billion project that is set to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's strong opposition to the project is motivated by economic considerations and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool of coercion and that consumers should be able to choose the gas supplier they want", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US stance provoked the reaction of Germany, which stressed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to back off from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider running for the presidency in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she will seriously consider running for president after the midterm elections.
At a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering it.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that's why we need a woman at the top", she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will consider a possible candidacy for the presidency".
Warren criticized President Donald Trump during the meeting, saying he was "leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren didn't mince words about Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday, Warren said that "of course an FBI investigation is necessary before the vote".
A poll released on Thursday, however, showed that a majority of Warren's voters don't believe she should run for president in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts "potential" voters said the senator should not run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent were in favor of such a nomination.
The poll showed more support for a possible candidacy than former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favor of a possible candidacy and 48% against.
Other popular names from the Democrats discussed in connection with a possible 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said he would make a formal decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin was referring to Trac Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder at the Donald Trump rally.
Truck Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his deployment in September.
Arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"With what my son has been going through since he's returned, I can understand other families living with the effects of PTSD and the injuries our soldiers carry when they come home", she told an audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as "a bomb ready to go off", and said of her son and other veterans that they "come back a little different, come back harder, come back wondering if there's any respect for what soldiers, airmen and every other member of the military has done for the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interfering with a domestic violence report, and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support challenging the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims trying to escape gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the District filed an amicus curiae brief Friday in Washington supporting an asylum seeker challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name in the suit Grace v. Sessions filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and his violent sons who are gang members" abused her, however, U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
He was held in Texas.
Lawyers for the states supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which are home to a large number of asylum seekers in the U.S., as countries with intense problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed the 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) and allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney Carl Racine of the District of Columbia said Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"Under federal law, all asylum claims must be considered on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the claim. Such a barrier violates this principle", according to the amicus curiae brief.
The lawyers also claimed in the report that the policy of denying entry to immigrants harms the US economy, making the claim that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "form a necessary workforce".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims trying to escape domestic violence and gang situations.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or intimidation due to race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his June 11 policy statement.
The purpose of asylum was never to alleviate all the problems (even the most serious) that people face daily around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the death toll doubles despite the struggle to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"It's very intense", said 35-year-old mother Riza Kusuma, trying to comfort her baby with a fever at an evacuation center set up in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulances bring more bodies.
Clean water is scarce".
Some residents attempted to return to their destroyed homes and to gather their belongings from the water, trying to salvage whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake, were unable to cope.
Some wounded, such as Duy Harris, who suffered a fractured waist and shoulder, remained outside the Army Hospital in Palo, where first aid was being given in the countryside because of the ongoing strong aftershocks.
Tears flooded his eyes as he related how he felt the violent earthquake shake the fifth-floor room of the hotel he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was trapped in the debris of the wall", Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my kid.
I hope they're safe".
US ambassador accuses China of "intimidation" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a US daily newspaper touting the mutual commercial benefits between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread its propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the paid insert of the China Daily that appeared in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's top-selling newspaper, after it accused China of seeking to meddle in the November 6 congressional elections, a charge China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to meddle in the US election marked what US officials told Reuters is a new phase in the escalating campaign launched by Washington to pressure China.
Although foreign governments are not prohibited from running ads to promote their trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war and have imposed various import tariffs on each other.
China's tariff retaliations in the early days of the trade war were aimed at hitting exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former long-serving governor of Iowa, a state that is a major agricultural exporter to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, as Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in the Sunday Des Moines Register, "is engaging in this kind of intimidation by running propaganda ads in our free press".
"In an effort to spread this propaganda, the Chinese government is exploiting America's cherished tradition of free speech and free press by publishing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in the Beijing pulpits, you will find few dissenting voices and no true representation of the different views that the Chinese people may have on China's troubled economic course, given that the media is under the control of the Communist Party of China", he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers has declined the offer to publish" his article, though he did not say which one.
Republicans alienate female voters ahead of midterm elections because of the Kavanaugh fiasco, analysts warn
As many leading Republicans continue to defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh despite allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn there will be a backlash, particularly from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
Sentiments on this issue are highly tense and most Republicans have stated that they would like to proceed with the vote.
These things can't be fixed", Grant Rearer, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in reference to an article published Saturday.
Reyer doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute move to request an FBI investigation will be enough to appeal to angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday, they are not going to forget it tomorrow, and they are certainly not going to forget it in November", Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, said Friday, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" in the Senate corridor as Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee gave the green light to Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blazy Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will reach record levels", Stu Rodenberg, an unbiased political analyst, told the news site.
"They say it's already high, and that's true.
But it could be higher, especially among the group of undecided women voters in the suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who, while disliking the president, often don't vote".
Even before Ford's public testimony in which she detailed her allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had predicted that there might be a backlash if Republicans went ahead with the nomination.
"It's a huge mess for the Republican Party", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is going to be voted out, it's about how Republicans handled the issue and how they handled it", Guy Cecil, director of the Priorities USA team that helps Democrats get elected, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided on who to believe after the testimony of Fortin and Kavanaugh, leaning slightly more in favor of the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41% of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35% said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
Further, 38% said they believed Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied in his testimony, while only 30% said the same for Ford.
Following Flack's move, the FBI has taken on the task of investigating Ford's claims and at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her while drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals at a party when they were both students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a startup with the goal of competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The newest addition to this technology legend is Inrupt, a company based on Berners-Lee's open-source Solids platform.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data is stored, and who can access and what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now", he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment.
The application uses the Solid platform technology allowing users to create their own "personal electronic data storage" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all being available in one browser and all of them at the same time.
The unique feature of the personal electronic data storage space is that it allows the user to decide who has access to what kind of information.
The company calls this capability "personal empowerment through data".
The idea behind Inrupt, according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, is that the company provides resources, processes and appropriate skills to make the Solid platform available to everyone.
The company consists of Berners Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought from IBM, some contracted programmers who worked on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can build their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt's website.
Berners Lee said that he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about whether they're allowed to make radical changes, overturning business models overnight.
"We do not ask their permission".
In a Medium post released on Saturday, Berners Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide a commercial energy and ecosystem that will protect the integrity and quality of new web created on the Solid platform".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a strong voice in the debate about net neutrality.
Even with Inrupt, Berners Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the Internet", added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Van: Tribute to a clergyman who received the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only Anglican clergyman to have received the Victoria Cross during World War I as a soldier was honoured in his homeland 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Van was awarded the medal on 29 September 1918, for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had been awarded Britain's highest military decoration.
On Saturday, a memorial plaque was unveiled by his two grandchildren, accompanied by a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was "extremely symbolic" that the plaque's unveiling came exactly 100 years after his grandfather's heroic act for which he received the medal.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion into the St. Kentigern Canal in very dense fog and while receiving heavy fire from machine guns and machine guns".
Later, he rushed to the front line and with "extraordinary courage" led the line forward before single-handedly striking three of the detachment with a battle rifle.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, almost a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's heroic deeds were "something I know I could never achieve, something that makes you feel boundless respect".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said that he "felt greatly honored to be part of the parade" and added that "the bravery of a true hero is evidenced by the support he has from many people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, but they saw Peppa the Pig.
Consider the following scenario: You have stayed up late to watch the thrilling Bellator 206, but you are denied the joy of seeing this unique sporting event.
The San Jose schedule included 13 matches, including six on the main card, and was to be shown live in the UK, by Channel 5, in the night-time slot.
At 6:00 a.m., as Gergard Musashi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to take the ring, the UK audience was stunned when the broadcast was changed to Peppa the Worm.
Some were not happy at all, having stayed up until the wee hours of the morning especially for the game.
One Twitter fan described the screening of the children's program as "some kind of sick joke".
"By law, this content was not appropriate for 6 a.m., so the children's program had to be shown", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the Pig, that is".
Bellator president Scott Cocker said they were going to revamp the program to include UK viewers in the future.
"Given the backlash, I think we can pull it off", Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock on Sunday morning there and we won't be able to do it until Sunday our time, which is their Monday.
But we're trying to.
Believe me, when the switch was made, there was a lot of back and forth and it wasn't friendly.
We tried to fix it, thought it was a technical error.
It wasn't, it was the regulations.
I promise you, next time, this won't happen.
We're gonna limit it to five games instead of the usual six, because we tried to give the fans more, and we went too far.
It is an unpleasant situation".
Tom Daley felt "inferior" because of his sexuality
Olympic diving champion Tom Daly said he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but it pushed him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said that it wasn't until high school that he realized that "not everyone is like me".
Speaking on the first Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne on Radio 4, she said she supported gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that since he became a parent, he's less interested in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, a regular on the popular radio show, had been on sick leave for several months.
As a guest on Laverne's first show, Dailey said he felt "inadequate" compared to others when he was growing up because "it was not socially acceptable to like both boys and girls".
She stated: "To this day, those feelings of inferiority and otherness have given me the strength and the will to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was "something", he said, so he wouldn't disappoint anyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist is a prominent advocate for LGBTQ rights and used his participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to move towards decriminalizing homosexuality.
He said he decided to speak out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly, without consequences, and that he wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said it was "a surprise" when she fell in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013.
Daley married Oscar winner Dustin Lance Black last year, who is 20 years his senior, but he claimed the age difference was never an issue.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" (he first competed in the Olympics at the age of 14, while his father died of cancer three years later) "it's hard to find a peer who has similar ups and downs".
The couple adopted a son in June, Robert Ray Black-Dailey, and Dailey said it changed "his whole outlook".
"If you asked me last year, all I wanted was to win the gold medal", he said.
"But there are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son shares the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daily said that his father didn't accept the fact that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked about was if they had tickets for the 2012 Olympics in London, as he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'Dad, you won't be around to sit in the front row,'" she said.
"I held his hand as he stopped breathing, and only when he stopped breathing and was dead did I finally accept that he was not invincible", he said.
The following year, Daly competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life, to compete in diving at the Olympics in my homeland, there was no better feeling", he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song, Heather Small's Proud, which cheered him up in his preparation for the Olympics and still gives him chills.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out of shape Mickelson will be sitting on the bench Saturday at the Ryder Cup .
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he'll need to improve his performance so he's not remembered for the wrong reasons.
Mickelson, who is competing in his 12th (and record) biennial, was forced by captain Jim Furyk to sit on the bench for Saturday's fourball and foursomes.
Instead of being in the center of the action, as is customary for the United States, the five-time winner divided the day between cheering from the sidelines and "working" his game in the hope that it would correct his problematic points.
Never the most straight driver even in the prime of his career, the 48-year-old's game is not suited to the narrow course of Le Golf National, where long shots are often problematic.
And as if the difficulty of the court wasn't enough, Mickelson, in his ninth match on Sunday, faces Francesco Molinari, the British Open champion, who is teaming up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, who were four points off the start of the 12 singles, can take the lead with a good start, Mickelson's play could be crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood the role he was playing today, gave me a friendly pat on the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready for tomorrow", Furik said.
"He has a lot of confidence.
His name is in the Hall of Fame and he's contributed so much to these teams, both in the past and this week.
I guess I didn't count on him playing two games.
I was thinking more, but that's where we ended up and so we thought we had to go.
He wants to go out there like everybody else".
Mickelson is going to break Nick Faldo's record for most Sunday matches in the Ryder Cup.
It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that didn't quite reach his personal best.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk stated that his presence was a benefit to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to make jokes and is great in the team room", she explained.
"I think the younger players also had fun teasing him this week.
His contribution is not just to the game".
The European team's captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows that the long lead may soon be lost.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a big lead that starts with the last day's singles at the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a loss.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 race at Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros managed to take a five-point advantage over the Americans, but barely managed to cross the finish line by breaststroke, winning 141⁄2- 131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama, we had a big lead at Brookline where we lost, and at Valderrama where we won, but barely", Bjorn said, pictured after watching the 2018 generation win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday and lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and all the members of this team that this is not over.
We're going in there tomorrow, ready to go all out.
We're gonna go out there and play it right.
Nothing is over until you see the grades on the board.
We have one goal, to win this trophy, and that's what we're focused on.
I always say that I focus on our 12 players, but we know very well that there are equally good players on the other team - the best in the world".
Satisfied with his players' performance on a difficult golf course, Bjorn adds: "I would not be in a hurry to predict the outcome.
Tomorrow is another beast.
Tomorrow, it's individual performance that counts, and that's something different.
It's great to be on the court with a teammate when things are going well, but when you're out there on your own, that's when you really test your golf skills.
That's the message you need to give the players, how to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
You leave your teammate behind and he has to give it his all and show his best self".
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk of the opposing team will require his players to score better individual performances than they did with their teammates, except for Jordan Speth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four.
Furyk himself has experienced both ends of the last day's ups and downs, as he was part of the winning team at Brookline before the unexpected defeat, as Europe performed its miracle.
"I remember every word of it", he replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had assembled his players for the final day.
"We have 12 big games tomorrow, but we want a quick start like in Brookline, like in Medinah.
When we get that momentum, there's a lot of pressure on the midfield.
We decide our order accordingly and play in the order that suits us, we'll try to do our magic tomorrow".
Thomas has taken over the lead of the race and faces Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rham, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the rest of the Europeans in the top half of the line.
"I went with this group with this lineup because I think it covers the whole track", Bjorn said justifying his choices for singles.
Another delay for Germany's new battleship
The new German Navy frigate was supposed to have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the aging warships of the Cold War era, but it is not going to be commissioned until at least next year, due to faulty systems and inflated costs, local media reports.
The commissioning of the frigate Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which cites a representative of the armed forces.
The ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but problems with delivery were critical to the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the older Bremen-class frigates.
They will carry powerful cannons, an array of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features are that the frequency of maintenance work is reduced, as it will be possible to use the new frigates for up to two years outside German ports.
However, the continuing delays mean that although the warships are considered state-of-the-art, allowing Germany to show its strength abroad, by the time they are finally commissioned they will already be obsolete, notes Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy formally refused to take the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipyard after its surrender.
Not much information has been released about the reasons for the return, but the German media reported a number of significant "software and hardware defects" that would render the warship useless if used in a combat mission.
The software problems were particularly significant, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships have a crew of about 120 sailors, just half as compared to the older Bremen-class frigates.
It was also revealed that the ship has a much higher weight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz frigate is believed to have twice the weight of ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from faulty equipment, the cost of the whole project (including crew training) was also an issue.
It is said to have reached the hefty sum of €3.1 billion (€3.6 billion), while the original budget was €2.2 billion.
The problems plaguing the new frigates are particularly significant as Germany's naval power shrinks.
Earlier this year, Hans Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the Navy "will soon have no ships for missions".
The official said that the problem has grown over time, as the old ships have been decommissioned but there are no new ships to replace them.
He claimed that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust is eavesdropping on the secret life of the bats.
New research conducted on a farm in the Highlands of Scotland seeks to reveal how bats use the landscape when hunting for food.
The findings will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help to plan future actions to protect the environment.
The study by National Trust for Scotland scientists will investigate the habits of the common nano- and micro-bat, as well as the brown octopus and the Dobbendoon myotis in the Inverewe Gardens, Wester Ross.
Special trackers will be placed at key locations around the farm to monitor bat activities throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile searches using handheld detectors.
Expert analysis of the sound of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the bats' calls, as well as which species have this behavior.
A habitat map and a report will then be produced to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour on a landscape scale.
Rob Duar, conservation adviser for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of grasslands and the best way to conserve forests for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development projects that affect the places where they roost and destroy their habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting are also a danger, as are fly-tipping and some chemical treatments of building materials, and attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes in catching their prey.
They use a sophisticated sonar technique to detect insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres of land throughout the country, considers bats to be very important.
It has ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, inspect bat nesting sites, and sometimes rescue bats.
The organisation has also created Scotland's first and only bat sanctuary on the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The farm's manager, David Thompson, says that the farm is ideal ground for bats.
"Here in Threave we have an excellent area for bats", he said.
"We have the old buildings, many big trees and an ideal habitat.
There's still a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we're doing here and elsewhere will help us better understand what's needed to grow their populations".
It stresses the importance of checking for bats before any conservation work on a home, as the destruction of a single nest with young could kill up to 400 females and young, potentially wiping out the entire local population.
Bats are protected species and it is forbidden to kill them, harass them or disturb their peace, or destroy their nests.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a member of the Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, encouraged the public to help.
He said: "There is much to be learned about our bats, and for many of our species we simply do not know their population evolution".
Ronaldo denies the rape allegations as his lawyers prepare to sue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape allegations against him "fake news", saying that some "want to present themselves" by taking advantage of his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward is accused of raping an American woman, Catherine Mayorca, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
According to the complaint, he allegedly paid her $375,000 to buy her silence and keep her from reporting the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers after the complaint, Ronaldo, 33, called the reports "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to be able to do this.
What they said today is fake news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They want to get ahead and take advantage of my name.
It's only natural.
They want to be famous using my name, but that's part of my job.
I'm happy and all is well", the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for its allegations, which they called "unacceptable reporting of rumors that invade privacy", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Skerts said the player will seek compensation for "moral damage proportionate to the gravity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of privacy in recent years".
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June of 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mallorca returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in an act of violence according to documents filed in the District Court of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" a "good guy", but betrayed him the other "one percent".
The documents say that Ronaldo admits to having sexual intercourse, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and a hospital where her injuries were photographed, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of possible reprisals" and worried about her "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old says she's trying to overturn the settlement, as she continues to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of being signed to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged abuse, and this summer he moved to Italian club Juventus, securing a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'will always regret' the loss of its car industry
The UK will "regret forever" if it loses its reputation as a global leader in the automotive industry after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark has said.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer stated that the impact of cross-border delays in a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The plant in Bernaston, where Toyota's Auris and Avensis models are made, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will be halted", said Marvin Cook, CEO of Toyota in Bernaston.
Other UK carmakers have also expressed fears of a no-deal exit from the EU on cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, has said it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern supply chain risks according to the car industry in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line follows just-in-time. Parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be problems at the border, resulting in delays and shortages of parts according to the sector.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's supply at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would stop.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the protection of the environment and the environment from harmful substances.
"We need a deal, we want the best possible deal that will allow us not just a temporary success, but to take advantage of this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The evidence coming not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers is that it is imperative to ensure the continuity of supply chains".
Toyota was unable to say for how long it would stop production, however, it warned that in the long run the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Bernaston for 24 years and is the Unite union official at the factory, said union members are increasingly worried: "In my experience, if these jobs are lost, they're never coming back.
A government spokesman said: 'We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU'.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House announces
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "delayed another week", as the battle over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, the connections of Trump aides to Russia and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The possibility that Trump could fire the deputy attorney general, jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has been fueling Washington gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a wire to record his conversations with Trump and enable the president's removal under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, last Monday he went to the White House amid reports that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid coinciding with the hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee in which both Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying a vote by the full Senate.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's spokeswoman, appeared on the Fox News Sunday television show.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "The date has not been set yet, it may be this week, but it may be postponed another week given all the other cases the supreme court is dealing with.
But we'll see, and I like to keep the press informed".
Some journalists have disputed this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press briefing since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why this is happening.
Sanders responded that the limited frequency of the updates was not due to dislike of the "impressionistic" moves of TV journalists, although she stated, "I will not argue with the fact that they are showing off".
Then he hinted that there would be increased or direct communication between Trump and the press.
"The president gives more interviews than any previous president", he said, adding without giving details: "We looked at those numbers".
Updates will continue to be made, Sanders said, but "if the press has the ability to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, that's infinitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to implement it often and you've seen that we've implemented it often in the last few weeks and it's going to take the place of the press briefing where you can talk to the President of the United States".
Trump is often questioned when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with state visitors.
Individual press interviews are rare.
This week in New York the president seems to have demonstrated why this is so, with an unconventional and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of a packed press conference.
Health Secretary sends a letter to EU citizens working in Scotland's NHS amid Brexit fears
The Minister for Health has sent a letter to EU citizens employed by the Scottish National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and to wish them to stay on after the UK leaves the European Union.
Jean Freeman, a Scottish Member of Parliament, sent a letter with less than six months to go before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the cost of settled status applications for EU citizens working in its devolved public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: 'Negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continued during the summer and are moving towards expected decisions in the autumn.
However, the UK Government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we would very much like you to stay here".
Christian Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers defensive end Christie Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after sustaining a head injury in Saturday's game, where the Tigers were defeated 31-27 by the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Tennessean reporter Mike Organ.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the bench and just collapsed there", Reed said.
The gymnasts and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the bench and then put him on a stretcher and brought him back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV television station in Nashville, Tennessee that Ambercrombie was out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is "no data yet on the type/extent of the injury" and Tennessee State is trying to establish when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He made five total tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his total to 18 total tackles for the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty for buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty for buying property in the UK, with the extra money used to help the homeless, according to the new Tories' plans
The measure will negate the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
The stamp duty increase will be imposed on those buyers who do not pay UK taxes
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year - to provide aid to the homeless
Foreign buyers will start to be charged a higher stamp duty for buying property in the UK, with the extra money used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to offset the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to lure young voters with promises of more affordable housing and to target the high-wage earners.
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and legal entities not taxed in the UK, while the additional cash amounts will support the government's campaign to combat homelessness.
The surcharge, imposed on the current stamp duty, together with the higher tax rates introduced two years ago for the purchase of second homes and rental homes, can be as high as three percent.
The Treasury expects the measure to yield up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of newly built properties in London are purchased by non-UK residents, leading to higher prices and making it more difficult for first-time buyers to enter the property market.
Many wealthy areas of the country - especially the capital - have become "ghost towns" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the stamp duty so more young people can get their first homes.
He accused the big construction companies of keeping property prices high by acquiring land without using it and called on Mrs May to remove the roofs on affordable housing to restore Britain's "housing affordability".
Mr. Corbin announced a series of spectacular proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and a ban on no-fault evictions.
It also wants to give councils more power to build new homes.
Mrs May said: 'Last year I said I would dedicate my premiership to restoring the British dream - to improving life for each new generation.
And that means fixing the broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it would not be right for non-UK residents and overseas-based companies to buy homes as easily as hardworking British nationals.
For too many people the dream of home ownership has become a distant memory, and the indignity of homelessness remains".
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to coach the Scotland team"
Sunderland captain Jack Ross says that his "ultimate ambition" is to one day become Scotland's national team coach.
The 42-year-old Scot is excited about the challenge of resurrecting the northeast England team, which is currently in third place in League One, three places below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light in the summer, having previously brought St Mirren back to the Scottish Championship the previous season.
"I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I got a call for the second national team and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound radio show.
"But I grew up watching the Scotland team in Hampden all the time with my dad as a kid, and that's something that always drew me back.
But that opportunity will only come if I have success in coaching teams".
Among his predecessors at Sunderland are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neal, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic says he was not surprised when he was asked to succeed such established names to such a big team, having previously rejected approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At this point, success for me will be measured by the answer to the question, 'Can I get this team back into the Premier League?'
"The club is a club of the Premier League, and the structure and facilities of this club make it a Premier League club without question", he said.
"It's not an easy job to get there, but I'll probably only consider myself successful here if I can get the team back there".
Ross began his coaching career just three years ago, having spent a stint as assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell on the coaching staff at Hearts.
He then helped Aloha bounce back from relegation to the third division and led St Mirren from the brink of relegation to the Championship the following season.
Also, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was quite a crossroads", he said, recalling his appointment as coach of Aloha.
"I really thought I was more suited to be a coach than a player.
It sounds strange because I was doing well, making a decent amount of money from it and I had reached quite high.
But playing can be hard.
You have to put up with a lot on a weekly basis.
I'm still struggling with the stress and pressure of the job, but the coaching job suits me perfectly.
I've always wanted to train, and now that I do, I feel more comfortable with myself than I have in my entire adult life".

The best time for beer is 5:30 on Saturdays, according to research.
The summer heat wave has boosted profits for Britain's struggling pubs but brought more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars saw sales up 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant profits fell 4.8 percent, the numbers revealed.
Peter Martin of the business consultancy CGA, which compiled the data, said: "Continued sunshine and a larger-than-expected England World Cup attendance caused July to follow a similar pattern to the previous month, June, where pub profits rose 2.8 percent, but the restaurants took an even bigger hit.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant revenue in June only got worse in July.
Pubs and bars serving alcohol fared better, with the corresponding figures of previous years having gone up more than the corresponding figures of restaurants have fallen.
Pubs serving food also suffered on sunny days, though not as dramatically as restaurants.
It seems like people just want to go out for a drink.
In all the pubs and bars operated, beverage sales were up 6.6 percent for the month, while food sales were down three percent".
Paul Newman, of the leisure and hospitality analyst division of RSM, said: "These results confirm the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors in terms of sales to the non-domestic market.
Not surprisingly, restaurant groups continue to struggle, but a 4.8 percent drop in sales on an annual basis will be especially painful given ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the restaurant business and time will tell if the lower temperatures we experienced in August will give a long-awaited extension".
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new businesses, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand name launches.

One in five children have secret social media accounts, hidden from their parents
As the survey reveals, one in five children - even as young as 11 - maintain secret social-media accounts, hiding them from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in fake Insta pages
This news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of the students said they have a "master" account to show their parents
One in five children - even as young as 11 - create social-media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in fake Insta accounts - a reference to the photo-sharing website Instagram.
This news has heightened fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of the students said that they maintain a healthy "main" account to show their parents, while also maintaining private accounts.
A mother who accidentally found her 13-year-old daughter's secret website, spotted a teenager urging others to rape her ("rape me").
The survey conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in independent schools found that 40 per cent of pupils aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, with half of them admitting to having hidden accounts.
HMC President Mike Buchanan stated: "It is alarming that so many teens are succumbing to the temptation to create online spaces where their parents and teachers cannot locate them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive adviser to the Scottish Athletics Board at the Annual General Meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track athlete and chairman Ian Beattie commented on her election as a great opportunity for those running the sport to benefit from her extensive experience internationally over the last decade.
"Eileen enjoys immense respect throughout the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit immensely from her joining the council", Beatty said.
Doyle said: "I am excited to be the voice of the athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland".
The American, who won gold medals in the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, has won a total of four Olympic gold medals and is now a regular commentator on the BBC, was paralyzed after suffering a paralytic ischemic stroke.
He tweeted: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover.
It was exhausting, but I've fully recovered, I've learned to walk again, and today I'm doing eugenics!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Infant-feeding ad comparing mothers to cows divides online opinion
A breastfeeding company has divided the online public with an ad comparing nursing mothers to cows milking them.
To launch what it calls "the world's first silent, wearable breast pump", consumer-technology company Elvie released a humorous advertisement inspired by a video clip to highlight the freedom the new breast pump offers breast-feeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a cow barn full of hay to a song that includes lyrics like "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see any tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, those aren't tits, they're my boobs".
The chorus continues: "Pump it, pump it, I feed babies, pump it, pump it, I milk my ladies".
However, the ad, posted on the company's Facebook page, has sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, as many say it does not take seriously the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"Very unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their own babies are stolen a few days after birth", commented one.
Elvie's breastplate fits discreetly into a breast-feeding bra
Another commented: "Obviously traumatic for both mother and baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise breastfeeding mothers who can hold their babies?"
Another added: "A totally unrealistic advertisement".
Others defended the ad, while one woman admitted that her song sounded "ridiculous".
"I think it's a very clever idea.
I'd buy a breast pump like that if I was still breast-feeding.
The pumping made me feel just like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I didn't overanalyze it.
It's a very clever product", someone wrote.
Another commented: "It's a funny ad targeting moms who are pumping breast milk (often in their workplace or in toilets) and feel like 'cows.'
It is not an advertisement praising or criticizing the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they were all dancing with their distinctive breastplates tucked inside their bras.
The logic behind the advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women who breast-feed say they feel like cows.
The Elvie breast pump, however, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and fits discreetly inside a breast-feeding bra, allowing women to move around, hold their babies, and even go outside during pumping.
Anna Ballarin, a partner and Executive Creative Director at Mother, commented: "Elvie the Teen is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
Drawing a parallel between lactating women and dairy cows, we wanted to put the focus on the extraction of breast milk and all the challenges involved, while showing in a fun and relatable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new breastfeeding will bring.
This isn't the first time that Elvie's breast has made the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk for fashion designer Marta Yakubovsky while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have quietly moved to a camp on the Texas border.
The number of migrant children in detention has skyrocketed, though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to match children with custodians.
Traditionally, most breadwinners are themselves undocumented immigrants, and they're afraid to come forward and ask for a child and risk their own ability to stay in the country.
The danger intensified in June, when federal authorities announced that prospective dependents and other adult household members would be required to provide fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency has arrested dozens of people who were asked to provide support for unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Almost 80 percent of the persons who are either dependents or dependent household members are in the country illegally and a large number of these are criminal aliens.
The Commission is therefore continuing to pursue these individuals", said Mr Albens.
In an effort to expedite the handling of children's cases, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of these children to appear in court within a month of their detention, rather than within 60 days, as was previously the case, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear via videoconference, rather than in person, to develop their claims for legal status before the immigration judge.
Those deemed not to meet the conditions for exemption will be deported immediately.
The longer children are in detention, the more likely they are to become stressed or anxious, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Advocates said these concerns are heightened in larger facilities like Torneio, where signs that a child is struggling are more likely to go unnoticed, due to the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to the shanty town without giving them enough time to prepare the children psychologically or to say goodbye to their friends can exacerbate the trauma they are already struggling with.
Syria calls for US, French and Turkish "occupying forces" to withdraw immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even as the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will be dealt with appropriately".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that "the war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, while millions more have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "to wage this holy battle until we expel all Syrian terrorists" from both terrorist groups and "every illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily training and briefing both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arab opponents of President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said conditions were good for their return and blamed "some Western countries" for "sowing irrational fears" that pushed refugees to stay away from their country.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns", he said.
"They are politicizing an issue that should be purely humanitarian".
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be given for the reconstruction of Syria unless a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a demilitarized zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity to advance political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a widespread offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Mualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who would be "neutralized".
UN Special Envoy Stephan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meeting of a new government-opposition committee soon to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the committee's work should be limited "to revising articles of the current Constitution" and warned that no interference should be made.
Because Trump is gonna win a second term.
With this logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election again, unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope, the impeachment motion and scandal prematurely ends his presidency.
Which would undoubtedly be "The most dramatic presidential finale of all time!"
So far there's no sign of the spectators' tiredness.
Since 2014, viewership numbers in the high-definition band have more than doubled, to 1.05 million on CNN, and nearly tripled, to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
The Fox News network averages 2.4 million viewers in the prime time zone, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has swept the satellite TV viewing numbers, with 3.5 million viewers on prime time nights.
It's a fire that people are drawn to because it's something we don't understand", said Neal Baer, producer of the ABC drama series "Designated Survivor" in which a cabinet minister becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Neal Scovell, veteran comedy writer and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has a different theory.
He remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
Her driver said she was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
He asked "why?"
"He said, 'Because it makes me laugh,'" Mrs. Scovell said.
One can have fun even with chaos.
Of course, unlike what happens with TV shows, the scripts coming out of Washington can determine the future of Roy v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited, and the health of the global economy.
Frequency change is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can enjoy.
And yet, you surpass the definition of an informed citizen when you sit for six hours watching a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of "infesting backstage interviews" for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 leather strawberry bomber jacket ("a full-length hippo dress", according to the Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels's wildly colorful depictions of Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I, however, will never see Super Mario again in the same way.
"What makes it and what gives you the feel of a reality show is that it gives you something every night", Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the television program "Pawn Stars", said of the constantly changing cast and the daily twists and turns in the plot of Trump's show (he has a falling-out with the N.F.L., praises Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode, or you're gonna be left behind.
When I met with Mr. Fleisch this week, it was a sunny day with 26 degrees Celsius outside his home on the north shore of Kaua'i, but he was locked inside watching MSNBC while CNN was taping.
He couldn't get off, not when Brett Kavanaugh was about to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging in the balance.
"I remember when we did those crazy shows back in the day and people said, 'This is going to be the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleisch told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right after all".

Foreign money is pouring into the most marginal contest for the midterm elections
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District is receiving a cash inflow, thanks to the realignment of Congressional districts that has put two sitting members of Congress in the running for the same position.
This newly redesigned suburban Pittsburgh district is represented by Democratic Representative Connor Lamb, who was elected in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is opposed by another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who represents Pennsylvania's former 12th congressional district, which largely overlaps with the new 17th congressional district.
The maps were redesigned following a Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling in January that the old districts were being manipulated unconstitutionally to the Republican advantage.
The contest in the new 17th district has sparked a campaign of financial competition between the largest party finance departments, the Democratic Campaign Committee for Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became popular in Pennsylvania after winning a landslide victory in a special election contest held in March for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district, which was attended by many.
That seat had been held by Republicans for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political analysts are giving the Democrats a slight head start.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for its support for China, but backed away
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, prompting mild reactions from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and maintained a hotel in Panama until the partners sacked the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials decided to recall the American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan", as Heather Nauert, the agency's spokeswoman, said earlier this month.
However, sanctions were considered only against El Salvador, which is estimated to have received around US$140 million in US aid in 2017, including for drug controls, development and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country, with its high unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, following a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent the passage of refugees into the United States.
But in mid-September, top officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to go ahead, effectively putting an end to any consideration of sanctions on El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is due to address the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a sign of the importance the gathering has for the administration, diplomats said.
All three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any new harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the conversation described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal consultations on condition of anonymity.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Read the history
The next blow may be the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Mr Trump's obstruction of justice, for which very strong evidence has now been made public.
It is rumoured that Mr Mueller is also turning his investigation to the possible collusion between Mr Trump's campaign and Russia in relation to the Russian attack on our election.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will be held accountable before that body as he prepares to run for president again in the next election and perhaps eventually before a jury.
The "ifs" are many and I am not suggesting that the downfall of Mr Trump, or his counterparts in Europe, is inevitable.
There are choices we all have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will determine the duration of this battle.
In 1938 German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler if the West had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the chance to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and the unstoppable march of democracy is accelerated or slowed.
Americans are now facing several of these tipping points.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation in his hands?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since it was reported in that paper last year that he proposed secretly recording the president and that he considered him unfit for the presidency.
Mr. Rosenstein said that the version the Times adopted was inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite substantial allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will enter a long winter.
But, because of the lesson I learned in the act, I believe we will not fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy residence.
He survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later he sent me to light the Jewish Sabbath candles on that swastika table.
With this heritage, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"
Norman Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the author of "The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House".
Graham Dorrance of the Rangers is optimistic about the battle with the Vienna Rapids.
Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain with Vialreaal earlier this month, will give them plenty of chances to qualify from the 7th Group of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrance from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw with Vijarel, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a springboard to greater successes.
"It was a good moment for us because Viarell is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game thinking we could do something and came out with a point.
Maybe we could have gotten away in the end, but, on the whole, the tie was a pretty fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we were a better team in the second half.
Now, Thursday is another big European night.
If things are going well, we can take three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they brought a good result in their last game, but, with the world on the podium, I'm sure we can do our best and bring a positive result.
Last year was certainly difficult, because of my injuries and the changes that have taken place in the team itself, but there is a positive feeling now.
The team is good and the kids are enjoying it, the coaching is good.
Let us hope that we can put our best foot forward now, put last year behind us and succeed".
Women lose sleep because of their fear of retirement savings
Although the study participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few discussed this with their families.
Nearly half of the participants in Nationwide's survey said they discuss with their spouses the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had discussed the subject with their children.
"People want to be cared for by their family, but they don't take the initiative to have the conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Start with that.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you unless you express your wishes much earlier.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these choices can be a major factor in determining the cost.
Bring your financial advisor: Your financial advisor can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your long-term care financing options can include traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance at purchase price to help you cover these costs, or self-insurance with your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal disputes.
Make a health care power of attorney to appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that health care professionals will comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider making a power of attorney for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and to make sure that your bills are paid, in case you become incapacitated.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a sudden health problem and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Put these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"It's not just the money, but who are the doctors?" Martin asked.
"What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Make sure you have this plan ready".
A man was shot multiple times with an air gun in Ilfracombe.
A man was shot multiple times with an air gun as he walked home last night.
The victim, aged about 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe in Devon when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Police described the incident, which took place at about 02:30 British Summer Time, as an "accidental occurrence".
The victim didn't see the assailant.
The injuries he sustained are not life-threatening and police are appealing for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to official sources, with the death toll expected to rise.
With communications cut off, humanitarian aid forces have been unable to get information from Dongola, an area north of Palo, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
In Palo, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster struck.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami.
Dongola is a vice-kingdom that stretches for more than 300 kilometers (180 miles) of coastline in the southwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, a tier of administrative division below the county, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main mainstays of the economy of Central Sulawesi province and particularly in the coastal area of Dongola.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is more commonly found at Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongola.
A tsunami also hit western Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic Ring of Fire in the Pacific Ocean and is frequently affected by earthquakes.
Some of the largest recent earthquakes and tsunamis are the following:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, with more than half of those in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late May and early April.
Hundreds dead on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake measuring 7.6 on the Richter scale centered near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 earthquake hits one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, triggering a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A low-magnitude earthquake struck the Pindi Jaya area of Aceh, causing devastation and panic, as it brought back memories of the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was caused this time, but over 100 people were killed by collapsing buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing over 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily abandoned.
Sarah Palin's firstborn son was arrested for domestic violence.
Truck Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of a domestic violence report and resisting authority, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a woman he knew attempted to call the police to report the crimes she allegedly committed, he grabbed the phone out of her hands.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su temporary detention facility, with a $500 bond, KTUU television reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he said "certainly, innocent" when questioned, the network reports.
Palin is facing three Class A misdemeanor charges, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He's also charged with a class A misdemeanor, punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that a criminal case has been brought against Pailin.
In December of 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case has now been brought before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of a report for the criminal offense of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.
His partner claimed he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin came under fire from veterans groups in 2016 when she linked her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communications networks have been cut, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Video of the disastrous incident is circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking the rarely-enforced death penalty for the suspect in the New York terrorist attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saypof, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people - a rare punishment for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental van to carry out a bicycle rampage along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, dragging pedestrians and cyclists who were in his path on October 31.
In order to justify the death sentence, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "on purpose" and caused severe bodily harm "on purpose", according to the declaration of intent to execute filed in the Southern District Court of New York.
Both of these charges carry the death penalty, according to the warrant.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury brought Saipoff up against a 22-count indictment, which included eight counts of criminal conspiracy to commit murder, a tactic often used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of violence and vehicular destruction.
The attack required "considerable planning and premeditation", prosecutors said, describing the manner in which Saipov carried out the attack as "reprehensible, cruel and vicious".
"Saifullo Habibullayevich Saipof has caused pain, harm and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Anhelini, Nicolas Klivs, An-Lor Decant, Darendre Nick, Ariel Erlich, Ernan Ferucci, Ernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Panuko", the letter of intent states.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the Southern District of New York last prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually given a life sentence in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was handed out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 to husband and wife Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were executed after being convicted of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, appeared unrepentant in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told interrogators that he felt satisfied with his act, according to police.
Saypov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack by ISIS videos he saw on his cell phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to plant the ISIS flag in his hospital room, according to police.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 counts listed in the indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a plea of guilty to life imprisonment with no possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma caused by the events for all involved", Patton said.
Saifpo's defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says that NAITZEL FARATZ should be put in charge of the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the people's army" today during a protest rally at the Tory party conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) said politicians should "feel the pressure" from Eurosceptics, as one of Theresa May's MPs said he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that the UK "would have been out" by now if Mr Farage had been the minister in charge of Brexit.
But the challenge facing Mrs May in her attempt to reconcile her deeply divided MPs was underlined by the fact that Tory Remainers attended a separate anti-Brexit protest rally in the town.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep the Chequers compromise project in check amid attacks from Brexit supporters, Remain supporters and the EU.
The Allies insisted on pressing ahead with her attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the backlash, and to force the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and "chaos".
Mr Bone said at the Leave Means Leave protest rally in Solihull that he wanted to scrap "the Chequers plan".
He said that Mr Farage should have been knighted and given powers to negotiate with Brussels.
"If we were in charge, we would have left by now", he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I will support Brexit but we must throw out the Chequers plan".
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought world wars to become serfs.
We want to make our own laws in our country".
Mr Bone rejected claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The speculation that the British people have changed their mind and want to remain is completely untrue".
Tory Brexit MP Andrea Jenkins was also at the rally and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan does not have the approval of the general public, the Opposition is not going to vote for it, it does not have the approval of our party and our activists who go down the streets and at the bottom elect us.
Please stop with the Checkers project and start listening".
The Commission's proposal to introduce a new system of 'credit insurance' for the provision of services to consumers is a welcome one.
Mr Farage told the protest rally that politicians must be forced to "feel the pressure" if they are prepared to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now there is a question of trust between us - the people - and our political class", he said.
"They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them 'we will not let you get away with this.'
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make the class of our politicians, who are preparing to betray Brexit, feel the pressure.
"We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that gave us victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we are an independent, sovereign and proud United Kingdom".
Meanwhile, pro-EU supporters demonstrated in Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Few activists were holding up Tory anti-Brexit banners after the group's rally this weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the security issues they faced with a party app at the start of the session.
"These are the same people who tell us that they can put in place the information systems and all the technology needed for the EU-Canada enrichment-type deal, for the unimpeded border, for free trade without a border in Ireland", he added.
"It is an absolute fiasco.
It is not a good Brexit", he added.
Warren is planning to seriously consider running for president .
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democratic senator spoke about her future plans during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November, facing Republican state Representative Jeff Deal, who accompanied Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
There is a lot of speculation that he might face Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event was her 36th meeting with voters using the city hall since Trump's term began.
A participant in the meeting asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time "for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government and that means a woman must be at the top".
Arrested for the fatal shooting of LSU basketball player Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, announced on Saturday the arrest of a suspect in the fatal shooting of LSU basketball player Wade Simms on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Deaton Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11pm Eastern time.
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying the man in the video.
Sims, 20, was fatally shot near the campus of Southern University early Friday.
"Wade Simms suffered a gunshot wound to the head, resulting in his death", police Chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, according to the 247sports network.
Wade intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being in possession of a gun and confessed to shooting Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and is being held at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
The 6-foot-3-inch, Baton Rouge-raised junior Sims played in 32 games, including 10 starts, last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
The Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is on the road to a world title as the team's instructions hand him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas passed Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team's orders would play a major role in the race.
On the start Bottas had a good start and almost hung Hamilton, as he defended his position in the first two turns and called Fettel to attack his team.
Fettel went to the pits first and let Hamilton run in the tail end of the race, which should be decisive.
Mercedes went to the pits one lap later and came out behind Fettel, but Hamilton came out ahead after a wheel-to-wheel battle, which forced the Ferrari driver to reluctantly abandon the interior due to the risk of falling into the double-traffic violation to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from last place and was seventh at the end of the first round on the eve of his 21st birthday.
He then remained in the lead for a large part of the race, as he held on to his tyres aiming to finish fast and pass Kimi Räikkönen in fourth place.
He finally made it to the pits on lap 44, but was unable to pick up speed for the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen finished fourth.
It's a hard day because Valtteri's been fantastic all weekend and he's been a real gentleman to let me pass.
The team did great and did a couple of things", Hamilton said.
The body language was very bad.
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for insisting that she not leak a letter from Christine Blaze Ford, in which she accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, commenting instead that the proceedings in the Senate proved that people are "malicious and mean and lying".
"The only thing that could happen and this beautiful thing that's happening in the last few days in the Senate, where you see the anger, you see people who are angry and mean and mean-spirited and lying", he said.
"When you see posts and leaks and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do that".
You remember ?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak the story?
Remember her response -- you leaked the document -- "Oh, what?
Oh, no, I was just...
I didn't leak it".
Well, just a minute.
If we leaked... No, we didn't leak", he added, mimicking the senator.
Feinstein received Ford's letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh in July and it leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak was from her office.
"I did not cover up Dr. Ford's accusations, I did not leak her story", Feinstein told the committee, as reported in the Hill newspaper.
"He asked me to keep it a secret, and I kept it a secret like he asked me to".
But her refusal did not seem to convince the president, who commented during the Sabbath meeting: "I'll tell you what, the body language was very bad.
He may not have done it, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen".
In continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee who was accused of sexual harassment by three women, the president implied that the Democrats are using the accusations to serve their own ends.
"They are determined to take back power by any means necessary.
You see the malice, the misery, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to trample to take power and control", the president said, according to the Mediaite news website.

Patrick Dwyer scored two for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars have made amends for losing Friday's Elite League game to the Belfast Giants, winning the rematch 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took an easy lead with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bowyer.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney brought the game to a tie for home plate before Dwyer re-established the Giants' lead.
François Bouchard equalised for the Dantes and then two goals from Lucas Ludwald Nielsen secured the team's victory.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League this season for Adam Keefe's men, who were coming off a 2-1 win over Dundee in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants having won the previous three games.
Dwyer opened the scoring in the fourth minute at 3:35 with an assist from Kendall McFall, while David Rutherford provided the assist that helped Bowyer double the lead four minutes later.
In a game-tying opening period, Sullivan put the home team back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt gave the go-ahead for a tie from Kauney at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the lead for the Giants in the first half when he scored his second goal of the night late in the first quarter.
The home team regrouped and Bussard tied again with a power-play goal at 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game towards the end of the second period and he secured the victory with his team's fifth goal in the last half-hour.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller loses his life to save hundreds of passengers in an earthquake plane
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero, having lost his life in an attempt to secure the safe takeoff of a plane carrying hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people were killed and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Powerful earthquakes continue to hit the area and many are trapped in rubble in the city of Palu.
But even as his colleagues ran for their lives, 21-year-old Antony Gunawan Agung refused to give up his position in the frantically shaking control tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palo.
He stayed in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Johannes Siret said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, as reported by Australian television network ABC News.
We arranged for a helicopter to take him from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"We are shocked by his death", she added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could be in the thousands, with the country's disaster management agency reporting that access to the cities of Donggala, Shigi and Butong is limited.
"The death toll is expected to rise further as many bodies are still under the rubble, while many of them have not been reached", said the agency's spokesman, Suto Poorguo Nugroho.
Waves as high as six meters have destroyed the Pallu, which will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing in aid and supplies.
Risa Kuzama, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance is bringing in bodies.
There's a shortage of clean water.
The mini-markets are being looted everywhere".
Jean Gelfand, president of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to save survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
What happened is a tragedy, but it could be much worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I am asking you to work day and night to carry out any work related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Indonesia was struck earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
Air crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a man is missing after plane crashes into a lake
The airline that operated a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia is now reporting that one man is missing, while earlier saying that all 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini in a press release said that as of Saturday afternoon they are unable to find the trail of a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to locate the man.
The air carrier did not immediately respond to requests for further information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water as it tried to land at the Chuk Island airport.
Authorities said Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The causes of the conflict and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane went aground in the lagoon off the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had overtaken the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came down too low.
"This is extremely good", said Jens.
Jans said that he and others managed to make their way through the water to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicked and screaming and he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors working nearby to improve a dock also assisted in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people to shore before the ship sank to a depth of about 100 feet (30 m).
According to figures from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in Papua New Guinea-registered airline collisions over the past two decades, but none of these conflicts involved Air Niugini.
Analyst cites the timeline of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecuting attorney completed her deposition Saturday at the retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to put the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tallis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers in order on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location files from several cell phones that showed that Telis was with Chambers the night of her death, contradicting his previous claims, the Clarion Ledger newspaper reported.
When the data showed that his phone was with Chambers' phone during the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified as a witness on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecution asked him if Tallis was telling the truth about being in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville".
Another contradiction was that Tallis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Cell records show that they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers died, Tallis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life", Hale said.
The defense is set to begin its trial on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial later that day to be adjourned to the jury.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by infusing positive messages into their music.
High Breed, from Bristol, claim that hip hop has moved away from its roots, which were political messages and tackling social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as Fugees and Common are experiencing a recent resurgence in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?
Nanny in New York suing couple who fired her after receiving "racist" text
A nanny in New York City is suing a couple for racial discrimination after receiving a text message that was accidentally sent to her by her mother complaining that the nanny was "another black person".
The couple denies being racist, likening the lawsuit to "blackmail".
Lynsey Plazko-Flaxman, a mother of two, was disappointed when she realized that new nanny Giselle Morris was black, as soon as the latter showed up for her first day on the job in 2016.
"OTHER WORKS", wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, and twice.
Once she realized her blunder, the now-embarrassed Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Morris, stating that their outgoing nanny, who was African-American, had not done a good job and was waiting for a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Morris was paid for her one and only day of work and then sent home in an Uber.
Now, Mrs. Morris has brought suit against the couple for severance pay and claims compensation of $350 a day for the six-month work as an in-house nanny, for which she was originally hired, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them that, look, you can't do things like that", he told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple countered the claims that they are racist, saying that it was reasonable to fire Morris, as they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her again after having offended her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to send.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists", husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you had offended, even accidentally?
Your newborn baby?
Come on now".
Likening the lawsuit to "rape", Plasco said that his wife had given birth just two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Would you go after someone in this condition?
It's not that kind", the investment banker added.
While the legal case is ongoing, the court of public opinion has rushed to condemn the couple on social media, condemning them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington's publishers feared readers would not care about a talking teddy bear, as a new letter reveals
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the position of someone who read it for the first time before its publication.
It's a lot of fun when you know what we now know about Paddington's huge success".
She said her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book by a teddy bear, was optimistic about his work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "bittersweet" as her father passed away last year.
Of Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of the family", she added that her father was secretly proud of his subsequent success.
"He was a rather quiet man and not arrogant", she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who accomplished something: you're proud of it even if it's not really your accomplishment.
I think that's kind of how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his own creation and of his own imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself".
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad kept calling and telling me that it was very bad, that he didn't have much of a chance of making it", Mrs. Ednan-Lapperoux said.
"At one point Ned called to tell me that he was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say good-bye.
And I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication that the doctors had given her to keep her heart alive was slowly being depleted and being released from her system.
He was already dead a few hours ago, and that time and now it's all gone.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that this was all happening.
I couldn't scream, yell or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to stay calm".
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Lapérouse, who until now has been mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who were unaware of her ordeal.
"Nobody knew", he said.
"I had my head down and tears were running all the time.
It's hard to explain, but when I was on the plane, I was overcome with a sense of compassion for Nadd.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her".
Women mourning the loss of their own faces hang cards on bridges to prevent suicides
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are trying to prevent other people from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys hang cards on a Welsh bridge with encouraging messages and phone numbers to call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day", he said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said his smile lit up the room".
However, he left his job before he died, as he was "in a very bad condition".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, was the one who found his brother after he had taken his own life.
Mrs Davis said: "I am quite concerned that there will be repercussions".
Mrs. Davis created the cards "to let people know that there are people out there that you can go and talk to, even if they're your friends.
Do not remain silent - you must speak".
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davis for many years, lost her partner of 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he was feeling down or sad or anything like that", he said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behaviour.
He had hit rock bottom on Christmas Day - when the children opened their presents, he didn't look them in the eye".
He said that his death has caused them a huge trauma, but they have to overcome it: "It breaks up the family.
It's crushing us. It's not like that.
But we all have to keep going and fighting".

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in doubt as the FBI begins an investigation
"I thought that if we could actually achieve something like what he was asking for - a limited inquiry of limited duration and subject matter - maybe we could bring some unity", Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would dissolve amid entrenched partisan deadlocks.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is entirely due to timing.
The midterm election is in just five weeks, on November 6th, and if, as expected, the Republicans don't do well, they will be significantly weakened in their effort to get the person they want elected to the nation's highest court.
George Walker Bush calls Senators, pressing them to support Mr. Kavanaugh who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI report is presented?
A vote will be taken in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear whether Mr. Cavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to get a majority and confirm his nomination to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors falls under Kim's rule
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, according to a lawmaker from South Korea.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea's unification ministry, said there were 1,127 defections last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher charges for smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has the largest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross compared to the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea.
China considers dissidents illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forcibly expels them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still formally at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the stalled denuclearization negotiations.
This meeting came after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they agreed on broad terms to cooperate on denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Rim Jong-il blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under these circumstances, under no circumstances will we disarm our country unilaterally first", Mr. Reem said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House of Representatives Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was inherently unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman behaved in this way, they would call her 'hysterical'", Pelosi commented regarding Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh, with great emotion, denied the accusations that he had committed sexual assault against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was deeply moved, sometimes almost shouting and his voice trembling as he spoke of his family and his school years.
He also bluntly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him "a vicious and coordinated political assassination of character" orchestrated by liberals angered by Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proved he can't serve on the Supreme Court, as it showed he's biased against Democrats.
"I think he's shut himself out with these statements and the way he's managed to go against the Clintons and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi reacted when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if his appointment is confirmed and if the Democrats gain a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not fit to not only the Supreme Court, but the court he's currently serving on", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions on the Affordable Care Act or in the case of Roy v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
At the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh refrained from answering questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"Isn't it time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't this wonderful?' " said Pelosi.
And women should have it in their possession.
It's a justified outburst, months and years of rage are pouring out and she can't get it out of her without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't find that unusual, do you?"
She went on to say: "I was helped a lot by a woman who was a manager somewhere, who said that she also cried when she got angry, but she had developed a technique whereby when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, 'You might think I'm upset because I'm crying.
I'm mad at you".
So he just kept going.
And I thought it was great".
Tears are allowed as an outburst of anger in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my fondest memories of a job I once had in a male-dominated office is of crying in unspoken rage, and being grabbed by the neck by an older woman - a cold executive whom I had always been afraid of - and dragged to a ladder.
"Never let them see you cry", he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're upset, and they'll be happy to break your neck".
Patricia Schrender, then a Democratic senator from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his campaign for president.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having an affair on a boat called Monkey Business and left the race in humiliation, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, thought there was no reason not to consider the idea of running for president herself.
"It was not such a wise decision", he told me laughingly, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another nomination.
Someone described the situation as "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because the campaign had already started long ago, he was behind in funding and so he vowed he wouldn't enter the race until he had raised $2 million.
The battle was lost.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
"Do they think I'm on a discount?" he wondered.
In her speech announcing that she would not be launching a formal campaign, she was so intensely charged with emotions - gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters instead of representatives and anger at sexism - that it felt like a noose around her neck.
"You'd think I was having a nervous breakdown", Mrs. Schroeder recalls of the press's reaction to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will they write on my tombstone?
"She cried"?
How the US-China trade war can do Beijing good
The cheering thunders of the trade war between the US and China have been deafening and while the battle has a long way to go, a rift between the two countries may be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year, taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation came this week, with new tariffs on $200 million worth of goods, effectively taxing half of all goods imported into the US from China.
Beijing returns the fireworks in kind every time, and it recently imposed tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 million worth of goods.
China is determined to retaliate against American missiles and the world's second largest economy is not likely to give up anytime soon.
In order to succeed in getting Washington to back down he would have to give in to their demands, but publicly bowing to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
But experts say that if Beijing can play its cards right, US pressure in the trade war could be positive for China in the long run by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a hasty policy decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic collapse in either country is actually far more dangerous than observers have admitted in the past", said Abigail Grace, a research associate with an Asia-focused study at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria is 'ready' for the return of refugees, according to Foreign Minister
Syria claims it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help to rebuild the country devastated by seven years (and more) of war.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem said that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All the conditions are now met for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war broke out in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al Mualem said that help to rebuild the destroyed country is welcome from the Syrian government.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe seals the victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the US team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris in France.
The American team has now lost six straight times on European soil and hasn't won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe once again took the lead, as Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
Team USA star Phil Mickelston, who had been fighting hard for most of the tournament, threw his shot into the water on the par-3 16th hole, handing the victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has been on the winning side in all four rounds, making him one of only four players to go 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spith was defeated at 5 and 4 by the lowest ranked player of the European team, the Dane Thorbjorn Olsen.
The world's highest-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, went 2-1 against England's Ian Pulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup game.
Eight-time Ryder Cup veteran Spaniard Sergio Garcia was crowned the tournament's all-time winningest European with a total of 25.5 points.
"I don't normally cry, but today I can't help myself.
It's been a rough year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very, very happy we got the cup back.
It's all for the team and I'm glad I could help", said Garcia after the European victory.
He gives the boot to his compatriot John Ramm, who beat American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in a singles match on Sunday.
"I feel incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, I grew up admiring this guy", said Ram, 23.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a career Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
Unusual statistics for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles and is only surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find a goal, with the exception of Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Fino, who played top-level golf throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Farrick spoke after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought it out.
At some point this morning we put a lot of pressure on Europe.
We fought hard.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great leader.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup, work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup Committee, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to face it.
They were better than us".
