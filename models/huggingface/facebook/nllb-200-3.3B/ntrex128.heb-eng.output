The members of the Welsh parliament are afraid of being seen as a bunch of clogs.
Some MPs were alarmed by the suggestion that their title should be changed from AMs to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This concern arose following plans to change the name of the legislature to the Welsh Parliament.
MPs across the political spectrum are worried that this will invite ridicule.
One Labour MP said his people feared it would clash with the Twp and the Pwp.
For readers outside of Wales: in Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means poopy.
A member of parliament from the Labour Party, Floyd Cameron, said all his colleagues were "displeased" and offered alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his colleagues were open to suggestions about changing the name, but noted that the name MWP (the initials of the Welsh Member of Parliament) sounded very similar to the word Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the pronunciation of the English u in the Yorkshire accent.
The House committee, which is currently drafting the name-change legislation, said: "The final decision regarding any descriptive words regarding the job titles of members of the House is of course the decision of the members of the House themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of the public consultation on the proposals, in which broad support was given to change the name of the House of Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the MPs (AMs), the committee recommended the Welsh MPs or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most support in the public consultation.
MPs are offering alternatives, but the struggle to reach consensus could cause quite a headache for the committee chair, Ellen Jones, who is due to submit a draft of the changes in the coming weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the way the House of Commons works, including rules for the removal of MPs and the structure of the committee system.
It is the votes of MPs that will ultimately determine their titles during the debates of legislation.
Macedonian citizens go to the polls in a referendum to change the name of the country
Citizens will vote on Sunday on the question of whether to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was decided in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, in which a province called Macedonia exists.
Greece has long claimed that its neighbor to the north is a claim on Greek territory and has opposed Macedonia's attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who opposed the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the results.
However, those who support the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zeev, argue that the name change is simply the price to pay to join the European Union and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church are silent in the face of the difficulties of the churches in the Harlem neighborhood.
According to Mr. Adams, the oldest residents of the neighborhood say that there used to be a bar and a church on every corner.
"Today there are no temples or churches".
He said it was understandable that the Bears disappeared.
People's social lives today are different, note.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood living room where people visit on a regular basis".
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not survive as long as the church leaders expect, and sooner or later they will find themselves back at the starting point".
He said that churches would be replaced by apartment buildings with communal houses that would house people who were not the kind of people who would help the neighborhoods maintain their distinctive character.
"The vast majority of people buying apartments in these buildings will be white people", he says, "which will make it harder for these churches to close, because it's unlikely that most of the people who move into these apartments will join these churches".
Both churches were built by white believers before Harlem became a predominantly black neighborhood - Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, and St. Martin's ten years later.
The white Methodist community left in the 1930's.
A black community of believers who operated in the area became the owners of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community of believers under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a strike against merchants on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who refused to employ or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 caused heavy damage to the building, but as part of the believers' plans under Reverend Johnson to rebuild it, they commissioned the construction of the Crypt of the Bells.
The Rev. David Johnson, son of Johnson Sr. and heir to his position at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the poor man's bell".
The expert who defended the crayon in July called it something else: "a cultural treasure and an irreplaceable historical object".
The expert, Tiffany Ing of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first bell carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dioncio A. Lind, who went on to play the larger bell in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Marriott said St. Martin's Church didn't replace him.
What happened at St. Martin's over the last few months was a complicated story of architects and builders, some brought in by the local church leaders, and others by the Episcopal bishops.
The assembly - the governing body of the community of believers made up of local believers - wrote to the bishops in July a letter expressing its concerns that the bishops were trying to roll the costs to the assembly, even though the assembly was not involved in hiring the architects and receivers the bishops had sent.
Some of the faithful have complained of the lack of transparency on the part of the bishops.
A shark wounds a 13-year-old boy diving for lobsters
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday as the boy dived to catch lobsters in California on the first day of lobster season, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 a.m. near the Bacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help and then went there with a team to help rescue him to shore.
At first, Hamel thought it was just enthusiastic shouts about catching a lobster, but then he realized the boy was shouting "Bite me!"
I got bitten!
Hamel said that when he approached the boy he saw that all of his shin bone was torn.
"I yelled out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hamel.
The boy was rushed to the Radi Hospital in San Diego where he is listed as a quadriplegic.
It's unknown what kind of shark attacked the boy.
Rescue commander Larry Giles said in a press briefing that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined to be a non-hazardous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to his upper body.
Authorities have closed access to the beach between Ponto Beach in Casillas and Suami Beach in Bacinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered to be endangered.
Sainsbury's is planning to enter the beauty market in the UK.
Sainsbury's starts in competition with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and develops a department store-style conversions with professional saleswomen.
As part of a significant initiative to tap into the £2.8 billion-a-year beauty market in the UK, which continues to grow as fashion and home sales decline, the expanded beauty aisles will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, will be added to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty products comes at a time when grocers are looking for ways to use shelf space previously captured by TVs, microwave ovens and household products.
Sainsbury's reported that the company expects to double its beauty product offering to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time in its history.
Existing product lines of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be expanded with dedicated branded areas similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The department store chain is also re-launching its makeup line - Boutique - so that most products will be eco-friendly, a feature that is in demand among younger shoppers.
In addition, the fragrance shop chain will be testing franchises at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week and the second will open in Slea Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the over-the-top purchase of small amounts of food every day at local convenience stores are forcing grocers to do more to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Cope, Sainsbury's CEO, said that the branches would become more like his dog stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight against the cheaper Aldi and Lidl chains with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has added Argos outlets in hundreds of stores as well as several Habitat outlets since acquiring the two chains two years ago, additions that it says have raised grocery sales and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The chain's previous attempts to revive its beauty and pharmacy departments had ended in failure.
Sainsbury's attempted a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after a dispute over how to share the profits from the pharmacies within the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-branch pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds pharmacy chain for £125 million three years ago.
Lloyds will play a role in the scheme, she said, by expanding the range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Sainsbury's commercial director Paul Mills-Hicks said: "We've transformed the look and feel of our beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invested in highly skilled employees who would be available to provide counseling on the spot.
Our branded offerings are designed to suit every need and our attractive surroundings and convenient locations make us an attractive destination for beauty shopping, in a way that challenges the old ways of shopping".
Peter Jones was furious after Holly Willoughby cancelled an £11 million deal with the British firm.
The star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones, has expressed anger after the television presenter Holly Willoughby cancelled an £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Actually, Willaby doesn't have time for their own brand of home accessories.
The two's joint venture is considered similar to actress Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host announced her departure in an Instagram post.
Holly Willaby has left Dragons Den star Peter Jones in a foul mood by cancelling her last-minute participation in the duo's luxury lifestyle brand to focus on her fat contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones reacted with "flammation" when the TV star announced during a stormy meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that following her new deals - worth up to £1.5 - she had not enough time left to devote to their Truly homewear and accessories brand.
The two's joint venture was considered similar to actress Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was expected to double Willaby's fortune, estimated at £11 million.
When 37-year-old Willabee posted on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones was on a flight from the UK to one of his vacation homes.
According to one source, "Truly was clearly Hooli's top priority.
It was supposed to be her long-term future that would provide her with income for decades to come.
The decision to leave completely surprised everyone involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to launch.
The company's warehouses in Marlow are full of products ready for sale".
Experts believe that the departure of the host of This Morning, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions as a result of huge investments in products ranging from mattresses and candles to homewares, and potentially further delay the launch.
And that could bring an end to long-standing friendships.
Willaby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin had been close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Kapp, for ten years.
Willaby founded Truly with Kapp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple had been on vacation together and Jones owns 40% of the Baldwin Television Productions company.
Willoughby will become an M&S brand ambassador and will replace Annette McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We do not comment on his business dealings".
Tough talk. Then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism he gets from the news media for statements that some call "unpresidential" and that he is so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump made so many concessions?
"Trump said in the voice of a newscaster".
"I did not make any concessions".
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after praising their first meeting in June as a major step toward North Korea's denuclearization.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong-ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea sees no response from the United States to North Korea's initial disarmament steps.
Instead, he says, the U.S. is continuing sanctions designed to keep the pressure on.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his speech at the rally.
"We're in great shape with North Korea", he said.
"We almost went to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship".
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had produced positive results - halting missile tests, assisting in the release of prisoners and returning the remains of American soldiers home.
And he defended his unconventional approach to his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into that packed stadium, we had about 200 people standing there", Trump said as he pointed straight at him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island and killed hundreds of people
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok has lost their homes, it has not been declared a national disaster, which is a condition for international aid.
In many cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it is a bit of a challenge, Ms. Sumbong said.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team to travel to Palo, it is not yet clear whether foreign delegates will be allowed to pass through the area.
Mr. Soto, spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palau to see if more international services can contribute to the relief effort.
With earthquakes occurring all the time in Indonesia, the country remains woefully unprepared for natural disasters.
While tsunami buoys have been built in Oche County, they are rare in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning alarms in Palo, despite the warning, likely contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best of times, traveling between the many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make the logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship docked in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is making its way to Palo, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster area.
Improving Indonesia's poor infrastructure was at the center of President Joko Widodo's election campaign, and he invested heavily in roads and railways.
But Mr. Goku is facing funding shortfalls in his re-election bid next year.
Mr. Goku also faces pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia as a result of the religious extremism of the country's Muslim majority.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced in street clashes between Christian and Muslim gangs - using knives, bows and arrows and other home-made weapons.
Daniel Stridge of Liverpool equals at the last minute against Chelsea.
Daniel Stridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League with an 89th-minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Stridgett got a pass from Mirhan Shakiry, who was 30 yards from Chelsea's goal and his team trailing 1-0.
He bounces the ball to his left and then rotates the kick across the far-field.
The ball flew high over the court and landed toward the top right corner of the net.
Eventually the ball landed over the goalkeeper of the Capa Arrizabalaga who was leaping towards him, and fell into the net.
I was just trying to get to this position, get to the ball and players like Shaq always play as far forward as possible, so I was just trying to create as much time as possible for myself", Sredegar told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kanta and I made one touch and I didn't think about it too much and I just kicked".
Chelsea led 0-1 at half-time after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The blue forward passed a return pass to Matteo Kovacic in that game, before turning close to the midfield and rushing into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic made a quick let-and-go in the middle of the pitch.
Then he kicked a beautiful cross, which led the ace into the space.
Hazzard rushed the defense and finished with the ball inside the top right corner of the goal, with a left-handed kick that passed Liverpool's Allison Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League home leg on Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Vidotson in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3pm in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency announced Sunday morning.
Many people were reported trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed in Friday's 7.5-magnitude earthquake, which caused waves as high as 20 feet (6 meters), agency spokesman Soto Forvo Naruhō said at a news conference.
The city of Palo, with more than 380,000 residents, was covered in rubble from collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
Police have opened a murder investigation after the body of a woman was found this morning in Beckenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55am on the street of Geron when the body was stabbed, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking anyone in the area who has seen or heard anything to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said the investigation is in its early stages, but I would urge anyone who has been in the vicinity of Gunn Street in Birkenhead and seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have filmed something on a car camera, to contact us - because the footage may also contain information that is vital to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and that she was found inside a building.
Friends who thought they knew the woman came to the scene this afternoon to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The inquiries continue as police have announced that they are now in the process of notifying the relatives.
A cab driver living in Grayson Mews just tried to enter his apartment, but was told that the police are barring anyone from entering or leaving the building.
He was shocked when he found out what happened.
Residents are now being told they'll be gone for hours before they can return to their apartments.
A policeman is heard telling one man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman was seen in the arena when she was lying down.
She comes back and says, "That's terrible".
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were seen inside the arena and another outside.
A couple of cops were standing inside the arena pointing people at the apartment building.
Anyone with information is asked to tweet directly to @MerPolCC, dial 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 and state the journal number 247 dated 30 September.
Cromwell's Parliament statue became the next target for attacks on memorials in the struggle over the writing of history
The removal of the statue would be poetic justice in light of the puritan supporters' dismantling of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts.
But the Cromwell Foundation says that Mr. Crick's proposal is "foolish" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Foundation, said: "It was inevitable that in the current controversy over the removal of statues, the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Palace would become the target.
The sculptural decay of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered by Cromwell nor carried out by him.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell fell victim to the actions of one of his predecessors in the dynasty - Thomas Cromwell - in the previous century.
The impressive representation of Cromwell by the sculptor Sir William Hammam Thornycroft is a testament to the 19th-century view and part of the historiography of a figure many still consider worthy of respect.
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was seen by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as protecting Parliament against outside pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate estimate is a matter of continuing historical controversy.
It is an indisputable fact that the struggle in the mid-17th century shaped the development of our nation later on, and Cromwell is one recognizable figure representing one side of the spectrum at that time.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of honor and celebration".
A deadly pig that drove a Chinese farmer to his death.
Local media sources report that a pig attacked a farmer to death in a market in southwest China.
The man, identified by his family name as Zhiyuan, was found dead with a broken artery covered in blood near the pig farm in the market of Lopenshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A farmer prepares to vaccinate a pig at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly left Wednesday with a cousin from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next day, his cousin found him dead, and discovered a door to a nearby pig farm open.
He said a large male pig was found in the yard with blood on its mouth.
A criminal investigation has confirmed that a 250-pound pig attacked the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My uncle's feet were full of blood and bruises", said the cousin, whose family name is W, as quoted in the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market Thursday morning at 4:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man didn't belong to Ivan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked behind a fence and a fence to prevent it from attacking more people, as police gather evidence at the scene.
It is reported that negotiations are underway between Yuan's family and the market authorities regarding compensation for his death.
Although rare, there have been reports of pigs attacking humans in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and a man on their farm in Massachusetts, causing the man fatal injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig had tied a Welsh farmer to his tractor until the farmer's wife ran the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Minnesota farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive but the taste of blood can be a trigger.
They're just playing.
They're like naughty kids, very nosy... They don't mean you any harm.
Just give them the respect they deserve, he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rains in large areas of the southwestern United States.
As forecast, Hurricane Rosa weakened as it moved over the cooler waters of the northern Gulf of Mexico.
However, Hurricane Rosa will bring flooding rains throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
The winds in Tropical Storm Rosa reached 135 km/h, which is a Category 1 hurricane, and it is expected to make landfall on Sunday at 5am Eastern Time, with the center of the storm located 620 km southeast of Punta Yoguina, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, an updraft is forming over the Pacific Ocean moving eastward toward the east coast of the U.S. As Rosa approaches the peninsula in California on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push deep tropical moisture north into the American Southwest.
Rosa will bring up to 250 millimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
After that, tropical humidity combined with the approaching trough will create heavy rain over large areas of the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Locally, 25 to 100 millimeters of rain will cause flash floods and threaten land-slip in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will cause rainfall amounts to reach 50 to 75 millimeters per hour at various points, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall amounts of 50 to 100 mm are expected in parts of the southwestern United States, particularly in Arizona.
There may be flash floods with conditions rapidly deteriorating due to the diffuse nature of the tropical rain.
It is highly recommended that you avoid long-distance hiking in the desert when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rainfall could turn canyons into noisy rivers and thunderstorms bring strong winds and dust storms.
The approaching apogee will bring local rains to parts of the Southern California coastline.
There could be cumulative rainfall of over 13 mm, which could cause a garbage dump and smooth roads.
It will be the first rain in the region this rainy season.
Scattered tropical rain showers will begin approaching Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, and the rain will intensify and spread over the following Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the four corners on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
October can see sharp temperature changes across the United States, with the Arctic cooling but the tropics remaining quite warm.
This sometimes leads to dramatic changes in temperature between short distances.
Sunday is a prime example of extreme temperature changes across the central United States.
There's a temperature difference of almost 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis to Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, a prolonged case of Katy fever will attempt to develop and expand again.
By early October, temperatures will be warm across much of the central and eastern United States, ranging from 27 to 31 degrees from the southern plains to the northeast.
In New York City, the temperature is expected to reach 90 degrees on Tuesday, which is about five degrees above average.
Long-term weather forecasts show high probabilities of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the Burt Kavanaugh hearing
Over 20 million people watched Thursday on six networks the fascinating testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of an alleged sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political debate continues, with news flashes amid the regular broadcasts to announce a surprising development on Friday: an agreement brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI will conduct a week-long investigation to verify the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she's 100% certain that Quano was drunk and touched her body and tried to undress her during a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a deposition, said he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
It was probably even higher than the 20.4 million Nielsen ratings.
Nielsen analyzed the average viewership of the networks CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The data was not immediately available to other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has a hard time measuring people watching in offices.
For comparison, this is a viewing audience on a scale similar to that of a football playoff or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen data, Fox News Channel, whose viewers are enthusiastic supporters of Kavanaugh's nomination, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long hearing.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to the Nielsen report.
Interest levels remained high after the hearing.
Senator Flake was the central figure in the drama that unfolded on Friday.
After the moderate Republican senator's office issued a notice that he would vote for Kavanaugh's nomination, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameramen as a group of protesters shouted at him while trying to get into an elevator to get to a Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood there looking humiliated for a few minutes as the protesters chased him away, as it was being filmed live on CNN.
"I stand here before you", said one of the women.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the nation?
"You have power, " he was told, "but so many women are powerless".
Flake said his office had put out a statement saying that before the elevator door was closed, he would say more at the committee hearing.
All the networks and cable networks went live just hours later, as the Judiciary Committee was about to vote on Kavanaugh's nomination for the Senate.
But Flake said he would vote for the nomination only if there was an understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the candidate within the next week, which the Democratic minority members had demanded.
Flake is convinced in part by conversations he's had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and a few senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had force, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have a majority to confirm Quano's nomination without an investigation.
President Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
The British Prime Minister, Theresa May, has accused her critics of "playing politics" on Brexit.
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and damaging the national internet, in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview that appeared alongside the idea on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson went on to attack her Brexit "play-off" plan, saying that the proposal for Britain and the EU to cancel each other's tariffs was "completely untrue".
Police have arrested Deaton Simpson as a suspect in the murder of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Simms, a 20-year-old basketball player who played for LSU.
A 20-year-old man named Deaton Simpson has been arrested and booked for first-degree murder, Baton Rouge Police say.
Officials released video of the altercation between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said Simpson's DNA was on them, according to a report by WAFB, which is part of the CBS network.
After questioning Simpson, police say he confessed to shooting Wade to death.
Bail was set at $350,000, as reported in the Advocate.
The pathology department of East Baton Rouge released a preliminary report Friday, stating the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
Police gave credit to the Louisiana State Police's fugitive capture task force, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and local citizens who helped in the investigation that led to the capture of the suspect.
LSU athletics director Guo Wela, thanked local law enforcement for "the diligence and persecution of justice".
Sims was 20.
The 6'2" forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, played basketball at LSU.
Last season he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked and appalled" by Wade's death.
"That's what they're afraid of all the time", Wade said.
The volcano spews ash over Mexico City
Ash from the eruption of the Popocatépetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned residents of Mexico on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center of Notro is experiencing tremors and tremors.
Photos on social media showed minute layers of ash covering the windows of cars in Mexico City neighborhoods, such as Sochimilco.
Geophysicists have been noticing increased activity at the volcano, located 72 km (45 miles) southeast of the capital, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goi, has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists as the anniversary of the independence vote approaches
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police forces to break up the demonstrations, and thousands more joined the protests against the first anniversary of the party's vote for Catalan independence.
A group of masked separatists stopped by police for dispersing the demonstrations threw eggs at the police and sprayed paint, creating black dust clouds in the streets normally crowded with tourists.
Clashes also broke out later that day when police had to use batons to overpower the protesters.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanting "Unforgettable, unforgivable" stood up to pro-unity supporters chanting "Long live Spain".
Local media reported that 14 people were treated for minor injuries sustained by the protesters.
Tensions remain high in pro-independence areas a year after the October 1 referendum was deemed illegal by the Spanish government, but celebrated by pro-independence Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly chose to become an independent state, although the turnout was low as those opposed to secession overwhelmingly boycotted the vote.
Government officials in Catalonia reported that nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent the holding of ballots in violent clashes across the region.
Pro-independence groups set up a camp for the night on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the National Police.
The demonstration took place but had to be held in a different way.
Narcisse Thermes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in the separatist demonstration with his wife, said he had lost hope for Catalonia's chance of independence.
Last year we had our best moments.
I've seen my parents cry with joy that they can vote, but now we're stuck, he said.
Although Catalan separatist parties won a significant, if delayed, victory in last December's elections, they have struggled to maintain momentum this year as many of their best-known leaders are living in voluntary exile or in prison awaiting trial for their part in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Juan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the police demonstration on his phone, said the conflict was being fueled by politicians on both sides of the aisle.
"It's getting worse", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in prison awaiting trial since late last year, announced that he will run in next year's European Parliament elections.
He said that standing as a candidate for the European elections was the best way to stamp out the regression of democratic values and the repression that we have seen from the Spanish government.
Several men were arrested after a car crashed into a house.
Three men - aged 33, 34 and 39 - were arrested after a car crashed into a house in Londonderry several times.
The incident took place in the Blenagar Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 BST.
Detective Bob Lemings said that damage was done to the gates and to the building itself.
It's also possible that at some point, Nora fired a crossbow arrow at the car.
Menga's kick gives Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Mango's first goal for Livingston ensured the win.
Livingston, who had just been promoted to the Premier League, stunned Rangers and manager Steven Gerrard with only his second defeat in 18 games as manager of Ivorrocks.
Dolly Mangu's kick was significant because Gary Holt's team moved up a level with Hibernia in second place.
Gerrard's team remain unbeaten away from home in the Premier League this season, and will face leading Hertz, who are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston extends their losing streak to six games, and head coach Holt has yet to take a break since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed opportunities against a weak host team.
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before they scored, when their consistency caused the Rangers various problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his attempts before the goal, and then Alan Leathgway could focus his efforts only wide after slipping in to meet Craig Helgett's forward before the goal.
The hosts were willing to let Ranger play in front of them, knowing they could make it hard for the home team with free kicks.
And that was how the decisive gate was opened.
The Rangers got a free kick and Livingstone made an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to block Menga, who made a touchdown and scored from the centre of the wide.
At this point, the Rangers were holding the ball but found the home-field defense to be impenetrable, and Liam Kelly's goal remained virtually unchallenged.
That pattern continued into the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos did force Kelly to save the goal.
Scott Pittnam has blocked the legs of Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor and Lithgow has touched a wide ball from another free kick by Livingston.
Cross balls continued to enter and interfere with Livingston's passing, while two penalty balls - for a tackle offence on substitute Glenn Middleton, and one for a hand reach - were removed.
♪ I'm so excited ♪ ♪ I'm so excited ♪
Alistair Lamont, BBC Scotland at the Tony Macrone Stadium
Amazing game and amazing result from Livingston.
All the players have been excellent, and they've continued to exceed expectations in this upward swing.
Their style of play and lineup has barely changed since their return to the lead, but much credit must be given to Holt for the way he has shaped the team since his arrival.
He had so many stars.
Captain Holcett was formidable, leading a wonderfully organized defense, while Mage kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrell on high alert all the way.
But the Rangers were uninspired.
Although they were sometimes quite good under Guerrer, they did not meet those standards.
They were missing the final ball - only once they opened up the home team's defense - and that's a red light for the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the field.
A mixed reception for Ardoun at the Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday.
It's the final day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at patching up relations between the two NATO member states.
They were divided on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's membership in the European Union.
From there, Erdoğan went on to attend the grand opening of a new mosque.
Cologne is the city with the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
Police announced security reasons to bar a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurdish - also took to the streets, protesting both Erdogan's policies and Germany's decision to welcome him.
The opposing protesters reflect the controversy surrounding the guest, with some Turks in Germany hailing him as a hero and others denouncing him as a tyrant.
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car.
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Stowwood and Evelyn Streets, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at approximately 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics treated the wounded, but the man died at the scene.
The collision comes after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run on Childer Street, about a mile from the crash site on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police say officers are trying to identify the victim and notify his family.
Instead of roadblocks and buses being diverted to alternative routes, drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Latham Prison: Six inmates were injured in the riot
Six guards were injured in a riot at a male-only prison, the prison office said.
The riot broke out at Long Larten Prison in West Riding on Sunday around 9:30 British time, and it's still going on.
Special forces from the Tornado Unit were brought to the scene to quell the riot, which involved eight prisoners and a blockade on one wing.
Guards were treated for minor injuries inside.
A spokesman for the Department of Corrections said that highly trained officers have been recruited to deal with an ongoing incident at Long Larten Prison.
Six prisoners were treated for injuries.
We do not accept violence in our prisons, and we are clear that those involved will be handed over to the police and their prison terms may be extended.
Long Lathrin prison houses 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison warden was treated in a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, riot police were called to the prison to deal with a serious riot in which guards were attacked with snooker sticks.
Hurricane Rosa is threatening flash flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It's rare for a tropical downpour to hit Arizona, but that's exactly what's expected to happen early next week, when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa cross the desert in the southeast and bring with them the threat of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued a flash flood warning for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona into southeastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and approach late Monday with showers.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that only ten tropical cyclones have remained a tropical storm or a tropical depression within a 200-mile radius of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the Arizona Hurricane Center predict 50 to 100 inches of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 150 inches in the Arizona Mountains.
Other areas in the southwestern desert, including the Central Rockies and the Great Basin, are expected to receive 25 to 50 millimeters, with the possibility of isolated locations receiving as little as 50 millimeters.
For those outside the flash flood zone, the rain of Hurricane Rosa may be a blessing because the area is suffering from a drought.
Although flooding is a serious threat, some of these rains will be helpful because the southwest region is currently suffering from drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, over 40 percent of Arizona is in severe drought, the second-most severe category, as reported by weather.com.
First, a path of a tropical cyclone will make landfall across the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still a hurricane on Sunday morning with maximum sustained winds of 137 km/h, is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at about 20 km/h.
The storm is encountering cooler waters in the Pacific, and so it's weakening.
It is therefore expected to make landfall in Mexico as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rains across parts of Mexico could be heavy and cause a risk of severe flooding.
Rainfall totals of 75 to 150 millimeters are expected from southern California to northwestern Sonora, with a chance of up to 250 millimeters, reports weather.com.
After that, Hurricane Rosa will continue into Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, then continuing across Arizona into southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The primary danger from the Rose Storm, or its remnants, is heavy rainfall in Baja California, southwestern Sonora and the desert southwest of the United States, the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause flash floods and life-threatening storm surges in the desert, and landslides in the mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton assault: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Sunday around 4:00 a.m. British time.
He was taken to the hospital where he remains in a stable condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock, Avon and Somerset area, according to the flotilla.
The police are asking anyone who may have cell phone footage of what happened to contact the police.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had suffered the indignities and wrath of the Democratic Party.
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is voting against the Democratic Party's rudeness and shocking tactics", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had suffered the indignities of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blaze Ford's accusation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the arraignment about her indictment.
The president said on Saturday that the American people saw the brilliance and the quality and the courage of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to confirm the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm the appointment of one of the finest legal minds of our time, a jurist with a distinguished record of public service", he told an audience of supporters in West Virginia.
The president was indirect about Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about the importance of Republicans getting to vote in the midterm elections.
Five weeks to go until one of the most important votes of our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I'm actually a candidate, he said.
And so I run around to fight for great candidates.
Trump claimed that the Democrats were on a mission to resist and interfere.
A senior Republican aide told CNN that the first Senate-wide central procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami, and the number is rising
At least 384 people were killed, many of them swept away by huge waves that crashed on the beaches, when a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, official sources reported on Saturday.
A huge crowd gathered for the beach festival in the city of Palo on Friday, as waves that rose to a height of 6 meters (18 feet) crashed on the beach at sunset, sweeping many to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was triggered by a 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still doing their business on the beach and did not immediately flee, and they were victimized", said Sotofu Puruo Noruho, spokesman for the BNPB disaster management agency, at a briefing in Gakatta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it dragged cars, wooden beams, houses, it hit everything on the ground", said Norojo, adding that the tsunami advanced over the open sea at a speed of 800 km (497 miles per hour) before hitting the coastline.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palo.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed the destruction of a large number of houses and shops, twisted bridges and courses and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Bureau of Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) in Indonesia noted in a statement that the energy released in Friday's powerful quake was 200 times greater than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
He said it's possible that the geography of the city, sitting on the edge of a long, narrow bay, magnified the size of the tsunami.
Norhoe described the destruction as "tremendous" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Noroho said the death toll and damage could be greater along the 300-km (190-mile) coastline of North Palo, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter.
Communications are completely down and there is no information from the Dongola, Norho said.
"The area is home to more than 300,000 people", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its people and volunteers were on their way to affected areas.
"It's a tragedy now, but it could get much worse", he said.
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticized for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palo, even though officials said the waves had arrived when the warning was issued.
In an amateur video that has been circulating on social media, a man can be seen on the roof of a high-rise building shouting hysterical tsunami warnings to the people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water collapses on the shore, carrying with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the footage.
The quake and tsunami caused widespread power outages that cut communications around Palo and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending transport planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say, but the survivors are still in desperate need of food and other vital supplies.
The city's airport is open only for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Goku and his team are scheduled to visit the rescue centers in Palo on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to over 800.
It's very difficult.
As World Vision personnel from Dongola arrived safely in the city of Palo, where workers were holed up in bar-lined shelters set up in their office yards, they passed scenes of destruction on their way, Mr. Dusba said.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed", he said.
It's very difficult.
Even as relief teams began their disastrous disaster relief operations, there were complaints that experienced foreign aid workers were prevented from reaching the palace.
According to Indonesian regulations, the flow of funds, supplies and people from other countries can only begin if the affected area is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't been done yet.
"It's still defined as a provincial-level disaster", said Uleah Ariani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster", we can open the door to international aid, but that status hasn't been announced yet.
As the second night falls on Palo after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and relatives of the missing are holding out hope that their loved ones will be the miracles that illuminate the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy is dragging a toilet.
On Sunday, rescuers pulled out a woman who had been buried under the rubble for two days, with her mother's body by her side.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia's paratroop team, trained two missing paratroopers ahead of the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others trapped in the hotel were seers, among them Mr. Mangi, and his students.
"As a veteran of the parachute extension field, I carry a negative emotional load", he said.
Mr. Gandon recalled how in the hours after news of the See-saw hotel collapse broke among the wider paratroopers community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Fallujah contestants who were taking part in the beach festival.
But his posts showed only one gray checkmark instead of a pair of blue ones.
"I think it means the messages were not delivered", he said.
Thieves withdrew $26,750 during an ATM refill at Newport on the Levee.
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver emptied a cash register at the entertainment complex and was preparing to bring in more money, investigator Dennis McCarthy wrote in a post.
While he was busy, another man ran behind a Brink's employee and stole a purse with money to fill in the ATM.
A witness saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the report, but police did not specify how many people were involved.
Anyone with any information about their identities should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kenya West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, "The entity formerly known as Kanye West".
The 41-year-old West has been affectionately known as Ye for some time and used the nickname as the name of his eighth album, which came out in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on the television show Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande who canceled her participation due to "emotional reasons", the show's creator said.
In addition to being the abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible the word means 'you'", West said earlier this year, when discussing the name of his album with Big Boy radio host.
So I'm you, I'm we, this is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the one and only, to RK -- just a reflection of the good in us, the bad in us, or the confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are".
He's one of a number of famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known alternately as Puff Daddy, Pee Daddy or Didi, but this year he announced he prefers the names "Love" and "Brotherly Love".
West's former partner, Jay Z, has also switched between the bold and the bold versions of his name.
The president of Mexico has pledged not to use the military against civilians.
Mexico's president-elect, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has pledged never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody crackdown on students.
Lopez Obrador pledged Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that he would never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.
Military forces opened fire on a non-violent demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing some 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were beginning to develop throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has committed to supporting young Mexicans by providing financial support to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are driving young people into gangs.
The U.S. needs to double its funding of AI.
As China's AI activity increases, the US should double the amount it invests in AI research, says AI researcher Kai-Fu Li, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments come after various parts of the US government have issued statements about AI, even though the US government has no official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it aims to be number one in artificial intelligence by 2030.
"Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the U.S., and we're looking for the next AI breakthrough", he told me.
Doubling the funding could double the chances that the next big AI achievement will be achieved in the U.S., he told CNBC in an interview this week.
Li, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" is published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in China's most prominent artificial intelligence company, Face++ .
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that defeated the US number one ranked player, and later served as a senior manager at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
I'm familiar with previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and the question of when the next one will be, to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government grants, he said.
It's not China that's taking our leading academics, it's the corporations that are doing it, he told me.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have in recent years recruited stars from universities to work in the field of artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. bolster its efforts in artificial intelligence.
"I think that a green card should be automatically offered to PhD holders in the field of artificial intelligence", he said.
In July 2017, China's State Council released its next generation artificial intelligence development plan.
The China National Science Foundation gives funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way to the way the National Science Foundation and other government agencies give funding to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is intended to bring together industry and academia partners, and the White House announced the creation of a dedicated AI committee.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an AI initiative called AI Next.
And as for the NSF, it's currently investing over 100 million dollars a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, a legislative initiative in the United States to create a national security committee for artificial intelligence has been dormant for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
Macedonians vote in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change its name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that will resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has prevented it from joining the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its neighbor to the north is a territorial claim to Greece and has vetoed its accession to NATO and the European Union.
The two countries signed a deal in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would harm the ethnic identity of Macedonia's predominantly Slavic population.
President Georgy Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign cast doubt on whether the voter turnout would meet the 50 percent minimum required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot is, "Do you support joining NATO and the European Union with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zeev, argue that it is a price worth paying to allow Macedonia, one of the states that emerged from the breakup of Yugoslavia, to join bodies such as the European Union and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live in freedom under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means a safe life for all of us", said 79-year-old Oliva Georgievska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, enough MPs have said they will abide by the results of the vote to make it binding.
To change the name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission said there were no irregularities as of 1:00 p.m.
However, the voter turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of eligible voters turned out to vote.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe", said 62-year-old Josip Tanevski, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Ze'ev, his wife Zurica and son Doshko shake their ballot in Stromitsa, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018, in Macedonia's referendum on changing the country's name, which opened the door to its joining NATO and the European Union.
In front of the Parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kovardakov set up a small stage and chairs in front of tents set up by those boycotting the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads held high, not through the server door", said Koorderkov.
We are a poor country, but we have honor.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian Union.
Prime Minister Zeev said that NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, where unemployment is above 20 percent.
I believe that the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO, Zaev said after voting.
He said a positive result would be "safeguarding our future".
A poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - less than the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian television network Telma TV, found that 57 of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, the voting percentage needs to be at least 50 percent plus one.
The referendum's failure would be the first significant loss of the pro-Western government's policy since it took power in May last year.
Manchester City player Sergio Aguero navigated through Brighton's entire defence to score a goal.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke through Brighton's defence in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It looked like Aguero was taking the gate easy.
The Argentine forward got a midfield pass at the start of the sequence.
He ran through three Brighton defenders before breaking into the open.
At this point, Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed around one shield before running up a few more shields on the Brighton wide border.
Then he kicked a left-handed pass, and found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the backyard to pass the ball back to Jaguar, who with his right foot kicked Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a right-footed shot.
"Jaguarro suffers from foot problems", Manchester City's manager told reporters.
We agreed he'd play for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he was a goat at that moment".
But it was Sterling who gave the Skylarks the starting edge in the Premier League.
This goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton's territory during that.
He threw a great pass right-handed to Leroy Sane.
Sanna scrambled the ball before leading Sterling to the far post.
The Sky Blues player squeezed the ball into the net just before he skated off the field.
Manchester City will take on Oppenheim in the Champions League home game on Tuesday at 12:55 at Rhein-Nacher Stadium in Zeissheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play spoiler against the Rockies.
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there was no good reason to force another start.
But Scherzer, who is a very competitive player, hopes to win Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if it still has playoff implications for the Rockies, who are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have secured at least an open card berth with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but have yet to secure first place at home.
"Even though we're playing for nothing, at least we can be able to play knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the fans and the second team will play at the highest level probably at every point I'll face you this year.
Why wouldn't I want to face that?"
The Nationals have yet to announce the starter for Sunday, but they're reportedly inclined to let the minister serve in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will be his 34th start, has been training at the Bulpan on Thursday and will be serving his rest day on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander has an 18-7 record with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump has a stop in West Virginia.
The president indirectly alluded to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court nominee, Burt Kavanaugh, as he spoke of the importance of Republicans coming out to vote in the midterm elections.
Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five more weeks to the most important election of our lives.
It's one of the reasons, the reason -- I'm not running, but I'm actually running, so I'm running around and fighting for great candidates", he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see this horrible group of radical Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And if you're determined to take back power by any means necessary, you see the convictions, the vices.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control, that's what they want is power and control, we're not going to give it to them".
The Democrats are, he says, on a mission to resist and interfere.
And you see it over the last four days, he said, calling the Democrats "angry and mean and mean and dishonest".
He mentioned the minority leader on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, by name, drawing high-pitched disdain from the crowd.
Remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Oh, oh, what.
No, oh no, I waited until -- that was really bad body language -- worst body language I've ever seen".
The Labour Party is no longer a pluralistic place.
She's intolerant of those who express their opinions.
When the momentum activists at my local party branch voted to censor me, it was not really a surprise.
After all, I am the last in a line of Labour MPs who have been told they are unwelcome - and only because we have spoken our minds.
My colleague in parliament, Gwen Ryan, was given the same treatment because she stood up vigorously against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the decision to censor me was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe -- ironically, on issues similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous party leaders.
At the East Nottingham Labour Party meeting committee on Friday it was said that "we want the meeting to be nightly and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the Friday night General Committee meetings were exactly like that.
Unfortunately, this is no longer the tone of many of the meetings and the promise of a more polite, gentler politics is long forgotten, if it ever was.
It's becoming increasingly clear that the Labour Party has no tolerance for different views, and every opinion is judged by how acceptable it is to the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy was elected party leader, when colleagues who I thought we shared similar political views began to expect him to make a statement and take positions that I would never have otherwise agreed to - whether it was on national security or the single European market.
Every time I speak in public -- and it doesn't really matter what I say -- immediately there's a barrage of abuse of my testimony on social media with calls for rejection, condemnation of the Centre's policies and calls that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm luckier than many of my colleagues, because the comments that are directed at me tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face every day a flood of racist abuse but never back down.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how levels of abuse have become a matter of routine.
Jeremy Corbyn argued last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we're already in the same pluralistic place, and with every vote of no confidence or change in the selection rules, the party gets more troubled.
Over the last two years, I've been advised by many to shut my mouth, not be so loud, and then I'll be fine.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labor Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, frustrated by the neglect of the Thatcher government that had nearly dismantled my public school class, I've been looking for ways to fight for better social services for those who need them most -- whether as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I've never concealed my political opinions, including in the recent election.
No one in East Nottingham could in any way be confused as to my political views and controversial issues with my current leadership.
To those who voted for the motion on Friday, all I have to say is that as the country creeps towards a Brexit that will hurt our families, our businesses and our public service, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But in fact the one message I have is not to the Momentum Movement in Nottingham, but to my voting public, whether they are Labour Party members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats of expulsion or political expediency will deter me from acting in a way that I believe serves the best interests of all of you.

Air 38-17 from the Leros: the undefeated Air to the summit
The final two innings have slightly altered the final result, but there's no doubt that Ayr deserves to win in this exciting and wonderful match today in the Scottish Premiership.
They're now at the top of the table, the only undefeated side of the decade.
In the end, it was their better defense, as well as taking much more risks, that played to the home team's advantage, and Coach Peter Moretzchi had every reason to be pleased.
We've stood the test of our games so far, and we're still undefeated, so I must be happy, he said.
Robin Christie from the Melrose Group said: "Laurie deserves all the credit, they took risks better than we did".
A 14th-minute try from Grant Anderson, converted by Fraser Klemmo, put Ayr in the lead, but a yellow card for Scotland player Rory Hughes, released by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to score and Baggott's Jason Baggott caught an uncapped try.
Climaux took the lead off of Ayr with a pass, before the half, he was the ram and then converted a solo try to get 17-5 to Ayr at the half.
But Melrose opened the second half well and Patrick Angerson's newest, overridden by a goat, narrowed the gap to five points.
After a long delay due to a serious injury to Roderick Knaut, who was taken off the bench, and the resumption of play, Ayr extended the gap through Stafford McDowell's try, which was converted by Climo.
Air's alternate captain Blair MacPherson then received a yellow card, and once again Melrose took advantage of the other man with Bruce Colvin's no-hump tread, ending a string of tremendous pressure.
But the home team recovered, and while Strawn Hutchinson was given a yellow card for attacking Clemmo without a ball, from the penalty spot, McPherson scored a touchdown behind Ayr's advanced goal.
Clima was the mayor, as he did again almost from the return to the game, after Kyle Roy ace punched a David Armstrong and sent the Henry Gregorian calf to the home team's sixth tee.
Still Game star looks ready for a new career in the restaurant business.
Still Game star, Ford Kearnan, seems ready to move into the restaurant business after it's revealed he's been named as the manager of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes and stars in with long-time comedy partner Greg Hampill.
The pair have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the show's final season, and it seems that Kiernan is planning a life after Cryling.
According to official records, he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source at the Scottish Sun suggested that Kearnan was looking for ways to get into Glasgow's thriving restaurant business.
The sea is ours: Bolivia's no-go to sea hopes the court will open a path to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors are patrolling the Navy HQ, surrounded by a few ships in La Paz.
Public buildings are flying a navy blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon carry the slogan: "The sea is ours by right.
It is our duty to reclaim it".
Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in the bloody resource wars of the 19th century lives on - as does the longing to sail the Pacific again.
Those hopes may have been in the air for decades, as Bolivia awaits the International Court's decision on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace, and it is of course looking forward with a positive attitude to the future", said Roberto Calzadela, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will be watching the International Court of Justice ruling on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favor of Bolivia's demand that after decades of broken talks, Chile will negotiate sovereign access to the sea for Bolivia.
Bolivia's charismatic native president, Evo Morales - who faces a controversial re-election battle next year - will have a lot to decide on Monday.
"We're very close to returning to the Pacific", he promised at the end of August.
But commentators say there's little chance the court will rule in Bolivia's favor - and that even if it does, it won't make much difference.
The court of the Hague has no jurisdiction to grant Chilean territory, and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of any possible talks.
The fact that the ICC ruling came only six weeks after hearing the final arguments indicates that the case was not complicated, but rather it was complicated, as explained by Paz Zarreta, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of advancing Bolivia's claims, the last four years may even have weakened them.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian government", Zarata said.
Morales' bellicose rhetoric wiped out any remaining goodwill on the part of Chile, she said.
Eventually, Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but it will be very difficult to have a discussion after that.
The two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The previous president, Eduardo Rodríguez Valcea, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, dismissed the idea that the court's decision was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will have a great opportunity to usher in a new era in relations with Chile and hopefully end 139 years of conflict for both sides, he said.
Claudilla also denied that Morales - who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - is using the maritime issue as political leverage.
Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean, he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see that we must overcome the past.
North Korea says a nuclear dismantling won't happen unless it can trust the U.S.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong, said that his country would never dismantle its nuclear weapons first if it could not trust Washington.
Ri is speaking Saturday at the General Assembly of the Wham.
He called on the UAE to keep the promises made during the Singapore summit between the leaders of the two rival states.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears on the verge of reopening diplomatic talks on nuclear weapons that have stalled more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was "a pipe dream" to think that continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to declaring an end to the Korean War would force North Korea to kneel.
The United States is concerned that it will agree to the declaration without North Korea first taking significant steps to denuclearize.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump are interested in a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that North Korea is serious about giving up its nuclear weapons stockpile, which it likely sees as the only way to protect its security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to set up a second summit between Kim and Trump.
A Paris fashion show reveals the new trend in giant hats that are making their way to luxury stores everywhere.
We have a solution for anyone who wants to expand their hat collection or get complete protection from the sun.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown unveiled a line of giant, crazy headgear for their SS19 collection at a fashion show that capped the Paris Fashion Week.
Obviously, impractical hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and these designers have brought their extraordinary creations to the runway.
Valentino's signature item was an oversized, beige hat with a wide, feather-like border that covered the models' heads.
Other large-size accessories included decorated turbans, a magic hat and even a pineapple - but they were not meant to protect the head from the cold.
Tom Brown also unveiled a selection of bizarre masks - check it out for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks included lips sewn and blood more like Hannibal Lecter than Hot Couture.
One piece mentioned a diving mask including snorkel and goggles, and another one looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And for those who want to continue with a trendy, infinite-dimensional statement, their time has come.
Fashion connoisseurs are watching as giant boots make their way into luxury stores everywhere.
The giant hats are the next big thing after the "La Bomba", the straw hat with half a meter-wide brims that was seen on everyone from Mariana to Emily Ratajkowski.
The label behind the highly impractical hat that flooded social media has spawned another great creation on the trail -- a backpack nearly as big as the one of a model in a bathing suit who wore it.
The colorful, burnished-in-the-face, with a fluffy brim and white leather handles, was the highlight of the SS19 collection at the Jacqueline La Rivière fashion week in Paris.
Renowned stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I anticipate big hats and big seashells will hit the luxury shops next summer - because design has made a huge impression and it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding test results, reinforced by individual and group success in sport, the arts, music and other areas of community engagement.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to give the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, for careers in which they will be chosen and empowered as citizens of the world.
As an education sector that is able to design and implement a personalized curriculum, we find that modern languages continue to gain popularity as a desired subject in school.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head".
If you speak to a man in his own language, it goes to his heart".
This is an important reminder that we can't rely on English alone when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
In the results of the last year's exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the charts with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who took foreign languages, got high A's.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved a high A in Mandarin, as did 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish.
These data show that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as essential skills that children and teenagers will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, languages are considered to be at the same level as STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) subjects in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the British Council for Employment and Skills found that among the reasons employers cited for their lack of time to fill vacancies, 17 percent were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, increasingly, language skills are becoming a vital requirement to prepare students for future careers.
Given the increasing demands on languages for future job opportunities, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
No matter what career one chooses, if one has learned a second language, one will have a significant advantage in the future because of this lifelong ability.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically puts a person at an advantage over competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language at a level sufficient to carry on a conversation, and French was the only language with a two-digit percentage of speakers, 15 percent.
That's why it's important to invest in language teaching for kids today.
Knowing many languages, especially those of developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
Within Scotland, every school will be different in terms of the languages it teaches.
Some schools will focus on more modern classical languages, while others will teach languages considered most important for Britain looking ahead to the 20th and 21st centuries, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
No matter what the child's interest is, there will always be a variety of languages to choose from in the independent schools, with a staff of teachers who specialize in the field.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, in any foreseeable future.
There is no denying that today, in a global business environment, languages continue to be vital to the future of the country, and this fact should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages have what is called "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer these levels of choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland's children.
It's an hourly order.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools.
LeBron is scheduled to make his Laker debut Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is over for fans who have been waiting to see LeBron James play for the first time with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the season opener against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego.
But it's not yet clear how many minutes he'll play.
That's more than one and less than 48", the Lakers' official website says.
Lakers reporter Mike Troodle tweeted that James will likely play a limited number of minutes.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six preseason games.
"At this stage of my career I don't need preseason games to prepare", he said.
Trump's time in West Virginia, his YouTube channel
President Donald Trump opens with a flurry of election stops tonight in Wheeling, Virginia.
This is the first of five planned stops for Trump this week, including stops in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While voting to confirm his nomination as a Supreme Court Justice, Trump is looking to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how can we watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to begin at 7:00 PM Eastern Time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally online live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address the rumors this week that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh has become embroiled in a controversy over allegations of sexual misconduct and subsequently the postponement of the Senate vote for a week while the FBI investigates the allegations.
But the primary purpose of this shutdown is to help Republicans facing a challenging November election gain some momentum.
So President Trump's campaign said the goal of these five stops next week is to "encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so critical to his agenda that the president is prepared to visit as many countries as possible as the election season enters into its peak", a spokesman for Trump's campaign told Reuters, asking to remain anonymous.
Tonight's rally, scheduled to take place at Westbank Stadium in Wheeling, could bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw media coverage from Pittsburgh, West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president should come in to try to improve his polling record", said Simon Heider, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team shows a willingness to fight to keep hope alive ahead of the singles on Sunday.
After three one-sided years, Sunday afternoon's four-way match-up may be just what the Ryder Cup needs.
The swinging motion of momentum is a completely invented sporting concept, but the players really believe in it, and never more than in competitions like this.
So where do they think we're gonna find the momentum now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so you can see a bit of momentum in that", said Spitzer Gordon at the end of the day.
Europe is in the lead of course, four points ahead with 12 more to go.
But the Americans, as Spith says, feel they have a bit of spirit in their sails, and they have a lot to cheer about, not least in the form of Spith and Justin Thomas playing together all day and each of them boasting three points out of four.
Spitzer was a deadly Green Lantern and he leads by example.
The cheers grew stronger as his round went on, as he's sinking Pat Critic to win the game four all-square and Thomas down two for two.
His 15on-winning shot earned a similar outcry, the kind that shows he believes the American team still has hope.
"You really just have to dig deep and worry about your own game", said Spitzer.
That's all any of these players have left to do.
18 bricks to leave their mark.
The only players with more points than Mephit and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Mullinery and Tommy Fleetwood, the Ryder Cup's undisputed leading storyteller.
Europe's weird but charming pair are four out of four and the darlings of all.
"Mollywood was the only duo that didn't shoot the bogey on a Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on a Saturday morning, on a Friday afternoon and after nine on a Friday morning.
That same round, and the way their energy seems to be flowing to and from the enthusiastic crowd, establishes the fact that they are the players to win on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Moulinary to seal the potential European victory with the sun setting on Le Golf National.
Better both at the same time in separate walls.
However, it is too early to speak of European glory.
Bobbie and Tason and Webb Simpson have finished with Sergio Garcia, hero of the Four Balls of the Morning, as he is robbed with Alex Noreen.
Bogey and two double-niners had the Spaniards and Swedes in a hole they couldn't get out of.
However, on Sunday there's no one to help you out of the hole.
It's fascinating to look closely at the four balls and the fours because of the interactions between the twins, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way strategy can change in the blink of an eye.
Europe has played better as a team so far and leads significantly on the final day, but this quarterfinal session has shown that the American team is full of fighting spirit that some, especially within the United States, have questioned.
Europe leads 10-6 heading into the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe has a healthy lead heading into the final day of the Ryder Cup after winning all four of Saturday's four-ball ties with a 10-6 victory over the United States.
The inspirational pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the change with two wins over struggling Tiger Woods, and brought the gap so far in Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, trying to defend the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, took on the Americans who missed the four-ball this morning, bringing the series to 3-1.
The American players showed more resistance in the quarterfinals, and won two games, but failed to close the gap.
To keep the trophy, the Jim Furyk team needs eight points from 12 singles matches.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while he and Moolenaar, who earned the nickname "Mollywood" after an extraordinary weekend, are only the second pair to score four points from their opening four games in Ryder Cup history.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reid in the four-ball games, they went on in stunning harmony together to defeat the emaciated Woods and the rookie American Jason DeCampo by an even more remarkable score of 5 and 4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, has shown random bursts of excellence, but so far he has lost 19 of 29 games of the four ball and four four, and seven games in a row.
Justin Rose, who was injured during the morning four-ball game, returned to join Henrik Stenson in the quarterfinals to defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, ranked No. 1 and No. 3 in the world, 2 and 1 respectively.
However, not everything went smoothly for the European players in the fine weather and the light wind blowing southwest of Paris.
The three-time outstanding winner Gordon Spieth and Justin Thomas set the bar for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won 2-1 over John Ram of Spain and Ian Poulter in the four-ball games and later came back to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the quarterfinals, after losing the first two rounds.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team come back from a four-point deficit to the sole match, although as holders of the trophy, Forrick's men need only the tie to keep the trophy.
However, after being second for two days, it seems that a counterattack on Sunday is beyond their control.
North Korea says it will in no way unilaterally disarm without trust
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday in Ba'ath that continued sanctions deepen its distrust of the United States and that there is no chance the country would unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
Ri Yong-ho announced at the annual UN General Assembly that North Korea has "made significant goodwill actions" in the past year, such as halting nuclear missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and pledging to no longer develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we don't see any coordinated response from the United States", he said.
Without trust in the United States, we cannot be sure of our national defense and under such conditions we will in no way unilaterally disarm ourselves first.
While Sheri repeated North Korea's well-known complaints about the US's opposition to a "progressive" approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded by taking incremental steps, his statement seemed important in that it did not push for denuclearization, as North Korea had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to work toward the "nuclear dismantling of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump promised to protect the security of North Korea.
North Korea has asked for an official end to the 1950-1953 Korean War, but the United States has said that North Korea must first give up its nuclear weapons.
The United States has also opposed calls to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
"The Arab world is insisting on nuclear disarmament first and increasing the pressure of sanctions to achieve its goal by means of coercion, even opposing the declaration of an end to the war", Ri said.
The notion that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a pipe dream in the asphyxiation of people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the escalating sanctions are deepening our mistrust".
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US president highlighted in his State of the Union address earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding: "If the other side of the denuclearization issue were South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a dead end".
However, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that a US ground attack by North Korean missiles was inevitable after the evil president Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who last year threatened the total destruction of North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said there was still much work to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea was disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for that, adding that whether it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter.
China and Russia have argued that the UN Security Council should reward North Korea for taking steps.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "the Security Council's enforcement of sanctions must continue with determination and without pause until we achieve full and verified final nuclear disarmament".
The Security Council has unanimously supported the imposition of sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to block funding for its ballistic missile and nuclear programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare the next summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, but hours later North Korea denounced him for making "gangster demands".
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to close a missile site and a nuclear facility if the U.S. takes "appropriate action".
He said Kim told him that the "matching measures" he was interested in include security guarantees that Trump had pledged in Singapore, as well as changes in the direction of normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on how to get enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year is teaching participants how to sleep more, in an attempt to combat the expanding matzo culture of learning by staying up all night on caffeine.
An academic study found that students at the world's top universities often have no idea of the basic principles of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Kesseler, a sleep science professor at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which is thought to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
And at the end of the talk, a girl came up to me and said, "Why are you telling me this only now, in my senior year?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep -- which, to my surprise, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is being offered for the first time this year, explains to students the principles of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their overall well-being.
Paul Breyer, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and senior director of health services at the university, said the university decided to open the course after discovering that students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The hour-long course includes a series of interactive assignments.
One section features a picture of a dorm room, where students are pressing coffee cups, curtains, sports clothes and books -- to get explanations about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, as well as the importance of a bedtime routine.
In another, participants were told how prolonged sleep deprivation could increase their risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
After that, a map of the campus, with interactive symbols, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
We know that it doesn't change the behavior of students overnight.
But we think they have a right to know - just like you have a right to know the effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes", added Professor Zeissler.
He said the culture of pride in "successfully getting through the night without sleeping" still exists, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students are causing the problem of sleep deprivation to grow.
Getting enough sleep, and getting good sleep, should be every student's secret weapon to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in a starvation mode, so we're hungry all the time.
Raymond Sue, a 19-year-old student from California studying chemical biology and physics, helped Professor Chessler design the course, after attending one of his classes in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to encourage a campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, will be to require all graduate students to complete a similar curriculum before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Chazel recommends that students explore the possibility of setting a timer to ring when it is time to go to sleep, not just when to wake up, and to be alert to the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm and thus cause problems with falling asleep.
Mangala's goal is decisive for Gerard's players.
The Rangers suffered another onslaught of defeat in the away game when Dolly Monge caused Steven Gerrard's Rebels to lose 1-0 at Livingston.
The Ibrox side were hoping to take their first away game win since the 1-4 February win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side suffered only Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving the team eight points behind the Scottish League champions Hearts.
Mage attacked seven minutes before halftime and it didn't look like the Rangers' dispirited players were even.
While Rangers now slump to sixth, Livingstone climbs to third and just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And may be waiting for another Ranger's double after Colum Spence's head injury was treated after an object was apparently thrown at him from the bleachers.
Gerrard made eight substitutions on the team that beat Ayr to the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, came up with the same 11 Livingston players who took a point off the Hearts last week, and he could have been satisfied with the way his players held up the opponents in any situation.
The Rangers may have dominated the ball possession, but Livingston did more with the ball he had in his hands.
They almost got it in the second minute when Menga sent a ball to Scott Patman who kicked it into Alan McGregor's goal, but a midfielder kicked the ball too far.
A deep free kick from Keegan Jacob then found Captain Craig at the plate, but his defender Alan Lathgow could only kick out of the net.
The Rangers did take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their play in the final quarter.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he should be awarded the penalty after a quarter of an hour of play, when he and Steven Willis clashed, but the referee, Steven Thompson, was unimpressed with the Colombian's excuses.
The Rangers managed to kick only twice into the goal in the first half but Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily stopped the leap of Lashana Colibally and the weak kick of Obi Agharia.
While Livingstone's opening in the 34th minute was contrary to the way the game was played, no one would deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers failed to deal with a deep free-throw by Jacobs.
Scott Artfield did not respond as Declan Glager passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool in passing the ball to Managa for a simple finish.
Gerrard made a half-time action when he replaced Collibaly with Ryan Kent, and the changeup had an almost immediate effect when the winger/rounder passed the ball to Morelos but Kelly was running from his line to block.
But Livingston continues to force the visiting team to play exactly the kind of game she likes, as the Lions and Colts continue to send long balls.
Holt's team could have increased the lead in the other stages, but McGregor was well positioned to prevent a Jacobs attempt before the rebound was pulled from the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton later had another foul claim against Jacobs, but Thompson again ignored it.
The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, the German page of Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and on... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geer developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the device has become a mainstay of science, but in 1950 it also became a mainstay of pop culture thanks to the movie "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans as two oddball cowboys/scientists:
Man: "What the hell is this thing?"
Rogers: It's a Geiger counter, which is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you put on the headphones, you can actually hear the effects of radioactivity on the atoms in the minerals".
Oh, my God, it's really popping now!"
Hans Geiger passed away in 1945, shortly before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see cancer cells and kill them.
A vaccine teaches the immune system to identify cancer cells as part of a treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, and altering the cells in the lab
The cells can then identify a protein that is common to many cancers and then they're injected back into the patient.
An experimental vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
In one woman who received a vaccine that taught the immune system to recognize cancer cells, ovarian cancer went away for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, changing the cells in the lab so that they can express a protein called HER2 that is common to many cancers, and then injecting the cells back into the patient.
Professor Jay Brozovsky, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 inhibits the development of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer, explained Prof. Brozupsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and teaching them how to attack cancer cells has been successful in treating a type of blood cancer.
Kanye West broke into a pro-Trump speech with a MAGA hat on his head after his appearance on SNL.
It was not well received.
Kanye West responds to booze calls in the studio during a confused performance on Saturday Night Live, praising US President Donald Trump and saying he will run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song on the show, "Just Town", during which he wore a Make America Great hat, he broke into a rallying cry against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"So many times I talk to white people who say, 'How can you love Trump, he's a racist?'
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago, he said.
The SNL episode opened with a sketch starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked the testimony of Bert Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee, regarding allegations of sexual assault made against Christine Blaze Ford.
Although the speech was not aired on the show, the clip was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rook was trying to frame West in the publicity stunt.
Also, West complained to the audience that he was criticized behind the scenes for the hat he wears.
They attacked me backstage.
They said, "Al, you're going to go on stage with that hat on".
They attacked me!
And then they said I was in a dark place, he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "You want to see the dark place?" by saying he's wearing my Superman hat, because that means no one can tell me what to do.
Try to show love".
His remarks were booed at least twice by the audience, and SNL staffers appeared to be confused, Variety reported, with one saying to the newspaper, "A hollow silence has fallen in the entire studio".
West is adding to the program as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former partner, Mac Miller, died just days before.
West stunned many when he performed the song I Love It when he was dressed as a bottle perrier.
West was backed by the head of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the bravest souls: thank you for not giving in to the crowd".
But the host of the reality show Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just "who he is and it's totally wonderful".
But I chose not to reciprocate (by buying his music or his clothing or supporting his art) that I believe embraces and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so are we, she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "the entity formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Diddy, Papi and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Duke, went by the name Snoop Lion, and of course the famous musician Prince changed his name to the symbol and then to the coach formerly known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder following a stabbing at a restaurant in Belfast.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a pub in East Belfast on Friday.
Police say the incident took place in Bilyashmore.
The suspect is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the public prosecutor's office.
Game of Thrones star Keith Harrington is attacking the toxic masculinity of
Kit Harrington is best known for his role as Snow White in the swordplay fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such on-screen characters often convey to young children the message that they must be tough to be respected.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he thought something was wrong and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married another Game of Thrones star, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted he was very concerned about addressing this issue.
"Personally, I'm feeling very disturbed right now -- where did we go wrong with masculinity?" he said.
What do we teach men in their growing up period, from the perspective of the problem we're witnessing now?
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity, because of the very masculine characters it presents.
He went on: What comes from within and what do we learn from without?
What is it that we learn from television, and in the street, that makes young boys feel that they have to be on this particular side of being a man?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time -- how does that change?
Because something definitely went wrong for young men.
In the interview, he admitted that he would not participate in any sequel or spin-off series of Game of Thrones after the series ended the following summer, saying that he was done with battlefields and horses.
Starting in November, Keith will star in a new version of Sam Shepard's play "A True Western", which tells the story of a filmmaker and his bandit brother.
The actor recently revealed that he sees meeting his wife Rose as the best thing that has happened to him as a result of the Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on the show, so in that way the show gave me my future family, and my life from that moment on", he said.
Rose played the role of Yegrit, the love object of Snow's Gundam, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The two were married in June 2018 in the courtyard of the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
China reports 14% increase in new HIV/AIDS cases
China has announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are afflicted with the disease, according to official health officials.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second half of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases are sexually transmitted, which is a change from the past.
So far, HIV has spread rapidly in parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, according to official health officials in China at a conference in Yunnan province.
Yet, year-over-year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV infections are a burning issue in the Chinese gay community.
Homosexuality ceased to be illegal in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of the disease are the result of inadequate use of these sexual defenses.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has ensured universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her staff leaked information about a Republican senator and denounces the "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Senator Maxine Waters on Saturday denied accusations that a member of her staff posted personal information about three U.S. senators on the senators' Wikipedia pages.
The Democratic senator from Los Angeles has said the allegations are being spread by far-right websites and visitors.
"Lies, lies and more abhorrent lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information surfaced online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a hearing before the Senate Select Committee on Improper Sexual Conduct against Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kawano.
Conservative websites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identified the source of the posts was linked to Waters' office and posted the information about a Waters staff member, Hill reported.
"This baseless accusation is completely false and a complete lie", Waters added.
My crew member -- whose identity and personal details were exposed and his security compromised as a result of these false and inaccurate accusations -- was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This baseless accusation is completely false and a complete lie".
Waters' announcement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
This is the angry denial, Fleischer wrote.
It's a sign she doesn't have the temperament required of a congressman.
When someone is accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't react in anger.
He can't react in a hostile way.
He must not question the motives of the accused.
He should be calm and quiet".
Fletcher appeared to be comparing Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of looking too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Novarro, the Republican candidate trying to defeat Waters in the midterm elections, also tweeted his thoughts.
"Great if it's true", he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said her office has contacted the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies regarding these false allegations.
We're going to make sure that the perpetrators are discovered and brought to justice for all their destructive and dangerous acts against my crew.
The film is a parody of espionage, starring Rowan Atkinson.
It's now common to look for Brexit implications in any new film with a British point of view, and it does seem appropriate for this revival of the action-comedy parody of the series Johnny English -- which started somewhere around 2003 with Johnny English and was revived in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Will ironic self-deprecation about how worthless we are become our country's new export opportunity?
In any case, the smooth-talking, rubber-faced, blue-eyed Englishman was given another chance to spoil things - and his name more than anything is a broad comic work intended for the cinema of non-English-speaking countries.
He is, of course, the silly English agent, who despite his strange posture to a slick glare looks a bit like Clouseau, a bit like Mr. Bean and more like this guy who contributed a single note to the sound of the chariots of fire in the opening text of the London Olympics in 2012.
It is also originally based on the mysterious international traveler portrayed by Atkinson in the forgotten television commercials for Barclaycard, leaving chaos behind.
There's a nice minute or two in the latest edition of Johnny English.
I love the part where Johnny English approaches the helicopter wearing his medieval armour, and the pusher's lips ring for a moment on his helmet.
Atkinson demonstrates his comic physical abilities, but humor feels rather weak and oddly redundant, especially since the more serious types of spy films like 007 and Mission: Impossible themselves now include a comic element.
The humor feels like it's addressed to children instead of adults, and in some ways the crazy, failed adventures of Johnny English are less glamorous and focused than Atkinson's silent-film-style jokes as Mr. Bean.
The plot of the film begins when great danger threatens Britain.
A hacker has hacked the top-secret British spy network, exposing the identities of all British agents on the ground, much to the dismay of the lead agent - a small role sadly for Kevin Aldon.
It's the final straw for a haughty, war-weary prime minister who's already suffering from a complete collapse of political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best to fill the role of Theresa May-like, but she doesn't have much to work with from the script.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that since every active spy has been exposed, she'll have to bring someone back from retirement.
And that means the English rabbinical goon in his own right, who is now employed as a schoolmaster at a prestigious institution, but gives informal lessons on how to be an undercover spy: some good jokes here, when English offers a spy academy in the style of the School of Rock.
English is brought back to Whitehall for emergency briefing and reunites with his former assistant for the painful Boff, played again by Ben Miller.
Boff is now a married man to a submarine commander, in the role of the queen of a class of annoying people on whom Vicko Pepperdine is a bit of a waste.
So Batman and Robin of the Queen's Secret Service get into a terrible mess, and back in action is the beautiful Pam-Patal, played by Ophelia Boltova and played by Olga Korylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is falling dangerously under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems - the evil Jason Volta in the guise of Jake Lacey.
English and Boff begin their odyssey that is more of a farce of two clowns: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a posh French restaurant; they create a wonderland as they smuggle themselves onto Volta's luxury yacht; and English demonstrates absolute anarchy in his attempt to use a virtual reality bar to learn the inner structure of Volta's house.
No doubt every effort is made to lead to the final sequence, but despite the likes and dislikes, it has a children's TV feel to it.
It's a fairly average level.
And like all the other English-language films, I couldn't help but think: Couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is preparing a plan for the British to work four days a week but to be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a revolutionary plan whereby the British will work four days a week - but be paid for five.
The party reportedly wants company executives to pass on the savings from the AI revolution to workers in the form of an extra day off.
That means the workers will have a three-day weekend, and they'll still get the same pay.
Sources say the idea is in keeping with the company's economic agenda and plans to tilt the state in favor of workers.
The Trades Union Congress is supporting the transition to a four-day work week as a way for workers to benefit from the changes in the economy.
A senior Labour source told the Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
It won't happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an ambition that fits the party's approach to rebalancing the economy for workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
Labour would not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party called for a four-day work week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, the ambition is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: "A four-day work week is not party policy and the party is not considering it".
Labor's candidate for Treasury Secretary, John McDonnell, used the party convention last week to articulate his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to re-empower faceless executives and price-fixers in service companies.
The Treasury candidate's plans also suggest that current shareholders of water companies may not get their full investment back because the Labour government may make "reductions" based on the disclosure of improper behavior.
It also confirms that plans exist to incorporate employees into company boards and to create "inclusive-cost funds" to transfer 10% of the capital of private sector companies to employees, which would pocket two-year dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told 60 Minutes that if the FBI investigation into Quano changes their minds,
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination by at least a week, raising the question of whether the findings of the investigation will convince any of the Republicans to withdraw their support.
In a segment aired Sunday on 60 Minutes, reporter Scott Pelly asked Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina party colleague.
"So, of course", said Kennedy.
"I said in the lead-up to the hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, the blame came up, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was resolute, determined, unwavering".
Whereas Graham's finger appears to be carved into the rock.
I've already decided on Burt Cavanaugh and a bombshell indictment will be needed, he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Bert denied it in force", Graham added, referring to Christine Blaze Ford.
And no one she mentioned could verify that.
This is 36 years old.
I can't see how anything can change".
What is the World Citizens' Festival and has it contributed anything to poverty alleviation?
New York City Saturday will mark the World Citizens Festival, an annual music event with a most impressive roster of stars to show and an equally impressive goal of ending world poverty.
The World Citizens Festival, now in its seventh year, will bring tens of thousands of people to a large lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's true purpose - to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens Festival, which began in 2012, is the continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert must complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, calling or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness for the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful was the festival really, with only 12 years to go?
Is the idea of giving people free concert tickets really a way to convince them to demand a call to action, or is it another case of "ecclusivism" - people feeling like they're really making a difference by signing a petition online or tweeting?
Since 2011, the World Citizens Organization says it has identified more than 19 million actions by its supporters, pushing for a variety of different goals.
He says these actions have helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and declarations as a result of its operations, of which at least $10 billion has already begun to be distributed or raised.
The group estimates that the money allocated has so far directly impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK partnership of investors and philanthropists committed to helping children grow to their full potential, and pledging to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from citizens around the world.
With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make social justice on malnutrition a historic footnote", said The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman to the audience during the live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling for Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government has announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, that will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional intervention.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website that asked, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Citizen of the World: "It will be a long and difficult path - sometimes we fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mona are among several performers at this year's event in New York City, to be hosted by Debra-Lee Fornes and Yoo Jackman.
The US could use its navy to blockade Russian energy exports - Interior Minister
"If necessary, Washington can use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East", revealed U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zinke, as quoted in the Washington Examiner.
Zink argued that Russia's involvement in Syria -- which, it's important to note, was done at the invitation of the legitimate government -- is a pretext for expanding into new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they're in the Middle East is they want to broker energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe", he said, according to the report.
And according to the official source, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States can, with our fleet, make sure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, put up a fence to make sure that their energy sources don't reach the market", he said.
Zinke spoke to attendees at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that describes itself as the voice of energy consumers in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are indeed identical.
"The economic possibility for Iran and Russia is, more or less, leverage and exchange of fuel types", he said, referring to Russia as a one-trick pony because its economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come as the Trump administration is on a mission to increase its export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russian energy sources, which are a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to cancel its participation in the ill-fated Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has turned Berlin into a "captive" for Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which is supposed to double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's staunch opposition to the project is motivated purely by economic considerations and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool of coercion and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting in Moscow with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September.
The US position was met with a sharp backlash from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Industry Association (BDI), the leading organization in the German industrial sector, has called on the United States to keep its distance from the EU energy policy and from the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kampff, head of the German Industry Association (BDI), following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is seriously considering running for president in 2020, said the senator from Massachusetts.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would seriously consider running for president after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed her intention to run for president during a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to come to Washington to fix our broken government, and for that, it needs a woman at the top", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president.
Warren expressed her opinion of President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting, saying he was taking the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm worried to my bones about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has sharply criticized Trump for appointing Burt Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court Justice.
In a tweet posted on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll released on the day of the election showed that a majority of Warren's own voters do not think she should run in the 2020 election.
Fifty-eight percent of potential voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a survey by the Suffolk University Center for Policy Research and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the Senator's intention to run for president.
The poll showed that there is more support for former governor Deval Patrick's run, with 38 percent supporting his running versus 48 percent opposing it.
Related Democratic figures who have been mentioned in connection with a possible 2020 presidential run include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd make a formal decision in January, according to AP.
Sarah Palin is pointing out the post-traumatic stress disorder of Trace Palin at a rally for Donald Trump.
26-year-old Trak Palin spent a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on the night of the murder.
"What my son is going through, what he's been going through since he's come back, allows me to identify with families that are suffering the consequences of PTSD and some of the same vulnerabilities that our soldiers are recovering from", she told the crowd at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other released soldiers, "They come back a little different, they come back strong, they come back wondering if what they gave to the country their fellow soldiers and airmen, and all the other military people, is honored".
He was arrested on May 29 in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, obstruction of reporting on a domestic violence case, and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the challenge to the new asylum policy.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims fleeing situations involving gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District filed a court-ordered statement on Friday in Washington to support the challenge of the asylum-seeker policy, according to NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Susans, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August, has not been released.
She said she was abused by her violent boyfriend and gang members, but U.S. government officials denied her asylum request on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Grace's state counsel described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which are the top countries for asylum in the United States, as having many problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the BIA Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Rasin said in a statement on Wednesday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all discussions of asylum claims be based on the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and the barrier imposed by the new policy violates that principle", the court statement said.
The lawyers also argued in a statement that the policies, which prevent the entry of immigrants, harm the US economy, because they tend to become entrepreneurs and provide necessary work, they said.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges not to grant more asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"The political asylum is open to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear on the grounds of race, religion, nationality or membership in a specific social group or because of political opinion", Sushans said in a statement on the policy on June 11.
The goal of political asylum has never been to alleviate all the problems -- not even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palo, as casualties doubled in the race to find survivors.
For the survivors, the situation grew more difficult by the minute.
"It's a very tense feeling", said Risa Kosuma, a 35-year-old mother of a baby with a fever at the Falun Dafa Center in the ruined city.
Every minute the ambulance is bringing bodies.
Clean water is rare.
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, tearing through water-spoiled objects, trying to save whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 quake, were flooded.
Some of the injured, including Dewey Harris, who suffered from back and shoulder fractures, were outside the Palo Military Hospital, where they were being treated for severe aftershocks that continued after the earthquake.
Tears filled his eyes as he recounted how the violent earthquake shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
"I was pushed into the rubble of the wall, I think", Harris told the AP, adding that his family was in town to attend the wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, and then a hush.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're somewhere safe.
The US ambassador accuses China of bullying with propaganda ads.
A week after a Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a US daily, aggressively promoting the benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday addressed the Chinese newspaper China Daily on its payroll, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 U.S. Congressional elections, which China has rejected.
Trump's accusation that China tried to interfere in the US election marked a new stage, according to US officials, in Washington's escalation drive to put pressure on China.
Although foreign governments will naturally issue trade promotion notices, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a fierce trade war in which each country raises and equals tariffs on its rival's imports.
The tariffs, which China raised as a retaliatory action early in the trade war, were designed to hurt exporters from states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, American and Chinese experts said.
Terry Bernstadt, the U.S. ambassador to China, former longtime governor of Iowa, and a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Bernstad wrote in an opinion piece in the Sunday edition of The Motion Register, "is reinforcing the acts of bullying by advertising in our free press".
In its propaganda, the Chinese government is using America's cherished tradition of free speech and journalism, and is posting a paid ad in The Moone Register, Bernstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the newsstands on the streets of Beijing, you will find few opposing voices and you will see no real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have on the worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that "one of China's leading newspapers evaded the offer to publish his article", although he did not specify which newspaper.
The Republican Party is pushing women's votes away before the midterm elections.
As many Republican leaders stand with Supreme Court nominee Burt Kavanaugh defending him against a series of sexual assault allegations, analysts warn they'll see a backlash, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiment around the issue has been particularly vivid, with most Republicans formally demonstrating their willingness to move the ballot.
"These things can't be put back", Grant Rieher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Riher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute efforts to open an FBI investigation would be enough to appease angry voters.
"People are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they are not going to forget it tomorrow or in November", said Carine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive movement MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Sunday morning, protesters shouted "November is coming!" as they demonstrated in the Senate corridor, as the Republicans in control of the Senate Judiciary Committee chose to continue advancing Kavanaugh's nomination, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blazy Ford, according to Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation levels will break new records", said Stu Rottenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst.
People say they've been tall; they're right.
But they can be higher, especially among the female voter turnout in the suburbs and among younger voters, ages 18 to 29, who, despite their dislike of the president, often abstain from voting.
Even before Ford's public testimony, which exposed her allegations of sexual assault by the Supreme Court nominee, analysts argued that a backlash would be possible if the Republicans continued to push for the confirmation of the nomination.
"The nomination has put Republicans in a serious bind", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, NBC News reported.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Cuano gets the nomination, but also about how the Republicans handled it and how they handled it", said Giss Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats elect.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided on the degree of trust in the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with slightly higher support for Ford.
A recent YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents said they strongly or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they strongly or probably believed Quano's.
Also, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh had either definitely or probably lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford as well as allegations made by at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her while drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez claims the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals to her during a party they attended as Yale students in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Web to take on Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a start-up company with the goal of competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of the man who has become a legend in the tech world, is a company that will develop Solid, the open-source platform of Berners-Lee.
The Solid platform allows its users to choose where their data will be stored and who will be granted access to the different data types.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now", he said about the start-up.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create a "personal online database" or POD.
The repository could include a list of contacts, lists of tasks to be performed, a timetable, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
Imagine if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in one browser at the same time.
What makes the personal online database unique is that it is the user alone who decides who can access the information and what kind of information can be accessed.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
According to John Bruce, the company's CEO, the intention is that Inrupt will find the right resources, process and capabilities to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
Today the company includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, a team of developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer codebloggers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not in discussions with Facebook and Google about whether or not to implement a complete change that would completely and overnight transform all of their business models.
We don't ask their permission.
In a post published on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and environmental systems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network being built at Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the face of the Internet when he founded the Web standards organization, the W3C, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will continue to serve as founder and director of the W3C, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I am especially optimistic about the next era of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: A ceremony to commemorate the Victorian Cross winner of World War I
The only Anglican clergyman to be awarded the Victoria Cross as a soldier during the First World War was commemorated in his home town, 100 years after the victory.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Van, was awarded the Victoria Cross on 29 September 1918 for his part in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the highest British decoration.
The memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Northampton on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said that the unveiling of the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the Order of Merit is "remarkably symbolic".
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-General Vaughan led his battalion across the St. Kentin's Channel "through heavy fog and under heavy fire from armed units and machine guns".
He then rushed to the line of fire and with great gallantry led the line forward before rushing to take possession of a submachine gun in one hand and cutting down three of the company.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - one month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were something that I know I could never match but something that humbled me.
He and his brother, Dr James Van, also put on a stranger after the parade, led by the Royal Brentwood Youth Orchestra.
Michael Van said he was "very honored to be part of the parade" and added "the courage of a true hero is shown in the support given to so many people".
Mixed martial arts fans stayed up all night to watch Blattor 206 and instead got Peppa Pig.
Imagine staying up all night to watch the action of Baltor 206 and eventually being denied access to the main event.
The San Jose show featured 13 fights, including six on the main card, and was shown live overnight on Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6am, just as Jaggard Musasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for battle, the British spectators were left stunned when the score was changed to a pappy pig.
Some of them were not impressed by the change after staying up until the very early hours of the morning to watch the fight.
One fan described on Twitter the transition to the children's cartoon as "a kind of sick joke".
"It's a government rule that at 6 a.m. the original content was inappropriate and so they had to switch to kids' programs", Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and media at Blatter, said when asked about the broadcast.
- I'm not going to.
The president of the Blatter Company, Scott Cocker, said they intend to work on their timetables to include future British viewers.
"I think that when I think about the feedback, I think we can probably solve this", said Cocker.
But it's 6:00 a.m. on a Sunday there, and we won't be able to solve the problem until the Sunday in our time zone, which is the Sunday in their time zone.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, during the transition, there were a lot of text messages exchanged between the two sides, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, thought it was a technical glitch.
But no, it was a government problem.
I can assure you that next time it's not going to happen.
We're only gonna have five fights instead of six, like we usually do. We tried to give the fans more and just overreacted.
It's a matter of bad luck.
Tom Daley was sensitive about his sexual orientation.
Tom Daley, the Olympic water skier, said that as a young man he felt inferior to everyone else because of his sexual orientation -- but that feeling motivated him to become a success.
The 24-year-old jumper said he didn't know until he was in junior high that not everyone was like me.
In an interview on Channel 4's Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren LaVerne, he said he spoke out on gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that being a hero made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
Our regular anchor of the veteran show, Christy Young, has taken a few months' sick leave.
In his first appearance as the star of the show Laverne, Daley said he felt "underrated" as a child because it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls.
He said, "Until today, the feeling of belonging, the feeling of being different, were real things that gave me the power and the strength and allowed me to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was "something", he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when they finally found out what his sexual orientation was.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a vocal campaigner for the LGBT community and used his participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to legalise homosexuality.
He spoke out about it because he felt lucky to be given the opportunity to live openly and without consequences and wanted to give others hope.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with the man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013, "took me by surprise".
Daley married the Oscar winner, 20 years his senior, last year, but he said the age gap was never an issue.
"When you're going through so much at such a young age" -- he first competed in the Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was hard to find anyone his age who had experienced such highs and lows.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Dailey, and Dailey said that his whole outlook changed.
If you asked me last year, it was all about "I need to win the gold medal", he said.
You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is a ruby.
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daily said that his father couldn't accept the fact that he was dying and that one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets to the London 2012 Olympics because he wanted to be in the front row.
I couldn't tell him you wouldn't be here to be front row, Dad, he said.
"I held his hand while his breathing stopped and only when he stopped breathing and died did I finally know that he was not invincible", he said.
A year later, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won an ARD medal.
I just knew that this was what I dreamed of my whole life - to perform in front of my home crowd at the Olympic Games, it was the best feeling ever, he said.
It's also what inspired him to choose his first song - Proud by The Small Crop - which he identified with during the run-up to the Olympics and still makes him duck-skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 British Summer Time.
Michaelson was a disappointment in his performance and went down on the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American golfer Phil Michaelson will set a new record on Sunday when he plays in the 47th Ryder Cup, but he will need to improve his performance to prevent the event from turning into a miserable milestone.
Michaelson, who is entering the doubles event for the 12th time and setting a record, was disqualified by decision of Jim Furyk during the foursomes and foursomes matches on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the action, as is customary in games with the U.S. National Team, Michaelson, who has won five Major Tournaments, spent half the day as a cheerleader and the other half working on his game on the sidelines in hopes of correcting the sickness he was suffering.
Even at the peak of his career, the player's performance has suffered from ups and downs. Therefore, the 48-year-old Michaelson is not the ideal choice for the women's golfing world, where the long grass courses are usually not forgiving of blunt punches.
And if the competition itself wasn't intimidating enough, Michaelson, in Game 9 on Sunday, faced off against the British accurate champion, Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood and won all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, who have lost four points in the first 12 games of the season, were to succeed in the early stages, Michelson's play could be decisive.
Fioric expressed confidence in his player, though we didn't expect him to say anything else.
"He understood his role perfectly today, patted me on the back, put his arm around me and said he'd be ready tomorrow", said Furyk.
He has a lot of confidence.
He's a Hall of Famer and he's added a lot to these selections in the past, and this week.
I guess I didn't expect him to play two games.
I expected more, but that's how it turned out and that's how we thought we should go.
He wanted to be on the track, just like all the other players.
Michaelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It may be the end of his Ryder Cup career, which never really matched his personal highs.
Michaelson has a record of 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Fioric said his presence added some intangible benefits to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, he's funny, he likes to make people laugh, and it's fun to be in the dressing room with him", he explained.
I think the younger players also had fun with him this week, and it was nice to see that.
It's a lot more than just the game itself.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great advantage may soon be lost
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead before the final day of the Ryder Cup's only games could turn for the worse.
The Danish player started his career at Waldrama in 1997, when his teammate, Grandpa Blastros, had a five-point lead over the Americans, which he lost when he nearly crossed the finish line with a narrow lead and won 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"I keep reminding myself that we had a big lead in Waldrama; we had a big lead in the Brooklyn game, where we lost, and a big lead in the Waldrama game, where we won but with a small lead", said Bjorn, pictured, after watching the 5-3 victory in the 2018 Tournament both on Friday and Sunday, which led to a 10-6 lead at the National Golf League.
Then history will prove to me and everyone on the team that it's not over.
We have to give it all away tomorrow.
Got to get on track and do all the right things.
It's not over until the dots aren't on the board.
We have a goal, to try and win the Cup, and we need to focus on that.
I said all along, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're very aware of those on the other side - the best players in the world.
Bjorn was pleased with his players' performance on the difficult golf course and added: "I think I should never be too early when it comes to golf.
Tomorrow could be completely different.
Tomorrow, the focus will be on personal performance, and that's completely different.
It's a pleasure to be on the course when everything is going well, but when you're out there on your own, then your full potential as a golfer is put to the test.
And that's the message to the players: You have to do your best tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner behind and he has to make the best of himself, too.
Unlike Bourne, opposing captain Jim Furyk would expect better individual performances from his players, compared to their performances in the doubles, except for Gordon Spitzer and Justin Thomas, who earned three points out of four.
Fioric himself knows both the winning and losing sides during the important closing days of these tournaments, having participated in the winning team in Brooklyn before losing, when the European team managed to win the final game in a miraculous way, as documented in the film Miracle at Medinah.
"I remember every word", he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, encouraged his players on the final day.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but I want to make it through the early stages, like you saw in Brooklyn, and like you saw in Medinah.
When that momentum moves to one side, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfielders.
We're gonna set up our lineup accordingly and put the guys on the track based on the feeling that we have, you know, we're trying to do magic tomorrow.
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the fight and he will face Rory McIlroy in the summit match, with Paul Cassay, Justin Rose, John Ramm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, who are the rest of the Europeans in the top half of the standings.
"I chose the cast in this series because I think he's going to bring us to the end", Bjorn said of his casting.
The acceptance of Germany's new warship has been refused once again.
Germany's new navy frigate was supposed to be accepted in 2014 to replace its aging Cold War-era warships, but it was delayed by at least a year, due to damaged systems and declining costs, local media reported.
The delivery of Rheinland-Pfalz, the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate line, has now been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quoted a military spokesman.
The vessel was due to join the fleet in 2014, but troubling after-supply issues have put a damper on the ambitious project.
All four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships, ordered by the Navy back in 2007, will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
They are expected to include a high-powered cannon, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missile batteries as well as stealth technologies such as acoustic signals, infrared and radar attenuation.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it will be possible to deploy the newest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
However, repeated delays mean that the new ships - which are meant to allow Germany to send troops overseas - will be obsolete by the time they enter service, de Paet noted.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy formally refused to accept the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had brought back a ship to build ships after it was decommissioned.
Not much is known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media cited a number of critical software and hardware flaws that rendered the warship useless for use in a combat mission.
The shortcomings of the program were especially important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships would be operated by about 120 sailors - about half the crew of the older Bremen class frigates.
Additionally, it was found that the ship had a dramatic overweight that was reducing its performance and limiting the Navy's ability to add upgrades in the future.
The Rheinland-Pfalz weighs 7,000 tons, twice as much as the similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Besides the flawed software, the price tag of the entire project - including the training of the staff - also becomes a problem.
It reportedly reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) - over the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems that are plaguing the newest frigates are becoming especially serious in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's security committee, confirmed that the navy now has ships capable of carrying out deployments.
The official source said the problem had accelerated and intensified over time as old ships were taken out of service but not replaced by other vessels.
He regretted that no Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate could be added to the navy.
The National Trust for Scotland is listening to the secret lives of bats
A new study at a farm in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to hunt their food.
The hope is that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, which is being carried out by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow European bats and teleots, as well as the brown and long-eared Dubbontons at Inbriou Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile scans using handheld detectors.
An expert voice analysis of all the recordings will determine the frequencies of the bats' calls and which species is responsible for them.
Next, the habitat map is plotted to create a detailed, landscape-scale picture of their behavior patterns.
Rob Dover, a conservation consultant for the National Trust for Scotland (NTS) hopes the results will reveal which habitats are most important to the vultures and how each of the species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as creating nesting colonies and how best to preserve forest areas for bats and other related species.
The bat populations in Scotland and across Britain have declined dramatically over the last century.
They are under threat from development and construction, which is affecting nesting and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, and this is true of fly traps and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by house cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, bats' ears are more useful when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated technique of echo-tracking to locate insects and identify obstacles to their flight path.
The NTS Foundation, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 760,000 acres of land throughout the country, takes the plaques very seriously.
It has 10 trained specialists, who regularly conduct surveys, incubation tests and sometimes rescues.
The organisation also established the first and only bat reserve at the Tribute Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The estate manager, David Thompson, said the estate was the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Trieste we have a great area for bats", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the appropriate living areas.
But there's still a lot that's unknown about bats, so the work we're doing here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive.
He stressed the importance of testing for the presence of the bats before any maintenance work is done on the property, as the accidental destruction of a single nest can kill up to 400 females and cubs, and potentially destroy an entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and killing, harassing and disturbing bats or destroying their nesting areas is prohibited by law.
Elizabeth Pearl, a Scottish trustee of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to give a helping hand.
She said, "We have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we just don't know what their population status is".
Ronaldo is dropping the rape charges while the lawyers prepare to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations against him "fake news", and said that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news magazine "Der Spiegel", which published the allegations.
Portugal international footballer, Viventos, is accused of raping an American woman, Catherine Myorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
The suspect allegedly subsequently paid her $375,000 to keep her silent about the incident, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
Ronaldo, 33, addressed his 142 million Instagram followers in a live video hours after the allegations were published, disparagingly calling the reports "fake news".
- No, no, no, no. - What are you doing?
What they said yesterday, Fake News, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
They want to promote themselves using my name.
It's only natural.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the job.
"I'm a happy man and all is well", the actor added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Dr. Spiegel over the allegations, which they have described as "unacceptable reporting of privacy concerns", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for the moral damage in an amount commensurate with the severity of the violation, which is arguably one of the most serious violations of individual rights in recent years.
The alleged incident allegedly took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Morga reportedly returned to the actor's room and the actor allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Miorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and told her he was a "99 percent good guy" who had failed her in "one percent".
The documents say that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Myrga also claims that she contacted the police and had photos of her injuries taken at the hospital, but that she later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "intimidated by acts of revenge" and feared "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says she now wishes to cancel the arrangement as she is still suffering from trauma from the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and moved to Italian club Juventus in the summer for a deal worth €100 million.
Brexit: Britain regrets the loss of its car manufacturers
Britain will regret forever if it loses its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, its business minister, Greg Clarke, has said.
He added that Toyota's interview with the BBC, in which it said that if Britain left the EU without a deal it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Burntiston, near Derby, was "mad as hell".
"We need an agreement", said Clark.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The factory in Branson - which makes the Oris and the Toyota Avance - produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, 90 percent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"From my point of view, if the UK leaves the EU without a deal at the end of March, we will see a production shutdown at our plant", said Marvin Cook, Toyota's chief executive in Branson.
Other UK car manufacturers have raised concerns about leaving the European Union without a deal and how it would affect cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its car plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what vehicle manufacturers call "supply chain risks" in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The Toyota production line is run on a 'just in time' basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes, from British and other EU suppliers, to manufacture cars on order.
If the UK leaves the European Union without a deal on March 29th, there could be disruption at the border, and industry insiders say that could lead to delays and a shortage of parts.
Toyota won't be able to keep more than a day's worth of inventory at the Derbyshire plant, the company says, so production will be shut down.
Clarke said that May's "Crackers Plan", which outlines Britain's future relationship with the European Union, was designed precisely to prevent such checks at the border.
"We need to reach an agreement. We want to reach the best possible agreement, as I said, not just to enjoy the success of the present, but to seize the opportunity", he said on the Today programme on BBC Radio 4.
"The evidence from Toyota and other car manufacturers is that being able to continue to use the successful supply chain that we have today is absolutely critical".
Toyota didn't say how long the shutdown would last, but in the longer term, it warned that the cost overruns would hurt the plant's competitiveness and eventually lead to layoffs.
Peter Covalarris, who has worked at Barnaston for 24 years and serves as the union president of Unite at the plant, said union members are increasingly concerned: "My mission is that if jobs are lost, they will never be restored.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be pushed back again, White House says
Donald Trump's meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, on which much depends, may be delayed for another week as the battle for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and possible interference with the president's investigative processes.
The rumours in Washington have been going on for months about whether Trump would fire the deputy attorney general and risk Mueller's independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a wire to record Trump's conversations and to cause the president's impeachment via the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Friday, he arrived at the White House, and according to reports, he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was set for the 8th with Trump, which was delayed by the arrival of Rosenstein at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein, but at this point the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blaise Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, and again postponed the Senate vote.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
In response to a question about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "We have not set a date for the meeting yet, it may be held this week, I can see a postponement for another week given what is happening in the Supreme Court".
But we'll see and I'm always happy to update the press.
Some reporters will appeal this ruling: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked the host why.
Sanders said the rarity of the briefings did not stem from dislike of the TV writers' position, though she said: "I will not deny the fact that they are taking a position".
She then suggested increasing direct contact between Trump and the press.
"The president has more Q&A meetings than any president before him", she said, adding without citing evidence, "We've looked at the numbers".
Press conferences will still be held, Sanders said, but if the press has the opportunity to put questions directly to the president of the United States, that's much better than talking to me.
We've tried to do that on many occasions, and you've seen that we've done it on many occasions in the last few weeks, and meetings that allow us to talk to the president of the United States will replace the press briefings.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends open meetings or press conferences during high-profile visits.
His press-only parties are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, in a loose and sometimes bizarre performance in front of a packed press.
A health worker writes to EU staff at NHS Scotland and addresses concerns about Brexit
The Health Service has written to the staff of the EU staff employed in the Scottish National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and ask that they remain after Brexit.
Scottish MP, Jane Freeman, sent a letter less than six months before Britain's exit from the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed to meeting the cost of permanent status applications for EU citizens working in its fragmented public services.
Ms Freeman wrote in her letter: "Throughout the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the exit continued, and it is progressing towards the decisions expected in the autumn.
But the British government has also increased its preparedness for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this period can be very worrying for all of you.
So I wanted to come back and say how much I appreciate the contribution of each of the members of the crew, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and the world bring invaluable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is undoubtedly your home and we would very much like you to stay here.
Christian Abercombe is undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
University of Tennessee Tigers running back Christian Abercombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury from Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Commodores at Vanderbilt University, reported Mike Organ of the Tennessean.
Rod Reed, the head coach of the University of Tennessee football team, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
He went to the edge of the field and just collapsed there, Reed said.
The coaches and medical staff gave Arcombi oxygen at the edge of the court and then lifted him onto a gurney and took him for further examination.
An official from the University of Tennessee told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Barcomb was being operated on at the Wonderblit Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet on the type/scope of the surgery" and that the University of Tennessee is still trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercombe is a student athlete and this is his first season with the University of Tennessee after transferring from Illinois.
He made five total tackles before being sidelined, bringing his total this season to 18.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying property in Britain and the extra income will be used to help the homeless, under the new Conservative plan.
The move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's move to attract new voters.
The stamp duty will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in Britain.
The Treasury expects the tax to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher rate of stamp duty when buying property in the UK - the extra income will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move was seen as an attempt to counter Jeremy Corbyn's ongoing success in attracting younger voters, with promises to provide cheaper housing and to target higher-income earners.
Stamp duty will be levied on people and companies who don't pay UK taxes, and the extra revenue will bolster the government's move to help the elderly in difficult circumstances.
The payment, which comes in addition to the current stamp duty, includes higher tax rates on secondary residences and on rental property investments - potentially as high as three percent.
The Treasury expects the march to raise up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of new properties being built in London are bought by foreign residents, a situation that has driven up prices and made it difficult for first-time homebuyers to gain a foothold in the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country - especially the capital - have become ghost towns because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in the stamp duty to help young people buy their first homes.
He blamed large property developers for the high property prices they were paying, for seizing land but not using it, and urged May to abandon the tariffs on affordable housing and fix Britain's housing bubble.
Corbyn announced a series of attractive housing reforms including rent control and the end of "no-fault" evictions.
He also wants to give councils more power to build new homes.
May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my term to restoring the British dream - the main one being that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not fair that non-British residents, and companies whose headquarters are in foreign countries, should be able to buy homes as easily as hard-working British residents.
The dream of home ownership has become too far for too many people, and the degradation of sleeping in harsh conditions is too real.
G.R.: My ultimate ambition is to run Scotland.
Sunderland manager Jack Ross has said his ultimate ambition is to become Scotland manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is relishing the challenge of reviving North East, who are currently in third place in League One, three points clear of the top of the table.
He moved to the Stadium of Light in the summer after leading St Mirren back to first place in Scotland last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I played one international game and that's it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But growing up, watching the Scotland team play at Hampden, a lot with my dad as a kid, and that was always something that drew me back.
Anyway, this opportunity will only come if I manage the team.
Previous directors of Sunderland have included Dick Adduct, David Moise, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kean, Gus Fuya, and Paolo Di Canio.
The former manager of Eloah Athletic says he was not afraid to reach out to such established names at such a big club, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
For me, success right now is measured by whether I can get this club back in the Premier League.
Because of the structure and facilities of this club, there's no doubt it belongs in the Premier League, he said.
It's not an easy task to get him there, but I can only see myself as a success story here if I can get the club back there.
Ross only started his managerial career three years ago, after a stint as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months as Hearts' first team coach.
He then helped Alaouita get out of the Second Division and lift St Mirren out of the bottom half of the table to the Championship the following season.
And Ross says he's more comfortable than he's ever been during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Milton Academical.
It was probably a coincidence, he remembered, that he had taken command of the Aloha.
I really believed that the management position suited me better than the game.
It sounds weird because I've been playing well, I've been making a reasonable profit, and I've enjoyed some reasonable records.
But an actor's career can be tough.
There's a lot of stuff you have to deal with every week.
I'm still dealing with all the stress and pressure at work, but management just feels right.
I always wanted to manage and now I'm doing it, and I've never felt more comfortable with myself as an adult.
You can listen to the full interview on Sportsound, Sunday, September 30th, on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 British Summer Time.
The perfect time to have a pint of beer is 5:30 on a Saturday, according to a survey.
The summer heat wave has boosted the profits of Britain's struggling pubs, but has put pressure on the restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups enjoyed a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July - but restaurant revenues fell 4.8 percent, the data revealed.
Peter Martin, of the business consultancy CGA, which compiled the data, said: "The persistence of the clear weather and England's longer-than-expected World Cup run mean that July saw a similar pattern to June, with pubs' revenues rising by 2.8 percent, but restaurants were hit even harder.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant sales in June only intensified in July.
Pubs and bars focusing on drinks recorded the strongest performance, with a higher growth in revenue decline in restaurant business, compared to the previous period.
Food-oriented pubs also suffered from the sun, although their situation was less dramatic than that of restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
Among pub and bar chains, beverage sales rose 6.6 percent during the month, and food sales dropped 3 percent.
Paul Newman, of RSM, a company that analyzes entertainment and hospitality data, said: "These results continue the trend we've seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major sporting or social events are the most important factors when it comes to the outdoor market.
It's no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, though a 4.8 percent drop in sales compared to last year will be particularly painful in addition to all of the fixed costs.
The long, hot summer couldn't have come at a worse time for food-focused businesses, and time will tell if the milder temperatures we experienced in August will bring the relief they so desperately need.
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, stood at 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand launches.

One in five kids has social media accounts that they hide from their parents
A survey revealed that one in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed an increase in fake Instagram pages.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content
20 percent of the students said they have a "head account" that they show to their parents.
One in five children -- some as young as 11 -- create social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in fake Instagram accounts -- as a reminder of the photo-sharing site, Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they run a clean account to show their parents, but they also have private accounts.
A mother who stumbled upon her teenage daughter's secret account found herself asking others to rape me.
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC of UK independent schools, found that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles and half of them admit to having private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "I'm concerned that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them".
Ailid Doyle will serve as the Athletes' Spokesperson on the Scottish Athletes' Board.
Ailide Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletes' Board as an external director at the annual general meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in track and field and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a wonderful opportunity for those who guide the sport to benefit from her decades of experience at the international level over the past decade.
"Ailid has been highly regarded by the Scottish, British and international athletic community and we are confident that Scottish athletes will benefit immensely from her appointment to the board", Beatty said.
Doyle said: "I'm excited to serve as a voice for athletes and hope that I can contribute and really help guide the sport in Scotland".
The American, who won the 200- and 400-meter races at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, and four Olympic gold medals in all, and who now regularly serves as a commentator on the BBC network, lost his ability to walk after suffering a transient stroke.
He tweeted: "A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time would tell if or how much I'd recover.
It was a sluggish job, but I've made a full recovery, I've re-learned how to walk and now I'm doing agile and responsive exercises!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!
Advertising for milk pumps matching mother cows online opinion party
A milk pump company has sparked online controversy with an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers to cow milking.
To mark the launch of what is supposed to be the world's first "quiet, wearable milk pump", consumer technology company Elvie released a humorous video ad to demonstrate the freedom of action the new pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled cow barn to the tune of a song that includes words like, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you can't see a tail", and "In case you haven't noticed, it's not my tits, it's my tits".
The chorus goes on and says, "Sug, suck, I feed the babies, suck, suck, I suck my girls".
But the ad, posted on the company's Facebook page, caused a stir on the network.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it sheds light on the horrors of the dairy industry.
It's a very bad decision to use cows to promote the product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are stolen from them within days of hatching.
Elvie's milk pump is integrated discreetly into the breast (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment said, "Obviously traumatized a cow and a calf alike".
But hey, why not use them to advertise a milk pump to mothers who are leaving to keep their babies?
Another comment said, "Averted completely".
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting she thought the song was "laughing".
I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
The suction made me feel just like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I was referring to its content.
It's a genius product, someone wrote.
Another comment said: This is a funny ad for mothers who are sucking (often in their workplaces or in the bathroom) and feel like monkeys.
This is not an ad that praises or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the group of women discover that they've all danced with the discrete pumps inside their bras.
The idea behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who use a milk pump say they feel like cows.
But Elvie's pump is completely silent, no tubes and no wires, it is discreetly integrated into the breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move around, hold their babies, and even get out while sucking.
Anna Bellarine, partner and head of the Early Childhood Development department at Mother, noted: "Elvie's pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By creating the analogy between self-expressing women and cow-pulling, we wanted to put the milk pump and all its challenges in the spotlight, and demonstrate in a fun, relatable way, the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will provide.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two walked the runway for fashion designer Martha Jakubovsky using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were quietly moved to a tented camp on the Texas border.
The number of immigrant children in detention has soared even though the monthly number of border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, and one reason for this is that the Trump administration's lobbying and policies have made it difficult to transfer children to foster care.
Typically, most sponsors were undocumented immigrants themselves, and they were afraid to jeopardize their ability to stay in the country by applying for child custody.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced potential foster children and other adult households would be required to submit fingerprints, and those children would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albenz, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for unaccompanied minor sponsorship.
The Authority later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had no previous criminal history.
Nearly 80 percent of the foster parents or their foster children are in the country illegally, and a large number of them are criminals from foreign countries.
That's why we keep chasing these people, Mr. Albans said.
In an effort to address the children's issues more quickly, officials introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of their arrest, instead of the 60 days previously required, shelter workers reported.
Many will appear via video conference call, rather than face-to-face, to present their arguments for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those who are not found eligible for release will be deported immediately.
The longer these children are in foster care, the more likely they are to develop anxiety and depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, shelter workers and reports from the system have said in recent months.
Counselors say these fears are exacerbated by larger facilities like the Torneiro, where signs of a child's distress are likely to be ignored, given the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to the tent city without giving them enough time to emotionally prepare or say goodbye to friends, could exacerbate the trauma many are already dealing with.
Syria tells US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mouhammad also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Mouallem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext that they are fighting terrorism, and will be treated accordingly.
They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally, he said to the rally.
Moallem argued that the war on terror is almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been displaced.
He said Damascus would continue to fight this holy battle until it cleansed the Syrian lands of terrorist organizations and any illegal foreign presence as such.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and advising Kurdish and Syrian forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 fighters on the ground in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Mouallem said that the conditions for their return are good and blamed certain Western countries for "spreading irrational fears" that have prompted refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to help bring them back", he said.
They're politicizing an issue that should be purely humanitarian.
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not send aid to rebuild Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold, has created an opportunity for political negotiations to move forward.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a full-scale attack by Syrian forces backed by the Russians on the province, which is home to three million people.
However, Mouallem stressed that the agreement had "clear termination dates" and expressed hope that the military action would focus on jihadists, including fighters from the Victory Front affiliated with al-Qaeda, who would be destroyed.
The UN envoy, Stéphane de Mistura, hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee, composed of members of the government and opposition, to draft a post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
M'alem set conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee and said that the panel's work should be limited to "examination of the articles of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
By this logic, Trump will win reelection in 2020, unless, as many liberal observers are hoping, the impeachment scandal ends his presidency prematurely.
In what will undoubtedly be the most dramatic closing episode in the history of the presidency.
At this time, there are no signs of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, prime-time viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million viewers on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million viewers on MSNBC.
Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers at peak hours, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the MSNBC-broadcast Rachel Maddow show topped cable ratings with up to 3.5 million viewers on prime time.
"It's the illusion that people are drawn to because it's not something that we understand", said Neil Barr, executive producer of the ABC drama series, The Enforced Killer, which is about a secretary of state who becomes president after an attack destroys the capital.
Len Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author who only writes the funny parts and some hard truths about infiltrating the male Hollywood community has a different theory.
She remembers taking a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he voted for Trump.
Why? She asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh", Mrs. Scovel told me.
Chaos has value in entertainment.
Of course, unlike all other TV shows, storylines coming out of Washington could determine the fate of the case of Weah v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
Changing channels or skipping them are luxuries that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you are going beyond the bounds of being a responsible citizen when you find yourself watching for six hours on a panel of Danish experts the use of Bob Woodward's classified media as the source of Paul Manafort's "Fear", the $15,000 bomber jacket and the aftermath of Stormi Daniels's gruesome portrayal of, and pardon for, Trump's anatomy.
I, for one, will never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
"Part of what he does, which feels like a reality show, is he feeds you something every night", said Bert Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the show "History for Sale", about the Trump show's rotating cast and the daily twists and turns (war with the NFL, praise for Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss one episode or be left behind.
When I arrived at Mr. Place this week, it was bright outside with a temperature of about 85 degrees on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was locked out to watch MSNBC, and he was recording CNN in parallel.
He couldn't get off, not when Brett Kavanaugh was preparing to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hangs in the balance.
"I remember the times when we did all these crazy shows before and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Place told me.
I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right.

Outside funding is flooding the race for the midterm elections.
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th district is facing a flood of money, thanks to the reorganization of congressional districts, which has resulted in two members of Congress running for the same seat.
The district, a suburb of Pittsburgh whose boundaries were recently redrawn, puts Democratic Rep. Connor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring - in the lead.
Lamb ran against another congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's 12th district, which largely overlaps with the boundaries of the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the previous county division had unconstitutionally skewed the results in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a financial battle in the campaign between the financial arms of the major parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after winning a close special election in March, which garnered wide viewership, for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat had been held by Republicans for over a decade, and President Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political analysts predicted a soft lead for the Democrats.
The U.S. considered punishing El Salvador for its support of China, and then backed off.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already met in Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Trump had a heated meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varla in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until his associates fired the Trump Company's management team.
State Department officials have decided to repatriate the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in response to recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But the sanctions were weighed only against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in aid from the US in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in economic aid and targeted restrictions on visas, could have hurt the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, officials from North and Central America rejected an emergency conference that was supposed to focus on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar conference last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from reaching the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made clear their willingness to advance the convention, thus ending any consideration of punishing El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now expected to address the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, as a symbol of the importance the administration attaches to it, diplomats said.
And three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any messages or new harsh punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman, acting on Bolton's behalf, declined to comment on the details of the meeting as described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to speak on internal matters, on condition of anonymity.
Their accounts were corroborated by an outside analyst, close to the administration, who also spoke anonymously.
Learning the history
The obvious next thing may come from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on the alleged disruption of Trump's investigative procedures, for which there is now significant evidence in the public record.
Mueller is reportedly directing his investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia in its attacks on our campaign.
If control of Congress shifts, Trump will find himself holding this body accountable, just as he prepares to face the voters again, and perhaps a jury.
There are a lot of questions that start with "who?" and I'm not going to argue that Trump's downfall is inevitable -- nor is it inevitable for his European counterpart.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we all have to make choices that will affect the length of time that this struggle can last.
In 1938, German officers were willing to carry out a coup against Hitler, if only the West would oppose him and support the Munich talks.
We failed, and we missed an opportunity to prevent the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and the march of democracy that cannot be stopped is accelerated or slowed.
Americans are now facing several such tipping points.
What if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this newspaper reported last year that he offered to secretly tape the president and raised speculation about his unsuitability for the presidency.
Rosenstein said the Times report was inaccurate.
How would we react if the F.B.I. investigation into Bert Kavanaugh, which was recently requested, is not complete or fair - or if his nomination to the Supreme Court is upheld despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections and appoint a Congress that will put Trump in charge?
If we fail these tests, democracy will enter a long hibernation.
But I believe we will not fail, because of the lesson we learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, who had also previously confiscated my lavish home.
She survived, immigrated to America and 60 years later, sent me to light candles on Saturday at the same table that held the swastika.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?
Norman Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is the chairman of the nonprofit organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the author of "The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House".
Graham Durrance of the Rangers is optimistic about the conflict in Rapid Vienna.
The Rangers host Rapid Vienna on the 30th, and know that a win over the Austrians, after their impressive draw against Virial in Spain earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury kept Graham Durrance from making his first appearance of the season until a 2-2 draw with Viarell, but he believes the Rangers could use this result as a springboard for better performance.
"It was a good point for us because Virial is a good team", said the 31-year-old footballer.
We went into the game believing we could get something and we got a point.
We might have won in the end, but, all in all, a draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came out of the freeze in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday will be another big European night.
I hope we can get the three points but it's going to be a tough game because they got a good result in their last game, but with the crowd behind us, I'm convinced we can push and get a positive result.
The last year has been really tough, with everything that's happened with my injuries and the changes to the club itself, but there's a good feeling about the place now.
The team is good and the guys are really enjoying it; the training is good.
I hope we can move on now, put the last season behind us and make it.
Women stay up because of this fear about pension savings.
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked about it with their families.
About half of the respondents in the Nationwide survey said they talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take steps to conduct the conversation", said Holly Schneider, vice president of Nationwide Life Insurance Company.
You can do it the following way.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for treatment if you do not express your wishes well in advance.
Use your counselor and family to discuss where and how to get treatment, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining cost.
Share your financial advisor: The advisor can also help you find a way to pay for the expenses.
Your financing options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term life insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with a cash amount to help cover expenses, or self-insurance with your own capital - as long as you have the money.
Prepare your legal papers: Find an early resolution to legal battles on this occasion.
Find and assign a health care representative, a trusted person who will oversee your medical care and make sure that the professionals fulfill your wishes in the event that you are unable to communicate.
Consider also signing a power of attorney for your money.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and guarantee payment of bills if you are unable to do so.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications or allergies?
We've included these details in a written plan to be prepared.
"The financial side is not the only important point, but also who the doctors are".

A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle at Ilpercomb.
A man was shot several times with a hail of air as he walked home from a night out.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of the Ilpercombe in Devon when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police described the shooting, which occurred at approximately 2:30 a.m. British Summer Time, as an accidental incident.
The victim never saw the person who attacked him.
The injuries he sustained are not life-threatening and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palo, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
The disaster caused a breakdown in communications networks and the official bodies in charge of aid could not get information from the Dongalle district, an area in North Palo that was closer to the source of the 7.5 quake itself.
In Palo, over 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some facts about Palo and Dongola on Sulawesi:
Palo is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city marked its 40th anniversary when the tsunami wave and earthquake hit.
Donggala is a district that stretches over 300 km (180 mi) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi.
The population of the district, an administrative area within the province, was estimated at 299,200 in 2017.
The main sources of income in the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi are fishing and agriculture, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Another important source of income is the nickel mining, which is concentrated mainly in Muravali, on the coast opposite Sulawesi.
Palo and Dongola have been hit several times by tsunami waves in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami wave also hit western Dongola in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, known for its seismic activity and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake off the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami wave that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, with more than half of the deaths occurring in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island and caused a tsunami wave that broke off the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Pudong, the capital of West Sumatra province.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 earthquake itself struck one of the Mentawai Islands, off Sumatra, and caused a tsunami wave as high as 10 meters, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the Fide Ghaya district of Aceh, causing devastation and panic as the locals recalled the devastation following the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
The earthquake didn't cause a tsunami in this case, but over 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, killing over 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily abandoned thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested for domestic violence.
Truck Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska and vice presidential candidate, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, disruption of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to a police report, when Merina tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone away.
Palin is being held in the Mat-Su Petrial Detention Facility on $500 self-deposit, according to a report by KTUU TV.
According to online reports, he appeared in court on Saturday, and declared himself "not guilty, by all means", when asked to retract his claims.
Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, and therefore, faces up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He's also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which carries a penalty of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time criminal charges have been brought against Failin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report an alleged assault.
The case is currently before the Alaska Court of Appeals.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of report of a crime of domestic violence, and possession of a weapon under the influence in connection with an incident.
His girlfriend claimed he punched her in the face.
Retired Army soldiers groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from his service in Iraq.
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds Killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communication networks are down, and the casualty rate is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck near the centre of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos, circulating on social media, show the moment of the injury.
Hundreds of people gathered to celebrate the beach festival in the city of Palo when the tsunami wave hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people - a rare sentence not carried out for a federal crime in the country since 1953.
The 30-year-old Seipov allegedly used a rented Hum Defoe truck to carry out a bicycle ramp attack along the West Side Highway in southern Manhattan, crushing pedestrians and cyclists who had been in his path in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saypov deliberately killed eight victims and deliberately inflicted serious bodily injury, according to a statement of intent for the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, the death penalty can be sought on both of these charges.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury struck Seipov with a 22-count indictment, including eight counts of murder by extortion, which is commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "significant advance planning and premeditation", the prosecutors said, describing the way in which Seipov carried out the attack as "vile, cruel and morbid".
"Sypob has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Daigo Enrique Angellini, Nicolas Klebs, Ann-Lor Dac, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlig, Hernan Prozzi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damien Panucci", the statement of intent said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last time the Southern District of New York filed a death penalty case was a decade ago.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been executed after being convicted of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Seipov, a native of Uzbekistan, expressed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about his actions, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
According to the police, he also asked to have a Daesh flag hung in the hospital room where he was staying.
He pleaded not guilty in response to the 22-count indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal prosecutors representing Seipov, said they were obviously disappointed by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a plea of guilty that would result in a life sentence without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved", Patton said.
Seipov's legal team has previously asked prosecutors not to pursue the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should be put in charge of the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage vowed to enlist the People's Army today during a protest at the Conservative convention.
The former UKIP leader said politicians must "feel the pressure" from Eurosceptics - as Theresa May's Conservative MP claimed he should be in charge of negotiating with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Boone said at a march in Birmingham that Britain "would already be out" at this point if Mr. Fraga had served as Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge facing May, to reconcile the highly divided conservative ranks, was highlighted by the joining of Remain Conservatives to a different anti-Brexit demonstration in the city.
The Prime Minister has struggled to keep her Brexit compromise on track despite attacks from Brexit supporters, Remainers and the EU.
The Allies insisted that she would continue to try and reach an agreement with Brussels despite the backlash - and force the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her deal and the rest of the world.
Boone said at the Leave Means Leave group meeting in Solihull that he wanted to "break up" with the Shakers.
He argued that Fraga should have been admitted as a member and be in charge of negotiating with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd be out by now", he said.
The MP for Wallingborough added: "I am for Brexit but we have to say goodbye to the Conservatives".
He emphasized his opposition to the European Union and said: "We did not fight in two world wars to be slaves.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Boone dismissed claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is completely false".
Conservative MP and Brexit supporter Andrea Genkins was also at the march and told reporters: "I'm simply saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people".
The Chequers plan is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and with our activists who will go out into the streets and elect us in the first place.
Please, put down the screws and start listening.
In a critical message to May, she added: "Government leaders keep their promises when they keep their promises".
Pragya said at the conference that politicians should be made to "feel the pressure" if they are going to betray the decision that was made in the 2016 referendum.
"It's now a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class", he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them you can't get away with it.
He added, in a message to the enthusiastic audience: "I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel stressed.
We call on the people of this country, who gave us the victory of Brexit and will never rest until we are an independent Britain, self-governing and proud.
At that moment, the Remainers marched in Birmingham and then held a two-hour conference in the city centre.
A handful of activists waved "Conservative" banners after the group's formation over the weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis made fun of the security problems the Conservatives have suffered with the party app.
"These are people who tell us they can have IT systems and all the technology to have a Canada Plus Plus deal, frictionless border crossing and borderless free trade in Ireland", he added.
This is completely ridiculous.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren plans to seriously consider running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's seriously considering running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democratic senator from Massachusetts spoke about her future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running in the November midterm elections against Republican Geoff Deal, who served as co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She was at the center of rumors that she might run against Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke, which took place on Saturday afternoon, is the 36th meeting with voters in the Town Hall format since Trump took office.
One of the attendees asked her if she was going to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for women to come to Washington to fix our broken government and for a woman to lead it.
Arrested in the shooting death of Sims from LSU
Police in the capital city of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced Saturday that the suspected shooter who killed LSU basketball player Wade Sims was arrested on Monday.
Baton Rouge Police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dayton Simpson during an 11 a.m. news conference at ET.
Police released a video of the shooting on Wednesday, asking for help identifying a man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed outside Southern University's campus early on Friday.
Wade Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually succumbed to his injuries, police Chief Murphy G. Paul told reporters Saturday, as reported by 247sports.
Wade tried to protect a friend and got shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being present when he had a gun and shot Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
The 6-foot-2 junior played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
The Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton finishes with a world title after the team standings gave him a win over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified for the next round ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes class would play a big part in the race.
But for the first time, Boots got off to a good start and left Hamilton almost alone as he defended his position for the first two rounds and invited Wattell to attack his team-mate.
Votel went to a stop first and let Hamilton blend in with the tail movement of the other competitors, a decision that was probably decisive.
The Mercedes team exited the pit stop later and returned to the race behind Wettel, but Hamilton moved forward after a tight wheel struggle that eventually forced the Ferrari driver to leave the inner track to hold out without risk after a double move into the third corner.
Max Verstappen, celebrating his 21st birthday, started from the back of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first lap.
He then led for much of the race and did not change tires to get a quick finish and round Kimmy Raykunden into fourth place.
He eventually dropped to a stop in the 44th round and was unable to pick up the pace for the remaining eight rounds as Shikonen took fourth place.
It's a tough day because Voltaire did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman when he let me pass him.
"The crew did an extraordinary job of getting to Dublin", said Hamilton.
That was some bad body language.
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally Saturday in connection with her insistence that she had not leaked a letter from Christine Blaise Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a conference in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the testimony given by Ford to the Senate Judiciary Committee, saying instead that what was happening in the Senate showed that people are "wicked and vicious and liars".
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see angry and evil and vicious and lying people", he said.
When you look at the publications and the leaks and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do that".
I didn't do that.
Remember that?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer... Did you leak the document?
Oh, no, not at all.
I didn't leak.
So, wait a minute.
Did we leak... No, we didn't leak, he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received a letter from Ford detailing the charges against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I didn't cover up Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't leak her story", Feinstein told the committee, as reported by The Hill.
She asked me to keep it secret and I kept the letter secret as she asked me to.
But the Senate denial did not seem to be accepted by the president, who responded to it during the conference on Saturday evening: "I tell you, that was really bad body language.
Maybe it's not the [leak], but it's the worst body language I've ever seen.
The president went on to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, claiming that the Democrats were using the allegations to their advantage.
They are determined to return to power at any cost.
You see the convicts, the vices, they don't care who they hurt, who they trample on the way to power and violence", the president said, according to a Mediaite report.
Dundee Stars 5-3 against the Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer has taken two exiles for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars made up for their loss in the Premier League on Friday against the Belfast Giants and won the next game 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Eagles had an early lead over two outs scored by Patrick Dewar and Francis Villiers.
Mike Sullivan and Gordon Cooney put their team back in business until Dwyer gave the advantage back to the Yankees.
François Boucher tied for the Dutch until two goals by Lucas Landevalde Nielsen ensured victory.
It's the third loss of the season in the Premier League for Adam Keefe's side, who came from behind to beat the Dons 2-1 in Belfast, Day 1.
This is the fourth meeting this season between the two teams, and the Giants have won the last three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFaul, and David Rothford scored the goal for Bouillier when he doubled the score four minutes later.
In a busy first quarter, Sullivan brought the home team back in at 1:10 until Matt Marquardt kicked Caunney's equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer promised the Giants an early breakthrough advantage when he scored his second goal of the night in the bottom of the first.
The home team was re-arranged and Bouchard again scored a goal that tied the game at 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran combined their efforts to help Nielsen give the Dons their first lead in the game, late in the second quarter, and Nielsen secured the Dons' victory with a fifth goal, which came from the half-court in the final quarter.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will take on home field against Milton Keynes in the next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller who sacrificed his life to ensure that hundreds of passengers on a plane could escape an earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller has been hailed as a hero after sacrificing his life to ensure a plane with hundreds of passengers can take off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing after a powerful earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Sunday and triggered a tsunami wave.
Strong aftershocks continue to hit the area and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palo.
But even though many of his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gnawan Agong refused to abandon his position in a shaking control tower at the Mutiara Sís El Gúfrie airport in Palau.
He's staying put to ensure that Battic Air Flight 6321 can safely take off.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought he was going to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Indonesia's Air Navigation spokesman, Johannes Sirite, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News reported in Australia.
We've got a helicopter from the Balicapan airport in Clementon to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the chopper arrived in Palo.
"Our hearts are broken by the news", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands as the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency says access to Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"The death toll is expected to rise further as many bodies are still buried under the rubble and access to many others is not possible", said the agency's spokesman, Sato Pourvo.
Waves up to six metres high have devastated Palo and the city will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes are bringing in aid and supplies.
Risa Kosuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News that ambulances are bringing in bodies every minute.
Clean water is rare.
The mini-markets are being looted everywhere.
Jan Galvend, the head of the Indonesian Red Cross, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working fast to help the survivors, but we don't know what they'll find there.
It's a tragedy now, but it could be worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, arrived in Palau on the first day and told the country's soldiers: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the missions related to the evacuation.
Are you ready? CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by the Lombok earthquake, which killed over 550 people.
Air New Guinea says one person is missing after a plane crash in Laguna
The airline that operated the plane that crashed in the Pacific Ocean's lagoon in Micronesia now says one person is missing, after earlier declaring all 47 passengers and crew safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air New Guinea said in a statement that as of Saturday afternoon, it was not in a position to say what had happened to one passenger.
The airline said it's working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try and find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the passengers and other crew members after the plane hit the water while attempting to land at the Chukchi airport.
Officials said on Monday that seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital Saturday and that the rest were in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in Laguna a short distance from the runway.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane had missed its course.
American passenger Bill Gaines said the plane came in on a very low runway.
"This is a very positive thing", said Gaines.
Gaines said he and the others were able to make their way to the emergency exits in waist-high water in the submerged plane.
He said the flight crew was stressed and screaming, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working nearby on a dock improvement also assisted in the rescue effort, using an inflatable boat that brought people ashore before the plane sank in about 100 feet (30 m) of water.
Air Safety Network (ASN) data states that 111 people have been killed in Papua New Guinea's recorded airline crashes in the last two decades, but Air New Guinea was not involved in any of these incidents.
An analyst details the events of the night a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution made its case on Saturday in a retrial of a man accused of burning a living Mississippi woman to death in 2014.
Analyst Paul Rowealt of the U.S. Department of Justice testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to connect the movements of the defendant, Quinton Tallis, 29, and the movements of the victim, Jessica Chambers, 19, on the night of her murder.
According to the Clarion to Daguerre report, Rowlett said he obtained the location data from a number of cell phones that showed Tallis was with Chambers on the night she died, concealing his previous claims.
When the data showed that his cell phone had been with Chambers's during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went out to talk to Sanford.
Sanford got on the stand and testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecution asked if Tallis was telling the truth when he said he was with Sanford that night, Sanford said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville.
Another contradiction was that Tallis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records indicate they've only known each other a week.
Rowell said that sometime after Chambers died, Tallis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact details from his phone.
"He's erasing her from his life", Hale said.
The defense will begin with her closing remarks on the third day, as scheduled.
The judge said he expects the trial to be moved to jury trial later in the day.
The High Breed: What is hip hop conscious?
The hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative perception of the genre and fill their music with positive messages.
The High Breed trio from Bristol, claim that hip hop has moved away from its origins as a tool to express political messages and attack social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists like Fuggiz and Common have been revived recently in Britain through artists like Akala and Lauki.
Another black man?
A nanny from New York is suing a couple for firing her after a racist text message.
A New York City nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an unsolicited text message from a mother who complained that the nanny was "just another black person".
The couple denied it was racist and likened the lawsuit to blackmail.
Lynsey Plasko-Flexman, mother of two, expressed disappointment when she discovered that her new nanny, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
"No more black people", Mrs. Plasco-Flexman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, twice.
According to a New York Post report, after noticing the lip-switching, Plasco-Flexman fired Ms. Morris, saying that the previous nurse, who was African-American, had done a poor job, and that she now expected to hire a Filipino instead.
Mrs. Morris was paid for one day's work and sent home with an Uber.
Now, Morris is suing the couple for the firing, seeking $350 a day in compensation for six months of work and living in the place that was originally rented, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, they don't do things like that", she told the Post on the day of the vote, adding, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple fought back against allegations of racism, saying that terminating Morris's deal was desirable, out of fear that they would not be able to trust her after they had hurt her.
My wife sent her something she wasn't going to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists", her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
But would you entrust your child to the hands of someone to whom you were rude, even if it was accidentally?
Your soft baby?
Come on now.
Plasco compared the lawsuit to blackmail and said his wife was due to give birth just two months before the incident and was in a very difficult situation.
You want to go after someone like her?
"It's not nice to do that", added the investment banker.
The legal case is still ongoing, but the court of public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, and killed their behavior and the arguments they used.
A new letter reveals that Paddington's publishers feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear.
Bond's daughter, Karen Gankle, who was born shortly after the book was received, said of the letter: "It is difficult to imagine yourself in the place of someone reading the book for the first time before it is published.
It's very amusing to know now what we know about the huge success of Paddington.
After saying that her father, who worked for the BBC as a photographer before being inspired to write the children's book by a little toy bear, would have been bloodthirsty about the postponement of his work, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "merry-go-round" following his death last year.
She added that her father quietly took pride in the eventual success of Paddington, whom she described as a very important member of our family.
"He was a quiet man, not a proud man", she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a kid who gets something: you're proud of him even though it's not really because of you.
I think he saw Paddington's success more or less like this.
Although it was his own creation and imagination, he always said it was the work of Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
Ned called regularly and said she was in a really bad way, not expected to last.
And then I got a call from Mand saying that she was gonna die in the next two minutes and that I should say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication the doctors gave her to keep her heart rate up was slowly disappearing out of her system.
She died sometime before that and it's over, it's all over.
All I could do was sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't breathe or scream or cry because I was surrounded at that moment by families and people.
I really had to hold on.
Eventually, Mrs. Adnan-Lapros, now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane with other passengers, unaware of the ordeal she had endured.
No one knew, she said.
My head was spinning, and tears were coming down all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I had this amazing sense of identification with Ned.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Mourning women hanging posters on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys hung postcards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people could call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he started suffering from depression and he committed suicide at 18.
I don't want any other parent to feel like I feel every day", she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Ladney, said her son was a promising chef with a sticky smile.
Everyone recognized him by his smile.
They always said his smile lit up every room.
But he stopped working before he died, because it was a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Miss Davis said, "I'm constantly worried about a chain reaction".
Mrs. Davis created the postcards so that people would know there's someone they could turn to and talk to, even if it was a friend.
Don't sit still - you need to talk.
Mrs. Humphreys, Ms. Davis' longtime friend, lost Mark, her life partner of 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt depressed or downhearted or anything", she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was down the stairs on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their presents he didn't make eye contact with them or anything like that.
She said that his death was a huge trauma for them, but that they'd gotten over it: it created a hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to keep fighting.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is on the line as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought, if we can really get what he's asked for - a limited-time, limited-scope investigation - maybe we can bring a unification exception", Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee had "been torn apart" by the entrenched partisan obstructionism.
Why didn't Cuano and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their deterrence is all about timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, November 6th, and if, as expected, the Republicans fail to win, they will be greatly weakened in their efforts to elect the man they want to the highest court in the land.
George W. Bush picked up the phone and called the senators to coax them into supporting Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and through him met his wife, Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate to allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm his nomination to the Supreme Court.
Several North Korean prisoners were executed under Kim.
The number of North Korean refugees to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byung-sig, citing South Korea's Unification Ministry, said the number of abductions last year stood at 1,127, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the main reasons for this were tighter border controls between North Korea and China and increased amounts being charged to people who are fleeing.
Pyongyang has not made a public statement.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors end up receiving South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded DMZ between the two Koreas.
China treats the Irites as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them.
Relations between the North and the South - which are still technically at war - have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier today, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on the stalled negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
The meeting came after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where the two agreed to work towards an era in which the Korean peninsula will not have nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
Without trust in the United States, there is no trust in our national security and in such circumstances, there is no chance that we will unilaterally dismantle our weapons first, "Ree said in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bertrand Cavanaugh "hysterical", and says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court nominee "hysterical" and said his character was not conducive to serving on the Supreme Court.
Flossie responded to this in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman ever appeared like that, they would say 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the 30th.
Kavanaugh has vehemently denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blaisey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kawano was very emotional, and at times almost screamed and choked as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats on the committee and called the arguments against him "a coordinated and grotesque character assassination organized by the liberals' anger at Hillary Clinton's loss in the 2016 presidential election".
Flossie said she thought Kavanaugh's testimony proved he couldn't serve on the Supreme Court because it showed prejudice against the Democrats.
"I think he's disgraced himself with these statements and the way he's been going after the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to unseat Kavanaugh if his nomination was approved and if the Democrats won a majority in the House.
"I'll put it this way -- if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not fit, not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he currently sits", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh currently serves as a judge on the Federal Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Flussi added that as a Democrat, she has concerns about possible rulings by Kavanaugh against Obama health care or the ruling in Wiro v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearing, Quano avoided questions about the possibility of overturning certain Supreme Court decisions.
"There's no reason for a hysterical, opinionated person to come into a courtroom and expect to be told, 'This is great,'" Pelosi said.
And women should use it.
It's a sharp criticism, months and years of anger are pouring over his cheeks, and she can't express them without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, do you?
She kept going, and I had a lot of help from a woman who was a manager at another place, who said that she also cried when she got angry, but she developed a technique and every time she got angry and started to cry, she would say to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm not mad.
And then she just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant.
Tears are more commonly used as an outlet for anger, in part because they are not inherently understood.
One of my most significant memories from my early career, in an office with most men, is that I found myself once crying in an unspoken rage, and an older woman grabbed me by the back, this was a cold manager that I had always been a little afraid of, and dragged me to the stairwell.
"Don't let them see you cry ever", she told me.
They don't know you're a rabid.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy that they've managed to suppress you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Art was caught conducting an extramarital affair on a ship called Monkey Business and dropped out of the race, Schroeder, deeply frustrated, realized there was no reason she should not consider the idea of running for president herself.
"It wasn't a decision I had thought through", she told me 30 years later, and laughed.
There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Because she joined the campaign too late, she ran out of money, so she swore she wouldn't run unless she raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who had donated $1,000 to men, had given her only $250.
Do they think I'm getting a discount?
When the speech announcing that she would not campaign officially, she was so overwhelmed by the emotions - gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that was so hard on raising money and focusing on voters instead of representatives, and anger at the sexism - she choked on tears.
"You'd think I was having a nervous breakdown", Schroeder recalled the way the press reacted to her.
You'd think I was sponsored by Clinch.
I remember thinking, what will they write on my tombstone?
Did she cry?
How the U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The opening stages of the U.S.-China trade war have been deafening, and although the war is far from over, a rift between the two countries may benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, fired the opening shot earlier this year by imposing tariffs on important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of goods, effectively taxing half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has responded in the same currency every time, most recently raising tariffs by five to 10 percent on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has vowed to strike back at any U.S. strike, and it's unlikely that the world's second largest economy will give up anytime soon.
Washington's request for her return would mean a capitulation to her demands, but a public bow to Arafat would be too embarrassing for China's president, Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing manages to do the right thing, the pressures of the trade war with the US could positively support China in the long run, and reduce the interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for an economic meltdown in either country is actually much more dangerous than India has previously been seen to be", said Abigail Grace, a research associate focusing on Asia on the New American Security think tank.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready to welcome refugees back voluntarily and calls for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by a long war that has lasted more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Moulem said that conditions in the country are improving.
Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the war on terror, he said.
The government continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by the terrorists to restore the situation to normal.
All the conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they left because of terrorism and one-sided economic measures designed to undermine their daily lives and livelihoods.
According to UN estimates, over 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mujahid said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the destroyed country.
But he stressed that the regime will not receive conditional aid or aid from countries that have financed the rebels.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the United States by a final score of 16.5 - 10.5 at the Circuit de la National Golf outside Paris, France.
The United States has so far lost six straight times on European soil and has not won the European Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe won the crown again when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, reached the 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
American Phil Michelson, who fought for the entire tournament, sent his shot from the bottom to the water on the par-3 16th hole, losing the game to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all of his rounds, becoming one of only four players to go 5-0-0 since the tournament's inception in 1979.
American player Gordon Spieth was defeated 5-4 by the lowest ranked player on the European team, Thorbjørn Olsen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's number one player, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, who may be playing in his last Ryder Cup.
With a record of eight Ryder Cup appearances, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the European player with the highest number of tournament wins with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
So I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to have the Cup back.
"It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help", said Garcia, emotional after the European victory.
He's handing over the torch to his countryman, John Ram who beat American legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in Sunday's singles match.
"The immense pride I feel, to beat Tiger Woods, which I watched growing up", said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods has lost all four of his games in France and his record now stands at 13-21-3, a career Ryder Cup record.
These are some bizarre statistics from one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, only to be beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find their way on the turf, except for Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Pino who played top-level golf throughout the tournament.
Team USA captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance, saying, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought back.
There was a moment this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We failed.
Good for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll reorganize, I'll work with the PGA and our Ryder Cup committee, and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to serve as captain.
Got to take off the hat.
We're not going to get married.
