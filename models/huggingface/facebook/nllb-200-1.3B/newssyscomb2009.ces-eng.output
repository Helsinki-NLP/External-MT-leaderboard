Right-wing populists triumph in Austria, collectively 29 percent
The significant weakening of the two parties in the previous grand coalition and the significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties have led to early parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday, according to the first preliminary results.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) has suffered particularly heavy losses, with the position of current chairman Wilhelm Molterer seriously shaken.
In contrast, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Korutansk hechtman Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 percent of the vote, but it is losing 5.5 percent of the vote compared to the last elections in 2006.
Even worse was the case with the ÖVP, which lost almost nine percent of the vote with 25.6 percent.
It is the worst result of both of these big parties in the post-war history of Austria and especially for the people who called early elections, a literally disastrous result.
In early July, when the ÖVP withdrew from the coalition, the People's Party had a considerable lead over the SPÖ in preferences.
But voters apparently punished them for letting the government fall.
Early reactions to the results have been speculative about the possible resignation of party chairman and former vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molter.
Observers say that could happen as early as Monday at an extraordinary party leadership meeting.
Such a development would probably facilitate the path to the increasingly likely exit from the election result, namely the renewal of the SPÖ-ÖVP grand coalition.
However, given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Free Party (FPÖ) which had obtained a preliminary 18 percent and the BZÖ 11 percent of the vote - the Social Democrats also expressed concern about a repeat of 1999, when the People's Party agreed with the populists (the FPÖ was still united, but split from the BZÖ in 2005) to form a joint government, which even triggered sanctions from the European Union.
This is clearly the development Haider is betting on, who has already declared that he is ready to cooperate with any party and envisages a return to Vienna in national politics.
The Greens also entered the parliament, but lost slightly and fell from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
None of the other parties apparently crossed the four percent threshold and did not get into parliament.
Relations with India may cool
If the problem of Czech scientists accused of illegal insect collection in India were not solved, Czech Foreign Minister Karl Schwarzenberg said that there would be a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The minister made the remarks in New York after meeting his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee today.
"If it was not resolved, then yes, then there would be a certain cooling", he said after the meeting, which took place on the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said after the meeting that the executive could hardly interfere in judicial matters.
However, he stated that in the case of Peter Svahy, who was acquitted and fined, the central government could negotiate with the local government in Džiling, whose jurisdiction the matter falls under.
"His problem could be solved", said the minister.
For Emil Kucher, sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherjee said it would be best for him to appeal to a higher court.
He can then apply for bail and await his sentencing, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner made the same comments at the meeting.
"He recommends appeal to the higher court, then it would be possible to pardon him", said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the matter is to provide the convicts with "competent legal support", the Indian minister said.
He also said that such assistance was already being provided by the Indian side.
"We are keen to maintain the best of relations with India which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize this", Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, he stressed to his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider it a profound mistake to imprison and prosecute these Czech scientists", he declared.
Answers to the question whether he had received from the Indian side a promise to deal with the matter, the minister avoided.
"I've had enough promises", he said.
The judge is fighting for the seabed
They access a wall-mounted electronic map of Australia and the surrounding marine areas.
But he's not interested in the continent, but a tiny dot lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, and with it the seabed.
The area is as big as the continent itself", says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a 30-member team working for the UN Division for Oceans and the Law of the Sea.
His boss, the division director, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, monitors the interpretation and occasionally adds to it.
There's a lot of work and enthusiasm.
The seabed hides a world so far little known, rich in natural resources.
There are oil, ores, and other minerals, but also previously unknown living organisms that may hold the key to developing a cure for cancer.
Bottom larger than the mainland
The coastal states have begun a vigorous bid for new undersea territory today.
They are exercising their rights under the UN Convention, which was agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is especially the case in the so-called continental shelf, which often extends several hundred miles from the coast of a given country.
It has an exclusive right under the Convention to all resources on the continental shelf.
"Simply put, the continental shelf is that part of the seabed and its substrate that is the natural continuation of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the coastal sea, often beyond the two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone", explains Mikulka.
The request for the demarcation of the outer continental shelf by a country to the Commission must be supported by a comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on a number of costly surveys and measurements.
It's the result of years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical expertise.
The Commission has so far examined five applications, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three countries have succeeded so far,' adds Mikulka.
Worldwide, Australia's recent success has been noted as the first to significantly expand its undersea holdings.
But he has also gained New Zealand - the area of the seabed that the commission granted him last week is about 1.6 million square kilometers, about six times the size of the country itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the research.
The future profits from exploiting the seabed will be, they promise, priceless.
The other States will gradually submit their applications.
They may do so up to 10 years from the date of ratification of the Montego Bay Convention.
Where the continental shelf ends, the ocean floor begins, a region declared by the convention to be "the common heritage of mankind".
No state has an exclusive status here.
The right to mine in this area is granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"But there is no Klondike", says the director, Mikulka, adding that its "individual areas are legally defined and their regime is enshrined in the treaty".
Czech Republic in the Pacific
Part of the seabed now belongs to the Czech Republic.
They are shared with other former Eastern Bloc states within the joint organisation 'Interoceanmetal'.
In 1991, it was granted the status of 'pioneering investor' under the Convention, along with investors from a few other States.
It has a permit to mine in the Clarion Clipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, which lies between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area investigated by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is broken, it's some kind of underwater replica of the Tater.
"It can be mined on a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is rich in polymetallic concrete containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese", says another lawyer Ind Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian division worker, Rober Sandev, brings one of these concrete to the show.
It's like a little potato or, with a little imagination, the fabled scheme that brought the Golem back to life.
German special forces were involved in the hostage rescue.
The Egyptian government has asked for help from Germany in dealing with the hostage crisis - experts have arrived.
When the situation escalated, special forces were ready, but no deployment took place.
More details are gradually becoming public about the release of 11 European tourists who were abducted in Egypt.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces were also involved in the rescue operation.
According to the statements of the ministries, both experts of the Federal Army, members of the GSG9 anti-terrorist group of the German police, members of the Federal Police brigade, members of the Federal Criminal Office and logistics experts from the Technical Assistance Service (Technisches Hilfswerk) were released on the spot.
However, according to a further statement by the spokesmen of both ministries on Monday afternoon, German forces were not needed because the kidnappers let their prisoners go and fled when they recognized signs of a violent liberation.
The Egyptian government reportedly accepted the German offer of aid as a support force for action on the ground.
"Fortunately, that did not happen", said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The attackers kidnapped a group of travelers consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian, and eight of their Egyptian guides on September 19 in southern Egypt.
After being kidnapped in the desert region of southern Egypt, the hostages were moved to the border areas between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unclear until the last moment, as did details of their release or possible ransom payment.
The rescues are now in order in Cairo.
Minister Steinmeier said the hostages are being released under the care of the German Embassy.
He didn't comment on the details of the release.
There is no information yet in Berlin as to when the rescued will return to Germany.
According to Bild, all five tourists are scheduled to leave with special forces on one of the German Air Force's Airbus planes and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The U.S. House of Representatives has rejected the bailout package.
The upper house of the US Congress has narrowly approved a $700 billion bailout for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones is down sharply.
By a vote of 206 to 227, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government's bailout for financial markets.
Despite calls from U.S. President George W. Bush and leading politicians from both parties, there was no majority for a program that would ease the chaos in the financial markets.
The dramatic action was one that the supporters were desperate to convince critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, urged the congressman to vote yes before the vote, even though, he said, the plan was not popular.
"It's hard to get political approval for avoiding something that hasn't happened yet", he admitted.
During the vote, the Dow Jones fell more than 6 percent, or 600 points.
The reason was the investors' fear that the state bailout package might fail.
Shortly before the vote was over, the index rose, only to fall sharply after the announcement of the package's failure.
Experts now expect further serious turbulence in international financial markets.
For the program to take effect, it needs the approval of both the House and the Senate.
Travel agents report rising booking numbers
It looks like winter will be good for German tourism entrepreneurs:
According to one study, there was a significant increase in bookings for the coming months compared with the previous year - even more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic growth, the German appetite for travel remains intact.
For the winter season, travel agencies recorded a 31 percent increase in turnover compared with the same period last year, the German Travel Association (Deutscher Reiseverband, DRV) reported in Berlin on Monday.
According to a survey by the GfK Market Research Institute, increased booking numbers are already available for the autumn months.
According to DRV, turnover was therefore about 11% higher in October compared to 2007.
These results are based on GfK figures, which evaluates the booking data of 1200 German travel agents each month and interpolates them to the overall market.
This result included bookings of trips made up to the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar exchange rate, travel to the US is the most requested, DRV said.
For these routes, it's about a third of the increase in bookings.
In addition, the Germans are particularly keen on Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as their home waters.
First of all, organized tours are on the way, said DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of the increasing energy and food costs, the costs are 'easier to calculate for the client than for an individually organised holiday'.
Laepple explained that consumers could save money by, among other things, using early booking discounts or all-inclusive offers.
The number of bookings was also very good in the summer months, so that the turnover will be higher again compared to the previous year - although another study shows that the number of Germans who took a trip has decreased compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
Endless repeat-ups, beer from the tuplets and celebrities in cut-outs from famous designers.
First time on the beer field.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's a blonde, a TV host, and she wears a custom-made earring.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is secondhand.
But one thing we have in common: we're not even three minutes into the beer field, and the photographers are already pouring in and filling up the memory cards - I'm flattered, because I'm at Oktoberfest for the first time.
That's how you can be friends.
Looks like my cheap cut served its purpose.
I'm here as a tourist and I live north of the sausage equator, so my sense of comfort in the cut was rather limited.
But once you arrive at Theresienwiese, everything is better than it seemed.
Almost everyone is wearing a woman's dress or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed - everything is perfectly normal.
The odd view at the banana-chocolate stand is only my umbrella.
One Munich woman pointed out that I had tied it wrong: "You are free on the left, virgin in the middle, married on the right, widowed on the back".
I'm going to secretly shift the swing back to the left.
"Okay", he says, and laughs.
Others do not engage in subtle flirting techniques as much as they do, wearing simple felt hats that say "To drunk to get dressed!" and shoving their naked butts at passersby.
A young man with such exhibitionist tendencies is called Bob, he's from England and he's also here for the first time at Oktoberfest.
He finds it "gorgeous", with an extended "ooh".
He's telling me after he's been relieved by a drunken ointment.
Right next to one of those fire hydrants that everyone thinks are garbage bins.
So Bob is one of the dreaded "Wildbiesler", as they call the freewheeling in Bavaria.
Others don't have the luck to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight o'clock at night, a swarm of paramedics rushes through the Oktoberfest square to take care of the poor drunkards.
Healers always appear in packs - four carrying covered stretchers from tent to tent.
They're like most beer-meadow visitors: empty there, full back.
Who lies beneath the sheets of this coffin of perdition is invisible.
"Those who can't go any further", one of the paramedics calls in response to my question and disappears into the crowd.
Police released the name of the accident victim
The name of a 63-year-old woman who died in hospital after being hit by a car in Essex has been released.
The accident on Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon affected Carole Paulson of Chelmsford Road.
She was taken to the Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident on suspicion of reckless driving.
He's already been released on police bail.
Turkey's diplomatic horizons are widening
Long before Turkey began its bid for European Union membership, the European powers were eager to penetrate deep into Turkey's hinterland.
On the eastern shore of the Bosporus, perhaps only twenty steps in Asia, stands one of the finest monuments of this failed imperial ambition.
Hydarpasha Railway Station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in a Neo-Renaissance style.
Well, that's what the tour guides will tell you.
The building sits circular at the end of the platforms with towers on each corner of the facade, for an indistinguishable view from some provincial German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is falling apart.
But once you get inside the gated register, you can't doubt the size of the establishment whose westernmost gateway was the station.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolian-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, which had entered the game of empire late, intended to realize its ambition to control the Middle East with this railway, which would lead to Damascus, Baghdad and on to what is now Saudi Arabia.
But German imperial ambitions collapsed during World War I.
Their tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular troops.
The relative isolation from the surrounding territories created by the frozen borders of the Cold War is gone.
British and colonial troops were advancing from Egypt, pushing the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there's bad news for Hydarpasha station as well.
In 1917, an explosion of a munitions train destroyed its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has been gradually being torn down and history has circled it.
Today, however, this gateway to Anatolia and further east serves - at least symbolically - to highlight the expanding horizons of Turkish diplomacy.
The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) has created a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the surrounding territories created by the frozen borders of the Cold War is gone.
Now a new policy is being implemented - Turkey is getting involved.
It is remarkable that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To review the parameters of this new policy, I boarded a night train to the Turkish capital, Ankara, where I was to meet with one of the leading AKP foreign policy experts, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a winding ride along the tracks that recalled the old-world rhythms of the famous documentary Night Post, I arrived in a Turkish metropolis, designed as a new city for a secular state that wants to turn its back on its Ottoman past.
However, the AKP with its well-known Islamist roots represents a paradigm shift of the Turkish consensus.
She has aroused suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
The taxi took me to the AKP headquarters, a state-of-the-art stone and metal building, deliberately built on a developing suburb, surrounded by half-timbered department stores and power stores, where middle managers in business suits - men and women - meet to make early morning trades.
Suat Kiniklioglu could easily be a centre-right politician from almost any other European political party.
Sako, tie, I'm sure he had a Blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate surroundings.
The Cold War was an anomaly", he told me.
Turkey was cut off from its territory.
Today, you have to look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't a choice.
It must have done both.
"But surely there will come a time", I asked, "when Turkey may have to make a decision?"
"Turkey", he said, "did not wish that such a decision had to be made".
He then pointed out what almost everyone I spoke to here had said almost by heart: Turkey's relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea region are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, it seems that Europe as a whole can, metaphorically speaking, go east on these rails to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha Station, after another mostly sleepless night, I thought of those two German gentlemen, Herr Ritter and Herr Cona, who watched this building being built a hundred years ago.
How surprised they would be to find out that European ambitions in the Middle East may now be, in substantial part, in Turkish hands.
And as I waited at the port for the ferry back across the Bosporus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was called "the sick man of Europe".
So it seems that at least at the time, there was little doubt as to which continent should claim this fascinating land.
Not to be missed: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: "As Guildford's music director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (obituary, September 11th) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
As part of the district's musical plan, he formed the year's outstanding youth choir, Proteus.
He was supposed to be under 21, but by the time Proteus sang his last song in 1979, several of us were almost 30 - we just refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological shape-shifter) represented the willingness and ability of the choir to indulge in any music presented to it - whether madrigals or Messiaen, either alone or with the whole orchestra.
The musical adaptability created by such a young choir was often overwhelming, always exciting, all thanks to the inspiration of one man and the passion for music that remained absolutely unchanged throughout.
How often has Tod told us to "let the music speak for itself".
He said, "A composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the music.
Sing it then!"
His technique was absolutely clear and precise, but it was neither dictatorial nor flowery.
Whatever the musical standard was, he always raised it.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If there was a conductor to be knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in the two decades he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
I've reviewed over 100 of his concerts over the last 40 years or so, and I can honestly say that I've never been disappointed in any of them - and I've been inspired many times.
Tod Handley had such a great combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated conductors who, he said, simply "dragged one or two drenched ovens around the world".
He'll be missed by many of us.
The name of the company is:
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary William Woodruff (September 25) states that "in 1946 he returned to economic history at Oxford and in 1950 became a research fellow at Houblon-Norman... while studying for a BSc, MA and PhD".
This is from Woodruff's author's note in Beyond Nab End, but it's not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953 he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and during this time completed a dissertation on the British Rubber Industry, led by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 as British Rubber Industry.
He actually spent 1950-51 in America as a research fellow at Houblon-Norman and the summer of 1952 at the University of Illinois, Harvard, and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for good and moved to Illinois.
It's not known why Woodruff went through this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend the exhibition "Flamenco and Life" by José Vicente Resina, because his documentary black and white photographs are amazing.
I was captivated by the simplicity and the powerful charge with which they affect the viewer, and the consideration and respect they show to the photographed.
An exhibition that shows a lot of emotion.
Resino can capture the magic moments".
Honda strikes again with its bestseller
In November, Honda will begin selling the second generation Jazz.
Whereas the predecessor of this single-seater already had considerable space, it now offers an even more spacious interior.
This is coupled with improved engines that enhance driving comfort and allow for greater fuel economy.
Evolution rather than revolution.
That's the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although the aesthetic lines of the new Jazz are very similar to the previous model, many changes have been made to this single-seater.
The new platform, the new dimensions and the new engines are among the most innovative designs.
Before we explore the new model, it should be noted that the new Jazz comes six years after the launch of the first generation.
So the first thing we notice is the fact that Honda took a shorter time to rejuvenate this model than other manufacturers.
Although Jazz is less well known in Europe, it has become a phenomenon in other markets.
Take Japan, the country where the Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002, and again this year in 2008.
In Japan alone, almost a million units of the Honda Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The secondary market was the old continent, with about half a million units sold in six years.
However, Honda aims to increase sales of the new Jazz in its category.
In 2007, the Japanese company sold a total of 83 000 Honda Jazz, but in 2009 it is estimated that there will be 100 000 vehicles sold, representing a 17% increase in the European market.
As regards the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8 000 Jazz since 2002, representing 6,7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation of Jazz, the Spanish branch expects to sell 2,000 units in the whole year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to significantly mitigate the decline in sales in Spain.
The management of the carmaker thus de facto expects to end the year with a total of 22 000 units sold, which is 4 000 fewer than in 2007 and a decrease of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain to 1,8%, compared to 1,6%, a year earlier.
In 2010, the Japanese firm expects to reach 2%.
To achieve this share, Honda is counting on the success of its next new model.
It is the Honda Insight, a compact-sized, 5.5-foot (4.37 m) five-door hybrid, which the Japanese company promises to sell around 200,000 units a year worldwide.
As regards markets, the Japanese manufacturer estimates that 50% of Insight will be sold in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be split between the old continent and Japan.
Sales of the Honda Insight are expected to start in the first months of next year, once it is presented to the public in Valencia in January.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has all the dimensions.
Its length has increased to 12 feet [3.9 m] (an additional two inches [5.5 cm]), its width to 6 feet [1.69 m] (an additional two inches [2.0 cm]) and its wheelbase to 8 feet [2.5 m], which means an extension of one inch [5 cm].
The height, on the other hand, has not changed, remaining at 1.52 meters.
The increase in dimensions also increased the interior space.
This advantage was achieved by the use of the new platform and by the placement of the fuel tank in the centre of the car, which had already been used in the previous Honda Jazz.
The volume of the luggage compartment - which has a double bottom system - has also been increased to 399 litres, 19 litres more than the volume of the luggage compartment of the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions are present in the 1.4 engine version, as the boot capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
In addition to the exterior features, such as the rear LED lights and the possibility of a panoramic glass roof, the rear seats are also easier to access.
The doors leading to the second row of seats allow an opening angle of 80 degrees compared to 67 for the first Jazz model.
The second generation Honda Jazz has new engines.
Initially, this small model will be offered with two petrol engines of 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology, which enables lower fuel consumption, lower CO2 emissions and delivers excellent powertrain improvements while providing high torque at full engine speed.
The first 1.2-litre engine has a power output of 90 hp at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
This engine - which had 78 horsepower in the previous generation Jazz - has a 5.3-litre engine capacity and 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
Compared with the previous engine, which had 83 horsepower in the previous generation, the current engine will have 100 horsepower.
The Honda Jazz 1.4 with 100 horsepower has a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and an emission of 128 grams of CO2.
The Bee Car prevents rainfall
To advance the development of accident protection technologies, Nissan has this time been inspired by nature, specifically bees.
This Japanese company has developed a robot that mimics the flight of bees, thus preventing collisions.
One of them is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step in collision-prevention technology.
Engineers at the Nissan Motor Co.'s Center for Technical Advancement have developed the robot in collaboration with the Center for Scientific and Technological Advancement Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doie, general manager of public relations for technology, research and development of the brand, the BR23C is presented as an extension of the four zones of the Nissan safety shield.
The robot's mission is to enhance the collision prevention capability of the vehicles of this brand.
During flight, each bee creates its own personal oval-shaped space, which is very similar to a Nissan safety shield.
Most important, though, are the compound eyes of bees, which can see in all directions at an angle greater than 300 degrees, allowing the bees to fly in their personal space without stopping.
In creating this visual feature, the engineers designed what they called a laser range finder.
It shall record obstacles up to a distance of 2 metres within a 180° radius of the BR23C, calculate the distance of the object and send a signal to the on-board microprocessor which shall immediately convert it into a collision warning.
"When an obstacle is detected, the robot mimics the movements of the bee and immediately changes direction by turning the wheels to the right or even a greater angle to prevent a collision.
The biggest difference from any existing system is the fact that all the bending maneuvers are completely instinctive.
If it were not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles", explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobile Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike bees, the robot cannot move up and down or diagonally, its movement is limited to two dimensions and the direction made possible by the rotation of its wheels, but not to an infinite number of directions and possibilities as in bees.
So Nissan used the rotation function to prevent the robot from crashing, in addition to accelerating and slowing down.
"The device only needs to process information every few seconds and behave according to that data.
It requires no retention of information or logical intuition from previous maneuvers, allowing it to operate without interruption with only two dozen kB of memory.
You may be surprised, but we don't talk about gigabytes or mega-gigs in memory".
This is the first step in the development of new technologies for immediate collision prevention, technologies that Nissan predicts will be used in production cars within a decade.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible future use of this technology could be to incorporate a unit into a GPS satellite navigation system, which would guide the driver to his destination while avoiding obstacles on the road.
Enjoy the fear before you take out a mortgage
It must be acknowledged that the US Treasury, in addition to having the capital to distribute injections, lacks no ingenuity.
Facing the crisis, and to prevent Americans from taking risky mortgages from banks with questionable solvency, they created a popular online-science game called "Bad Credit Hotel".
It wasn't "Hotel of bad credit"... or a confused hotel.
The hotel and especially its receptionist look gloomy, so you have to think once, twice, three times about whether it's the right time to apply for a loan.
And most importantly, where to ask, which is probably what she intends.
The fact is, the game contains useful information, though not very detailed.
It's a site for young people rather than a place for the general public.
And what happens when the game ends?
Inside the hotel, there's a room of dreams.
At least something, because I'd rather not talk about buying a house...
Morgan Stanley opens its MUFG capital
Morgan Stanley announced that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the largest bank in Japan, would be joining the company, issuing $9 billion to acquire 21% of its capital.
A week after disclosing their preliminary agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG intended to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's common stock at a unit price of $25.25, representing a total volume of $3 billion.
The negotiated price is 19% below the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG is investing another $6 billion in convertible securities, which will provide it with a 10% return and have an exchange rate of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley has clarified that the entire operation will be carried out on the basis of an average unit price of $29 which is 28% below its current rate.
Morgan Stanley's stock still fell 6.79 percent and hit $23.07 around 5pm Greenwich.
"This strategic merger represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to banking holding status", explained John Mack, CEO of the US-based group.
The new charter was adopted by Morgan Stanley last week, which is supposed to allow it to diversify its activities, but at the same time it puts it under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank.
His merger with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest asset on Wall Street to take a far more cautious approach than before.
The terms unveiled on Monday, among other things, show that the deal has been altered over the past few days: last Monday, Morgan only announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
"Just a week ago", explained in Tokyo Tošihide Mizuno, executive director of MUFG, "we thought our participation would be made up exclusively of ordinary shares.
However, given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to minimise the risks and also cover ourselves".
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will pay for Morgan Stanley securities 7% less than their book value.
And the operation will result in a 20% reduction in earnings per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preference securities into ordinary shares in a year's time, provided that the latter are traded for a certain period at a price 50% above the exchange rate, i.e. approximately USD 47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital provided by MUFG will enable it to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its cash position.
However, the spokesperson of the group refused to provide any specific information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
Following the MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should boast a Tier 1 solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan specified that since the end of August he had "substantially" reduced his balance sheet.
The last few weeks have been difficult for the group, as its stock exchange has fallen by half, while the insurance costs against the risk of default linked to the debt have risen sharply.
These costs developed in the opposite direction on Monday, but remained high at around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other survivor of Wall Street's major investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, announced that it had withdrawn $15 billion, in part from Berkshire Hathaway, a Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa on Monday in Quito.
Re-establish the republic around 21st century socialism.
This is a joint project of Hugo Chávez, a Venezuelan, Eva Morales, a Bolivian, and Rafael Correy, an Ecuadorian.
Last Sunday, the third nominee put to a vote, following the example of his counterparts and friends, a draft of a new constitution.
And his mission is accomplished, as 64% of the voters, according to official results covering 80% of the vote, voted "yes" in the referendum.
According to these results, the "No" vote was 28%, 7%, void and 0,7% empty.
To pass the Constitution, he had to get half the vote plus one.
Two polls at the exit of the polling stations and a poll by an NGO predicted a clear "yes" victory on Sunday, putting it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa, by the way, demanded the victory of his constitution on the night of Sunday to Monday.
"The Constitution has won all the way", he assured, congratulating Ecuadorians at the governor's headquarters in Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
It goes without saying that Rafael Correa has received congratulations from Chavez and Morales, but also from his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which was conducted in a calm manner, according to the Organization of American States (OAS) observation mission, was on a 444-point text building the "new socialism" promoted by the president.
The draft constitution enshrines state power over the economy by reserving to it the "development planning" of a country that lives primarily on oil extraction by foreign companies and foreign exchange sent by its emigrants.
The proposal, which was backed by Corre, who was elected in 2006, also extends the powers of the head of state, who will be able to serve two consecutive four-year terms and will be able to dissolve the parliament.
Correa has already announced that he will exercise this power and will run for a new mandate in February 2009.
Among other things, the constitution affirms the principle of free health care and education, which the president has begun to implement in a country of 13.9 million people where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it also envisages a ban on the presence of foreign troops, ending the agreement between Washington and Quito to use the Ecuadorian base as a starting point for U.S. counter-narcotics operations.
19 hostages released in Chad
Egyptian commandos have attacked the kidnappers of 11 tourists and their eight-member escort, who were captured 10 days ago.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, who had been held captive in the desert for ten days, were safely transported to the Egyptian capital on Monday.
They were liberated by the Egyptian commandos in Chad during the morning.
The hostages arrived at about 15:30, apparently in good shape, aboard a special aircraft to the al-Maza military base, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transported, without the possibility of commenting to the press, by helicopter to a hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, for medical examination.
"They are in perfect health" and "no ransom has been paid to the kidnappers", said Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garrana at the airport runway.
Since their capture on September 19th during an all-wheel drive safari at the foot of Mount Uanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hostages have been dragged from one hiding place to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border guard, the director of the Aegyptous agency, the safari organiser.
A senior Egyptian security official indicated that 30 members of the special forces, who had approached the scene in two helicopters, had set off for the battlefield during the night just before dawn.
"There was a shootout, half the kidnappers were killed and the rest fled", said the source, who wished to remain anonymous.
He pointed out that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces unit "Blitz" were sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
From Belgrade, where he is currently, the Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini spoke of the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
"We have to acknowledge that we have achieved this result because of the professionalism and efficiency of our intelligence people, our special forces", he said, without further specification.
He also denied that the ransom had been paid.
Earlier in the evening, the Sudanese military said it had intercepted the four-wheel-drive vehicle carrying the hijackers on patrol, killing six, including the Chadian commander, and arresting two.
The army claimed that they were connected to the Darfur rebel group, the Sudan Liberation Army-Unity (SLA-U), which the movement immediately denied.
Letters - Silent majority of the cultural department
The debate over the financing of culture is a newspaper headline and the subject of the current election campaign.
That's all right.
But one area of our cultural life is still being neglected.
Who will rise to pillage the meagre sums that are being given to small museums, archives, archaeological digs and national landmarks that are starving to death?
What politician would dare remind the federal government that they are neglecting their landmarks and their historic buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we don't have laws that actually protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is dedicating three and a half million euros to the restoration of the simple Château de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
In our American neighbors, it is written in the Constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the culture of Americans, and that this heritage is to be protected by all citizens, all elected representatives, and all county organizations, in cooperation.
In Quebec, the Federation of Historical Societies of Quebec has at least 40,000 volunteers, united by 211 historical, monumental, archival and genealogical societies, working to uncover history, preserve the wealth of private archives, and protect archaeological remains for a few pennies.
Often these same companies are the watchdogs of our monuments, who are desperately protesting as developers and officials unleash their bulldozers on old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When are we finally gonna get the grandstands for history and monuments?
Benelux Governments the state-owned part of Fortis Bank
The Benelux countries will help the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which was the first in Europe to be in difficulty due to the widening impact of the crisis on the US mortgage market, by partially nationalising it: the three countries will support the money and insurance institution, which also has a capital stake in Hungary, with EUR 11.2 billion.
The Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed at the highest level this weekend, with the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
Fortis is the first euro area bank to be hit by a major crisis in the context of the crisis on international financial markets, which has been raging for more than a year, and the decisions taken in this regard could in some respects be regarded as precedents.
Under the decision, which was adopted on Sunday night, all three countries will buy back almost half (49%) of the bank's assets there.
The Bank will sell with absolute certainty part of its capital holdings, mainly insurance activities, which it purchased from the Dutch bank ABN Amro last year.
Fortis' stock began to fall sharply last week, and by the second half of the week, the institution was already showing serious signs of a crisis.
But analysts agree that with 85,000 employees, the bank is too big to let it go bankrupt.
The company's stock fell 12 percent on Friday alone, to a 14-year low.
The stock has fallen by more than two-thirds since January.
In view of the current share prices, the total market capitalisation of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but according to the company's management this is unrealistic.
The management blames the fall in Fortis' shares on the uncertainty in the overseas market related to the adoption of the US $700 billion package.
The stock's already up slightly on Monday.
On Friday, the new CEO, Filip Dierckx, was appointed to the bank.
The Mint was also looking for private buyers, but no one has come forward with a more serious offer.
The Belgian Government has already announced that investors do not have to worry about losing their money.
There has been no panic among the bank's clients and the branches have not been attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis has a separate branch and has also acquired several leasing companies.
The fox in the henhouse
Life and health insurance companies in America often reject the possibility of contracting insurance with the applicant based on people's drug purchasing records.
Data protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
'There is a data protection programme which binds the use of prescription data in all cases to the consent of the person concerned.
It has to be in the hands of an independent person, or we're leaving the chicken coop to the fox", quotes the Washington Post Richard Dicke, author of a program designed to monitor prescription drugs.
Insurance companies make the premiums and the amounts paid in the event of insured events dependent on the health status of the persons concerned and, if the risk is assessed as too great, do not take out insurance with them.
In the past, they sent people for medical examinations and only signed contracts after they knew the results.
A decade ago, Dick devised a much cheaper method: a pharmacy customer's ID number would easily tell the pharmacist what medication he or she had purchased in the past year and a half, from which the program would infer the patient's medical condition.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-lowering medication, it indicates that he has practically uncontrollably high blood lipids, which immediately puts him in the higher-risk category.
Several versions of the programme are in circulation, some of which also determine the risk factor, so that there is almost no work left to do at the insurance company except for the paperwork, although there are minor difficulties.
The disadvantages are that some medicines can be used for several purposes, some compounds are useful for migraines or hot flashes, but they are also effective against depression.
They represent a significant risk-increasing factor from the point of view of commercial insurers, whereas the first mentioned difficulties do not.
Special companies have been set up to request and process the data, and they ask the patient for permission before they can obtain the necessary information from the pharmacies.
They are now being forced to do so by the authorities, even though they have not been punished for their negligence.
Some companies have recently been processing the results of laboratory tests and combining them with the data on the medicines they use, thus providing an even more accurate picture of the health of patients.
Data is increasingly being accessed by more companies, and controlling its use will be increasingly difficult.
There is a special law on the protection of health data, but it is only applicable to healthcare providers and insurance companies.
A bill that would give the government the power to control companies that specialize in providing data is before Congress.
Richard Dick recognises that this is not enough: he has therefore developed his programme so that the transmission of data is subject to the explicit consent of the person concerned.
Another thing is that he can hardly refuse the authorization in question, otherwise the insurance companies will not contract with him.
So chickens are somewhat dependent on the goodwill fox.
The global Marseille menu is
The EU and India to double trade
As the European Union and India are each other's leading trading partners, this topic, alongside other, mostly global issues, also topped the agenda of the ninth summit.
The French-Indian summit will also be held today, with a focus on cooperation in the field of atomic energy.
The European Union recognises that India is an emerging democratic power which should be given a greater say in international affairs, but the Member States have so far failed to find a common denominator on the issue of supporting New Delhi's permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
The question was not even discussed further at yesterday's ninth summit in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, the EU's current President, and European Commission President José Manuel Barroso and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs Javier Solana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they also agreed to double trade turnover to more than €100 billion in five years.
Given that trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an overly ambitious target.
In this context, 26 existing bilateral agreements with India on civil aviation have been aligned legally, giving green light to future aviation.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised that the negotiations would be expedited.
The aim is to balance the balance, while the EU is India's number one trading partner, New Delhi is only the ninth among the EU's partners.
The Summit also focused on global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and terrorism in all its forms, were condemned by both sides and called for an urgent UN conference.
They also urged the conclusion of the Doha round of trade talks, although both have a large share in its failure so far.
The European Union has confirmed that it will stick to its energy and climate agenda, which is to reduce emissions by at least 20% by 2020.
India has agreed to this, as well as the need to reach a global agreement at next year's climate conference to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2050.
Both sides would also like to prevent food price increases and support the convening of an international conference to discuss the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is arriving in the French capital today, where a bilateral meeting is about to conclude a deal on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
Paris believes that the 20 billion euro construction contract for India's nuclear reactors will be awarded to French companies.
According to the news agency, the agreement is for 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than 300 Italian publishers
A large participation of Italian publishers at the international book fair in Frankfurt.
More than 300 Italian publishers will attend the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair expects more than seven thousand exhibitors from a hundred and one different countries to take up 171,790 square metres of exhibition space with more than four hundred and three thousand titles to see, with Turkey as the guest of honor.
Deputy Minister of Culture Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian Government at the opening ceremony at the Italian Pavilion: Italy will actually participate institutionally with the Italian Centre (Punto Italia)  on 264 square metres of exhibition space.
A press conference will follow in the Room Struktur Buchmesse in Pavilion 5.0: it will be an opportunity to present the figures, trends and perspectives on the state of publishing in Italy.
The figures show that the importance of books by foreign authors in relation to the total Italian production is decreasing, mainly in relation to children's and adult literature.
The plane of Steve Fossett, the millionaire who disappeared a year ago, has been found.
The remains of the plane of Steve Fossett, a millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007, were found while flying over the Nevada desert.
The wreckage was discovered on a plateau at an elevation of 3,000 feet in the Mammoth Lakes region of Sierra Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
However, there were no human remains inside the plane.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson dispelled any remaining suspicions: "The plane was found, we sent a team there, and we now know for sure that it's exactly the same plane that Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared", he told a news conference.
So the sheriff made it clear that no human remains were found on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old millionaire has been considered dead since February.
The US Transportation Safety Bureau (TSB) announced that several hours after the wreckage was identified, an investigative team was dispatched to finally identify the plane: it was, precisely, a Bellanca 8kcab, missing since 3 September 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington, Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, near the Nevada border, some of Fossett's personal effects were found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
It's two documents in Fossett's name, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett was stopped a month after he disappeared.
The billionaire earned a place in history thanks to a long collection of firsts.
In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete a round-the-world flight in a hot air balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world without landing.
Among his many records is the flight to an altitude of 15,445 meters over the Andes, even though he was a co-pilot.
Look, the commercial you don't expect
One unusual Suv with an original design and precisely defined decisive lines, wide surfaces with precise angles.
This is, in short, the latest born Glick of the compact Jeep house of stars, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to bring a whirlwind of innovation to this sector.
Thanks to its unconventional design, the communication will be unexpected and unconventional, which will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk and will be available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from 17 October.
In this way, the advertising campaign accompanying the debut of the new vehicle will also launch an unofficial communication method through a futuristic 3D poster campaign, which is used for the first time in Italy for a car brand.
The maxi poster project, divided into three different phases, will dominate Milan's main shopping street, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision and with the help of special glasses, which will be distributed near Corsa Como, it will be possible to see the new Suv in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, if you look at the picture, you get the impression that the car is coming out of the poster.
Then, using the innovative technology of Elumina8, the new Glock will be illuminated at different times in all its small details, to be then reassembled into a single image.
Mercedes is undoubtedly trying to introduce something new to the stereotypical field of automotive communication with this advertisement.
Will he be able to attract future customers in this way?
So we know who the Italian hooligans are.
From Trivenet, they risk Daspo.
Who are the 150-200 boys and girls that Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group, which has been following the Nazionale azzurra for years and which, to be honest, has never made any excessive problems.
She never even met the other guy's fans.
The orientation of the group is right-wing.
The founders are from Trivenet.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
In Sofia, they were joined by groups (few indeed) from Campania and Puglia.
They have three-colored flags with the cities of origin of the participants: on Saturday night they were removed so that they could not be recognized.
They're inspired by the English fans.
They found real Nazi fans in Bulgaria, Levsky.
Figc has made available to Italian fans 144 match tickets: all by name, so easily verifiable.
And Viminale actually checked them all: among those who went to Sofia, there was no one with the ongoing Dasal, no one who was banned from visiting stadiums.
Four blue fans who had previous offenses from the stadium were denied tickets and banned from the game.
Now Viminale is waiting to read the messages coming from the Bulgarian police, then it will take action: In this case, Daspo can be given for five years at least to fans who were arrested or identified during the riots.
The international Daspo, which prohibits the visit of not only Italian stadiums, but also all of Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, won't set foot in a stadium.
Here's to luck.
But now there is a fear of emulation: that means that more than 150 will be added.
"We must put out this fire immediately and not excuse those who behave in this way", Viminal confirms.
So, "all eyes wide open, especially for the national match on Wednesday in Lech".
A small nucleus of supporters is in Puglia.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio will meet, on Tuesday Casms, who can count on one part of Aise, a secret service that deals with problems in the stadiums.
"Chorus leader-leader and stretched arms during the Mameli hymn?
This is the thought of Domenica Mazzilli (expressed in a very unfortunate way), who is the director of the Viminale Observatory for a few weeks (he took the place of Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was formerly the mayor of Trieste, where the core of the Ultras Italia supporters, founded in 2002, is located.
It's true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it's not a crime to celebrate the leader, but of course the behavior of these 150-200 fans is a disgrace.
"I am not a sociologist", adds Observatory Unit, "crimes are attributed to the country in which they occur.
So far, this group has remained within the boundaries, now we're going to take a good look at what happened and evaluate for the future.
But let us also speak of whistling at the Mameli hymn: it is not a crime either, but if you will, it is rude . . . "
