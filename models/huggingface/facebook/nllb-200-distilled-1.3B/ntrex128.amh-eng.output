Welsh AMs are threatened with 'like a butterfly'
Some AMs were concerned about the idea that they should be called MWP's (Welsh MPs).
The case arose from a proposal to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
The AMs in the political world are worried that it could bring ridicule.
A Labour AM said he was worried his party would "face off against the TWP and the PWP".
For readers outside Wales, TWWP means fool in Welsh and PWWP means fool.
One Plaid AM said the group was generally "not happy" and suggested options.
The Welsh extremist said his group had a "receptive mind" about the name change, but it was a short word jump from the MWP to the MPET.
In this context, the reading of the Welsh alphabet W is similar to the reading of the Yorkshire English U.
The council commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce similar changes, said: "The final decision on any definitions of what the council members are called is indeed theirs".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 empowered the Welsh Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Welsh Assembly published the results of a public consultation that received widespread support for a proposal to rename the assembly the Welsh Parliament.
On the issue of the designation of AMs, the Commission chose Welsh MPs or WMPs, but the MWP alternative received the majority of support in the public consultation.
The AMs are clearly offering alternatives, but reaching an agreement could be a headache for the current chair, Elaine Jones, who is expected to submit the amendment bill in weeks.
The amendments include the rules on the dismissal of AMs and the structure of the committee system, including other changes to the way the Assembly operates.
AMs have the final say on who should be called when debating the law.
Macedonians vote to change the name of their country in a referendum
On Sunday, voters will vote to rename their country the Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was held to resolve decades of dispute between Macedonia, which has its own state, and neighboring Greece.
Athens has repeatedly opposed its bid to join the EU and NATO, arguing that the name of its longtime northern neighbor indicates a claim to its territory.
President of Macedonia George Ivanov, who opposes the vote on the name change, said he would not consider the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, say the name change is a simple fee to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's were silently sounded as churches in Harlem struggled
"The elderly I spoke to in history had a coffee shop and a church on every corner", said Mr. Adam.
"Today there are none".
He said the disappearance of coffee houses is understandable.
"Today, people are interacting socially in a different way", he said.
"Cafés are no longer the local saloons where people go regularly".
"The money from the sale of property in the churches is feared to be short-lived, as leaders predict, "and will be where it started too soon".
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings filled with communal houses where people of unfamiliar ethnicity live.
"Many of the people who buy the communal houses in this area will be white", he explained, "and so we will speed up the closing date of these churches because most people who come to these communal houses are not expected to be members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black community: the city's community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The first white Methodist conference was in the 1930s.
The soon-to-be-appointed Black Caucus took ownership of the building.
St. Martin was led by Rev. John Howard Johnson in a strike against merchants on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, who were being held by the Black Convention for hiring or promoting blacks.
The building was badly damaged by fire in 1939, but when Father Johnson planned to rebuild the church, they built a musical instrument for it.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor, St. Martin, proudly called the instrument "the poor man's bell".
The experts who played the instrument last July called it something else: "cultural treasure" and an irreplaceable "historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, a University of Michigan scholar, also played the world's first multi-instrumental, played by Dionne A. Lind, a black musician who moved to the large multi-instrumental at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Meriwether, St. Martin did not replace him.
The last few months at St. Martin's have been a tale of complex architects and contractors, some by church leaders and others by the diocesan bishop.
The warehouse - the governing body of the diocese, which is made up of church leaders - wrote in July that the diocese "wants to spend the expenses on the warehouse", although the warehouse is not involved in the hiring process for architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complain about the lack of transparency in the diocese.
A 13-year-old boy swimming to catch lobster in California was injured by a whale
A 13-year-old boy who was swimming to catch a whale lobster at the opening of lobster season in California on Saturday was injured in a shooting, officials said.
The accident occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach, Incinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and his friends were swimming for about half an hour on Saturday morning when they heard the boy screaming for help and they called the team to pull him out of the water.
Hamel said they initially thought it was a joy to catch a lobster, but then realized it was screaming, "I'm bitten!"
'I Touch You!'
The entire barracks was open, Hamel said, and they noticed it as soon as they arrived with his son.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" adds Hamel.
The child was flown from Radley Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was listed in critical condition.
The whale species responsible for the accident is unknown.
Life-saving catcher Larry Giles said in a press release that a whale had been spotted at the site a few weeks earlier, but was not considered a dangerous species.
Gilles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper body.
Authorities have closed the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swamis in Incinitas for 48 hours for inspection and security purposes.
According to Giles, there are more than 135 species of whales in the area, but most are not considered endangered.
Sainsbury's plans to enter UK beauty markets
With the help of expert support from staff such as Sainsbury's, it has a large store-style beauty shelf of boots, supercuts and Debenhams, organised into different sections.
As part of a £2.8 billion push into the UK market that continues to grow as fashion and domestic sales slow, the biggest beauty shelves will be tested in 11 stores across the country, with the move to larger stores next year if successful.
The supermarkets that invest in beauty came to save the once-claimed shelf space for TVs, heaters and furniture.
Sainsbury's said it will double its beauty supply to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, EC, Twizerman and Dr. Pepper.
Current products from Laurel, Mabeline and Burts Bees will find branded enhanced locations similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket will also restart the boutique's makeup range to make products suitable for vegetarians, which are highly sought after by most young consumers.
The fragrance retailer will also be testing discounts at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, south London, and the second is due to open later this year in Sealy Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and convenient local shopping for small amounts of food each day mean that supermarkets need to do more to encourage people to visit.
According to Sainsbury's CEO, Mike Coupe, in an attempt to trick the company with its offers and more services and non-food products, the supermarket chain's retail outlets look like a supermarket with a highly fragmented department store.
Sainsbury's has placed argon outlets in hundreds of stores and introduced several new homes since buying both chains two years ago, boosting grocery sales and making its holdings more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to transform it into a large department store with beauty and pharmacies has failed.
Sainsbury's tried to launch with Boots in the early 2000s, but the deal fell through over a dispute over how to divide the proceeds from the grocery stores in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy to Celesio, owner of the Lloyd's pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
Lloyd's said it would play a role in the plan by adding luxury skincare brands, including products such as La Roche-Poissy and Vinci, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's business director, said: "We have changed the look and feel of our beauty shelves to enhance the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in colleagues who are specially trained and ready to advise.
Our brands are tailored to suit every need, and the convenient location and environment means that we are now a convincing beauty destination that challenges the old fashioned consumer".
Peter Jones 'angry' after leaving £11 million deal with Holly Willoughby
Dragon's Den star Peter Jones is 'outraged' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11 million deal with her lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for them for the furniture and accessories brand Truely.
The pig trade was linked to the Gup brand of Gwentese Paltrow.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning announced on Instagram that she was dating.
Holly Willoughby has angered Dragons' Dane star Peter Jones by leaving her luxury lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on her new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was "very angry" when the golden TV personality told a tense meeting in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, the business district's headquarters, that her new contract would cost up to £1.5 million and that she no longer had time to sell them furniture and accessories brand Truely.
The business was linked to Gwyneth Paltrow's Gup brand and was said to have doubled Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune.
Jones was on a jet from Britain to a resort when Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Trulia.
According to a source, "Truly Holly was one of her top priorities.
It was her long-term future job, which she would spend the next decade.
Her decision to leave has completely shocked everyone involved in the matter.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to starting.
The warehouse at the head office in Marlowe City is filled with ready-to-sell goods.
The morning presenter is one of Britain's leading bank star experts, and the departure of this man will cost the company millions of dollars, from trash to candles and underwear, and will further delay its successful next journey, industry experts said.
As a result, his long-standing partnership may end.
Wilogie, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have a ten-year relationship with John and his wife Tara Cappe.
Wilogie further strengthened her relationship with the CAP in 2016, and John, 52, became chairman in March.
The Couples Holiday Together and Jones own a 40% stake in Baldwin TV Productions.
Wilogie is set to become a brand ambassador for MS, replacing Ant McPartlin, presenter of ITV AME Celebrity.
Sources close to Jones said last night that they "didn't want to comment on his business".
After a surprising conversation, we both fell in love.
Some have ridiculed the president for making unexpected comments and saying something positive about the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump wearing a ticket?
Trump mocked: "This is the voice of the new news reader".
and i will not give up on anything.
He said Kim was pleased with the second meeting, which was held in Singapore in June and saw better progress in making North Korea a nuclear-free country, hosted by Trump.
But the nuclear disarmament agreement is still in place.
North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho spoke to world leaders at the UN General Assembly, three months after the June summit in Singapore. The General Assembly said the North had "not responded adequately" to the US arms offer to North Korea.
According to him, the US has continued to impose sanctions to influence us.
Trump made good points in his lengthy speech.
He said we are getting along well with North Korea.
We were heading for war with North Korea before.
Millions of people could have died.
We have now established good relations.
he said his efforts to improve relations with kim had produced positive results, including the launch of rockets.
When asked about the unusual relationship with Kim, he said he did not agree.
Trump said in his speech that it would be easier to be president than to have 10,000 people in a crowded hall, pointing to the crowd in front of him, saying there were now about 200 people in the hall.
Hundreds of people have died in the tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia.
The UN has said that following the Lom Bok earthquake, foreign NGOs do not need help.
Although 10 percent of Lom Bok's population has been evacuated, no national disaster has been declared.
According to Ms. Sambong, "Unfortunately, in many cases, there is no request for international assistance, which is very difficult".
When Save the Children organized a team to travel to Palu, it was not certain if there was a possibility for foreign experts to come and work on site.
According to a spokesperson for the National Disaster Agency, Mr. Sutopo, Indonesian authorities in Palu were observing the possibility of international agencies entering the site and working.
Indonesia has been unfortunately vulnerable to earthquakes, as it has been on several occasions.
Although tents are plentiful following the tsunami, there are few on other beaches.
The lack of a tsunami warning in Palu, although not with much effect, was a major contributor to the deaths.
Moving from one island to another in Indonesia was not easy even when it was safe.
Natural disasters complicate logistics further.
The ship, which is home to a hospital in Lom Bok, was on its way to help victims in Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach Palu.
President Joko Widodo promised during his election campaign to work to improve Indonesia's infrastructure, spending heavily on roads and railways.
But the lack of individuals to be funded has been postponed so that the administration of Mr. Jaco will not be an obstacle to the elections next year.
Mr. Joko is under increasing pressure and a large number of Muslims are becoming conservative.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and 10,000 displaced in a street fight between Christian and Muslim mobs, who used knives, bows and other weapons for filming.

I was walking towards Kante, and I touched the ball only once, and I hit him with my fist without thinking.
Chelsea led 1-0 until halftime with a goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blue's forward was the goalkeeper who passed the ball back to Mateo Avalanche in that game.
Kovacic returned to the midfield after a quick pass.
Then a great ball was thrown to Hazard, bringing him closer to the goal area.
Hazard also passed the defenders and scored with his left foot against Liverpool's Alson Baker.

Cromwell's Parliamentary Monument has become a valuable monument to the history of the area.
What is being done is justice, unlike many British cultural and religious gifts that were destroyed by the Taliban and given to the Persians.
The Chrome Whale community describes Mr. Crick's idea as idiotic and trying to rewrite history.
According to John Gold Smith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, the current dispute is aimed at removing a statue of Oliver Comwell outside Westminster Palace.
The English Civil War, which many do not accept, was neither ordered nor orchestrated by Cromwell.
The weakness of Chromewell can be seen in the price he paid for the works of his predecessor Thomas.
Sir William Hamlet's portrayal of Cromwell is a 19th-century proof of concept and history, and is still revered by many.
Mr Gold Smith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is revered by many, and was even more so in the 19th century, for his resistance to outside pressure in Parliament, especially from the royal family.
The historical dispute that I am putting the case in the correct way is a continuous one.
The fact is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the future development of our country, and Cromwell is a well-known figure who represents one aspect of that division.
His achievements are honored and remembered as a king on his throne.
The killer pigs injured a Chinese farmer to death.
According to local media, a farmer in a market in southwestern China was attacked by a pig and died.
The South China Morning Post reported on Sunday that Yuan was found bleeding to death in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province.
In Zheng Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005, a farmer, a pig owner, was preparing to inject a vaccine into his pig.
He and his cousin brought 15 pigs from the province of Yuan to the market last Friday to sell.
The next morning, his cousin was found dead, and the door to the neighbor's pigsty was reportedly opened.
He said the big pig's mouth was covered in blood.
The forensic investigation confirmed that the 550-pound pig was the reason for the farmer's survival, according to the report.
My cousin Agru was bleeding and injured  According to the Guliang Evening News, the victim was called Wu.
Security cameras showed Yuan entering the market to feed the pigs at 4.40 am on Thursday.
The body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not Yuan or his cousin.
A police official told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from harming others, adding that police were gathering information.
Yuan's family and market officials are discussing the amount of compensation to be paid to the deceased.
Although occasionally, cases of pigs attacking humans have been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and a man on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig was tied to a Welsh farmer's tractor until his owner threatened the animal and drove it away.
Pigs are not normally aggressive, but blood sensation can be "stimulating", a Minotoban farmer told CBC News until he was eaten by his pigs in 2012.
"It's their game.
They are like a child, they ask too much...they are not out to hurt you.
You just have to give proper respect, he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are set to bring heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cold coastal waters of northern Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring rain that will cause flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern US.
Rosa had Category 1 hurricane winds of 85 miles per hour as of 5 a.m. eastern time Sunday, and was 385 miles southwest of Mexico, Punta Eujena.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a tidal wave is forming over the Pacific Ocean and moving eastward toward the U.S. West Coast. Rosa will approach Baja California as a tropical storm on Monday, and deep tropical moisture will begin to move northward into the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will bring 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture will join with the incoming drizzle, causing heavy rain to spread to the southwest over the next few days.
1 to 4 inches of rainfall in the area can cause dangerous flooding, mudslides and landslides in desert areas.
Deep tropical humidity causes rainfall rates of about 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of 2 to 4 inches is expected, especially in most parts of Arizona.
With the nature of tropical rainfall, which is scattered, rapidly diminishing conditions can cause flash flooding.
It is not very wise to go for a walk in the desert when there is a threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains turn valleys into powerful rivers, and thunderstorms bring strong winds and dust storms to the area.
The approaching storm will bring some local rainfall to parts of the coast of southern California.
Over half an inch of total rainfall may cause moderate mud and slippery roads.
This may be the first rainfall of the local wet season.
Some scattered tropical showers will begin to approach Arizona around Sunday night and Monday morning before the rain begins to spread into Monday night and Tuesday morning.
Heavy rainfall will spread in all four corners from Tuesday to Friday.
There may be some strong temperature changes across the U.S. in October as the Arctic cools, but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this causes unexpected changes in temperature over short distances.
A major example of unexpected temperature variations is in the central US on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Summer heat will continue to spread over the next few days.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to have a warm start to October, with temperatures in the 80s extending from the southern plains to the northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast suggests a higher than average temperature for the eastern U.S. in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh trial.
More than 20 million people watched Thursday's spectacular testimony on Six Television Networks by Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanagh and the woman he accused of sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, political protests continue as broadcasters cancel their regular programming for a last-minute change on Wednesday: an agreement brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to allow the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% sure that Cavanagh had been drunk and assaulted at a high school party and tried to strip her.
Cavanagh said he was 100% sure that what he said did not happen in his emotional testimony.
It was watched by an estimated 20.4 million people on Friday, Nielsen reported.
The company was measuring the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and Fox Business Network and MSNBC.
The number of other networks that showed up, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, was not immediately available.
And Nielsen often has some trouble measuring people who look like offices.
To put that in perspective, the audience size is the same as a deciding football game or an Academy Award.
Fox News Channel, which strongly supported the nomination of Kavanaugh, led all networks with an average audience of 5.69 million at the daylong hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million viewers.
After the trial, demand continued at its peak.
Flake was the central character in the Saturday drama.
The Republican presidential candidate was caught on camera by CNN and CBS on Friday morning as he tried to take an elevator to the Justice Committee hearing after the Republican presidential office released a statement supporting Kavanaugh.
The protest was broadcast live on CNN, where they stood for several minutes, their necks on the ground.
a woman said, "here i am standing in front of you"
Do they think they are telling the truth to the State?
"Many women have no power, but you have power", it is said.
Flake said the office has issued a statement and they can speak more during the committee hearing before the elevator closes.
When the Judiciary Committee voted to elect Kavanaugh to the full Senate, all cable and broadcast networks were providing live coverage.
But Flake said he could only do so if the FBI understood that it would see charges against the candidate next week, as it did when a few Democrats were being dragged in.
Flake has partially admitted after talking to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talks with Coons and several senators, Flake announced his decision.
Flake has the power of choice, because it is clear that the Republicans will not get the votes needed to approve Kavanaugh outside the test.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh allegations.
British Prime Minister May Hayes accused of 'playing politics' over Brexit.
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May said politicians were "playing politics" by treating her plan to leave the European Union as a "play on British interests and national interests".
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives in Birmingham, UK for the Conservative Party summit on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, which followed the front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson attacked their Brexit plan, known as the Chequers Plan, saying the proposal that Britain and the European Union should collect their own tariffs was "totally absurd".
Police arrest Dayton Simpson, a suspect in the LSU player's death.
Police arrested a suspect in the shooting death of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wade Sims.
Dayton Simpson, 20, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Authorities released a moving video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the beating.
Police removed the glasses from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS affiliate WFAB reported.
After questioning Simpson, police said they believe Wade was fatally shot.
The bond is $350,000, The Advocate reports.
The East Bethesda County Coroner's Office released a preliminary report on Friday that the cause of death was a Christmas shot to the neck from the head.
The department said that the Louisiana State Police fleeing the fugitive had a special force, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and local citizens contributing to the arrest of the suspect.
"Joe Aleva, athletic director at LCU, thanked local law enforcement for their diligence and justice efforts".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LCU basketball coach Will Wade said his team was "deeply hurt" and "in shock" over Wade's survival.
"This is what you always worry about", says Wade.
The volcano has erupted in Mexico City.
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern residential areas of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the area after the volcano began erupting in the crater, reporting 183 gas leaks in 24 hours.
The centre was undergoing a series of severe shocks and tremors.
Images from social media showed ash layers covering the roofs of cars in Mexico City neighborhoods such as ZochiMil.
Geophysicists have detected activity on a volcano 45 miles (72 kilometers) from the capital after a magnitude-7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan protesters ahead of the annual celebration of the independence vote.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona after clashes between pro-independence protesters and police on Saturday, and thousands of people joined protests against the annual celebration of Catalonia's independence vote.
In a strike covered in eggs and sprayed with paint powder, masked separatist groups, led by police, created a cloud of dust on streets often flooded with visitors.
A fight broke out later in the day and police used batons to stop the fight.
For hours, pro-secession groups chanted "No forgetting, no forgiving", while supporters of unity chanted "May Spain live forever".
According to local newspaper, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries.
Tensions in the independence-seeking region continue to rise sharply after the October 1 referendum was declared illegal in Madrid and respected by its constituents.
The voters voted for independence in a large majority, despite the low turnout of those who were on strike against the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes across the region last year when police tried to stop voting at polling stations.
Freedom fighters spent the evening outside to protest a rally in support of the National Police on Friday.
The protest was held but in a different way.
Narcisse Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the construction workers' march with his wife, said he no longer had any hope that Catalonia would gain independence.
"Last year was one of the best years of our lives.
I saw my parents reading with joy because they could vote, but now we are stopped", he said.
Despite a significant and narrow victory in local elections last December, pro-Catalan separatist parties have struggled to maintain their zeal as most of their prominent leaders are either in self-imposed exile or in jail awaiting trial for their role in the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
According to 42-year-old mechanic Juan Puig, who was recording the rally on his phone, the clash was sparked by politicians on both sides.
"He is under more stress", he said.
Oriol Juancueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since last year, announced on Saturday that he will run in next year's European Parliament elections.
"We have seen from the Spanish government that participating in European elections as a candidate helps to identify and understand the pressures that come with a lack of democratic values", he said.
Londonderry: A man arrested after a car crashed into a house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car repeatedly hit a house in Londonderry.
The incident was reported at around 19:30 British time on Thursday at Ballinagar Crescent.
According to Death Inspector Bob Flemings, damage was reported to the entrance gate and the building.
It is suspected that an arrow may have been fired at a part of the vehicle.
The attack by the herd allowed Livingstone to record a 1-0 win over Rangers.
Dolly's first goal of the match secured Livingston's victory.
The rising Living Stone surprised the Rangers by signing Gerard, who had been coaching Ibrox and had lost just two of his 18 games.
Dolly's attacking skills forced the Hibernian club, backed by Gary Holtz, to finish second in the standings.
Zarate will face the eight-point leader Hearts on Sunday, without winning a game in the Premier League.
Before that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League.
Levin Stone replaced former coach Kenny Miller and continued his unbeaten run in six games under head coach Holt.
Living Stone missed the opportunity in the game against the visiting team Blunt.
The Holt team must expand their differential by taking advantage of the Rangers' problems without scoring.
Scott Robinson was seen turning his face towards the goal with a strong attack; Alan Litgau was seen only trying to receive comfortable front balls for the Carig Hatchets.
The home team is concerned that the Rangers may be disturbed by the visiting team as they play against them.
Scoring goals for the opponent is morally wrong.
As the Rangers got a perfect penalty, Living Stone was reinforced and along with Declan Gallagher and Robinson, Menga converted the ball from their midfield to a goal.
The Rangers were better at ball control at the time, but they were also better at close defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was more stable.
Despite the continuing violence, Alfredo Morelos used force against Kelly.
Alan McGregor and the League clash with the Livingston players as Scott Pittman deals with a Rangers goalkeeper injury.
Livingstone's goal area was repeatedly broken and easily attacked, and the pressure of the Hawkeyes who replaced Glenn Middleton meant that there were two perfect penalty kicks, one of which landed on the wrist.
The 'event' was thought to be the Livingstone game

The Livingstone phenomenon is a phenomenon that has been observed in the United States for over a century.
The precautions that man takes to avoid leaving a trail of mistakes are very surprising.
Especially after coming to the lead, their playing style and movement has not changed much, but the energy that has enveloped the team and the revival that has been created in the team is very commendable.
He has many heroes.
The Amble Hulk was huge and especially successful in organizing the defensive unit; otherwise, the manga would have been a challenge to Connor Goldson and Joy Worrell.
The Rangers' motivation for the games was down.
They were good under Zarad, but they scored poorly by the standards set.
The problem with their final balls is that they are not effective after they have created pressure, which keeps the team in the middle of the table and pulls them up.
Erdogan was given a special welcome in Koloni.
The Turkish and German leaders had a bright sky on Saturday (September 29) for breakfast in Berlin, which was a day of celebration.
President Erdogan's controversial visit to the country to strengthen ties with NATO has reached its final day.
He also advised on human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
Erdogan flew to Koln for the inauguration of a large mosque.
The city is home to many Turks outside Turkey.
The police explained the reason for the arrest of 25,000 strong protesters who marched in front of the mosque, but in contrast, a large number of the president's supporters turned out to see their leader.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents, many of them Kurds, have been heard to voice their condemnation of Erdogan's policies and Germany's decision to accept him.
The strongest protest is the difference between German-Turkish citizens who see visitors as heroes and those who criticize them as dictators.
Deptford road accident: A cyclist collided with a car and died.
A cyclist has died after colliding with a car in London.
The accident occurred at 10:15 BST on the busy Deptford Road, a junction of Best Darling and Ableyn Streets in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped the car and tried to get help for the victim, but the man died instantly.
The accident happened on Childers Road, months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run accident a mile away from Saturday's accident.
According to the Metropolitan Police, the police are working to arrest the man and will announce the results.
The road closure and the change of direction of buses and engines should be advised to avoid crowding the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in rioting.
According to the prison, six guards were injured in the riot in the men's section of the maximum security prison.
The disturbance began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still reported to be non-existent.
The special police force named "Tornado" is arriving at the scene to investigate the disturbance, and eight prisoners and a group have been confirmed to be involved in the disturbance.
The police officers who suffered minor facial injuries during the disturbance were treated.
"It has been said that HMP Long Lartin will deploy a specially trained prison task force that can prevent future incidents of this kind", a prison spokesperson said.
Six prison staff are being treated for injuries.
"We will not tolerate any disorder in the prison and we will also press the police to inform those who are not responsible and make them stay longer".
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous defendants.
The prison manager pointed out that in June, he was admitted to hospital after being attacked by a gangster.
Police officers were called to the prison after a violent riot at the prison in October last year, when prison staff were attacked with pool balls.
The storm, known as Rosa, could cause flooding damage in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, but drought-stricken areas could benefit.
A tropical depression is not expected to hit Arizona, but it could cause flooding similar to what the rain-induced storm Rosa did in the southwest desert area, which is not an energy infrastructure.
The National Weather Service warned of flooding in western Arizona, eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, as well as Phoenix City, including flooding in Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City on Monday and Tuesday.
Following the rain that began to fall on Monday, Rosa is expected to make her way to Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service tweeted about Phoenix, "Ten tropical cyclones that hit the 200-mile-wide Phoenix area, the most since 1950, are not only causing flooding but also a threat to residents".
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina, combined with heavy rains, covered 40 miles of the AZ region".
A recent model released by the National Hurricane Center predicts 2 to 4 inches of rain, especially in the Arizona coastal mountains, with up to 6 inches of rain unlike the rest.
Others, especially the southeastern Rocky Mountains and the Central Rockies, receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, while the Great Basin receives an average of 4 inches.
The pink rain can be seen as good luck for areas that are free from flood risk and have experienced drought several times.
Although the flooding is severe, rainfall is expected to be beneficial for some areas currently affected by drought, such as the southeast.
According to the US "Drought Control Agency, 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing severe drought, the second-largest drought on record", weather.com reported.
The first and most recent storm, Rosa, made its way to Mexico's Baja California Peninsula, following landslides.
Strong Rosa, which originated 385 miles south of Punta Iguazú, will continue northward with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph through Mexico Sunday morning, moving at 12 mph.
The flood causes the water in the Pacific to cool and the force of the water to wet.
The intensity of the tropical floods is expected to cause landslides in Mexico on Monday afternoon and evening.
Heavy rainfall is expected in several parts of Mexico, followed by severe flooding.
"From Jaca California to northwest Sonora, a total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected, and up to 10 inches when it passes", weather.com reports.
Rosa will travel north through Mexico before arriving on the Arizona coast on Tuesday morning, continuing its journey to Arizona and southern Utah on Tuesday evening.
"The main threat to the storm and its ensuing weather is heavy rainfall expected in Baja California, northwestern California and across the United States, including the desolate southwest", according to the National Hurricane Center.
It is expected that this rain will endanger lives, cause flooding, and cause flood debris to accumulate in desert areas and landslides, especially in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four attempted murders have failed.
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested following a fatal accident involving a 16-year-old in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured at 04:00 BST on Saturday at the Excelsior playground in the town of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to hospital with "immoveable injuries".
Police said that 17-year-old, 18-year-old and 20-year-old men were arrested overnight in Wracktock, Aven and Somerset.
The police have called on anyone who has left a mobile phone image to cooperate to help them facilitate their work.
Trump said Cavanaugh is "too tired, too uncooperative and too unpopular for the Democratic Party".
"Voting for lawmaker Kavanaugh is giving the Democratic Party a place to play a brutal and disingenuous tactic", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
"Cavanaugh is a disruptor and a nuisance to the Democratic Party's electoral process", Trump said.
Kavanaugh responded to a sexual assault allegedly committed by Christine Blasey Ford as a child a decade ago before Congress on Thursday, saying he was not physically or emotionally abused.
Ford has also provided additional evidence following the charges.
"The American people have seen the courage, ability and initiative of Cavanaugh", the president said on Saturday.
"Voting for the lawyer Kavanaugh is like voting for the best legal mind of our time and giving a place to a public servant with legal knowledge", he told supporters in West Virginia.
The president has said a lot about the election of Kavanaugh, whether directly or not, with the aim of gaining support in the upcoming midterm elections.
"The most important election of our lifetime has been five weeks ago.
"I am not running, but I am running well", he said.
"That is why I am ready to fight with the greatest candidates everywhere".
Trump protested that Democrats are on a mission to "resist and destroy".
The first practical election of Kavanaugh's candidate will be held before Friday, when the Senate is in session, senior leadership of the Grand Old Party told CNN.
Hundreds of people have been killed in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, with the death toll expected to rise.
An official said on Sunday that at least 384 people were killed and many more were displaced after a tsunami hit Sulawesi, one of Indonesia's islands, and a massive wave hit the coast.
Hundreds of people gathered at a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, where a 6m or 18ft high wave washed away everything including those who were enjoying watching the sunset in the evening, causing many lives and destruction.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake followed a tsunami in the area.
"At the time of the tsunami threat yesterday, many were doing their normal activities on the beach and did not run or try to escape, and were forced to flee", said Soetopo Purwo Nugroho, head of Indonesia's BNPB disaster management agency, in a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come by itself, it hit cars, logs, houses, everything on the ground", said Nugoho, noting that the tsunami was traveling at 800 km/h (497 mph) across the Pacific Ocean before hitting the coast.
A few people managed to climb a tree and survive the tsunami, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 stations in Palu.
Aerial photos from the disaster agency showed several buildings and shops destroyed, bridges destroyed and a mosque flooded.
A mild earthquake continues to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology and Applications Assessment said the force of the quake on Wednesday was 200 times greater than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The location of the city, which is located in a long and narrow ocean, would have made the tsunami even more likely, he said.[2]
According to Nugoho, the damage was "extensive" and destroyed thousands of homes, hospitals and shops.
The bodies of the victims of the attack were found under the rubble of the buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Death and destruction could rise in the coastal area of Donggala, 300 km (190 mi) north of Palu, near the epicenter of the quake.
No information could be exchanged from Donggala area due to communication equipment being out of order, said Nugoho.
The Red Cross said in a statement that more than 300,000 people live in the area, adding that the organization's staff and volunteers had headed to the site.
"It's very sad, but it could be worse", he says.
The agency has been accused of failing to provide information on the tsunami after the tsunami struck, despite warnings from authorities that the wave had arrived earlier.
According to a video posted on social media by an amateur, a man on a building was sounding a tsunami warning with a loud and fearful mix of noise.
Within minutes, a tsunami like a tower came ashore, washing away cars and buildings
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the video.
The quake knocked out power lines in the Palo area, making rescue efforts difficult.
The armed forces are flying relief supplies from Jakarta and other cities, officials said, but evacuees are in dire need of food and other basic assistance.
The city's airport has reopened for emergency operations only, but will remain closed beyond that until October.
The city's airline has reopened for emergency operations only, but will remain closed beyond that until October.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll is expected to exceed 800.
It's too bad.
World Vision's Donggala men, who arrived safely in the city of Palu, where their workers are camped in tents, faced serious dangers on their journey, Mr. Doseba said.
"I was told that many houses are unusable", he said.
It's too bad.
There were also complaints that some highly experienced foreigners were prevented from travelling to Palu when aid workers were leaving for their overtime work.
Under Indonesian law, foreign aid can only come after the disaster area is declared a national disaster area.
This has not been done yet.
"It is still considered a state disaster", said Ayulya Ariani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"If the government shows its willingness, that is, if it declares a national emergency, we will open ourselves to international assistance, but we will not be told anything".
Palu is in its second day after Saturday's earthquake and tsunami, and friends and family hope that some miracle will find those who were lost in that dark and terrible disaster.
On Saturday, a small child was found in a flooded area.
On Sunday, a woman who had been under the rubble for two days was rescued.
Gendon Sebandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, was training two paragliders for the Asian Games, which ends this month, but both died in the accident.
Others detained in Rowa Rowa Huitel were his students, including Mr. Mandagi, he said.
"As a seasoned para-gliding expert, I am personally under a lot of pressure and emotion.
Mr Gendon sent a WhatsApp message after hearing the news of the demolition of the Rowa Rowa Hotel, saying the situation had spread to the paragliding community, while giving up hope for the Palu fans at the Beach Festival.
He only got one gray check and one blue check.
"That means the messages didn't get through", he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 from an ATM while filling up in Newport on the Live
Thieves stole $26,750 from an ATM employee at Newport on the Live during a refill, according to Newport Police.
The driver of the car was opening an ATM at the resort and preparing to enter the cash, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a press release.
He said that he was busy with his work and a man came from behind and ran away with the money in his bag.
Witnesses reported several suspects trying to hide from the scene, but police have not yet said how many people were involved in the robbery.
Anyone with information about the identity of the persons can notify us at 859-292-3680.
[Kanya West: The rapper changed his name to Ye.
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
"The person whose name is registered as Kanye West", he wrote on Twitter on Saturday.
West, 41, was briefly known as Yea, the moniker he used for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes ahead of his live release of his new album Yandhi on Saturday.
Arya and Grande were scheduled to perform on the day, but cancelled "due to unrest", the show's producer announced.
Although the name was a professional acronym of the time, he had previously said that the word also had a religious connotation.
"I believe the word 'yes' is used more often in the Bible, and it is the English word 'you' that is used instead", he said in an interview with Big Boy radio station.
"here I am you, here I am we, and here we are.
From the Kanya or the only one, to the Ye or the reflection of our good, bad, controversy and our own.
The album is mostly a reflection of who we are.
He is one of the many rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, D. Diddy at various times, and this year he announced that he would choose Love or Love Brother.
Former West collaborator Jay-Z will be replaced by Jay-Z on Capitol and with or without Dash in the middle.
The Mexican MLO vows not to use force against the population
In a speech marking the 50th anniversary of the brutal and retaliatory attack on students, Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed that the armed forces would not commit similar atrocities.
Lopez Obrador vowed on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that he would "absolutely not use armed force to suppress Mexican citizens".
In the same square, on October 2, 1968, about 300 people were killed by gunfire at a peaceful demonstration, at a time when left-wing politics were beginning to take root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly scholarships to university students and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of education institutions are leading young people to organized crime.
The United States should double its funding for artificial intelligence.
Kai-Fu Li, an investor and artificial intelligence expert who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, says the US should spend twice as much on research and development as it does now as China is stepping up its involvement in artificial intelligence.
The comments come after various US government agencies issued AI ads, suggesting the country does not even have an artificial intelligence strategy.
However, China announced its goal last year to become the number one in artificial intelligence by 2030.
"While doubling growth may be a good start when other countries are far behind, we are working to make a positive change", Lee said.
Doubling the funding would make the next big breakthrough American, Lee said in an interview with CNN this week.[2]
Lee's book, China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Face++, one of China's leading artificial intelligence companies.
In the 1980s, he developed the advanced artificial intelligence system of the American Othello player at Carnegie Mellon University, and later served as the executive of Microsoft Research and Development and Google's China subsidiary.
Lee said earlier U.S. government programs such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge will recall the contributions of technology competitions and ask when similar competitions will be held to identify the next generation of visionaries.
researchers in the united states have warned that they must work hard to win government funding.
"It is not China that is taking the corporate leaders, it is the companies", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and Microsoft have hired promising students to work on artificial intelligence.
Li said the migration police reform would be a major contributor to China's artificial intelligence efforts.
"I think a green card should be issued to students working on PhDs in artificial intelligence", Lee said.
The Chinese State Council launched the next generation artificial intelligence development program in July 2017.
The China National Center for Natural Sciences provides financial support to educational institutions, which means that the National Science Foundation and other government foundations allocate funds to researchers in the US, but the quality of Chinese educational work is low, says Li.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will allow industry and academia to participate, and the White House announced the creation of a separate committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced it has allocated $2 billion to a project called Artificial Intelligence Next.[2]
NSF will invest more than $100 million in artificial intelligence research and development.
Meanwhile, the proposed US legislation to establish a National Security Commission has not seen any activity this month.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the country's name or keep it
Last Sunday, Macedonians voted in a referendum to decide whether the country should be called the Republic of North Macedonia, which is believed to end the country's ten-year-old dispute with Greece that has kept it out of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a territory with the same name, Macedonia, has used its right to vote to block its membership of NATO and the European Union.
The two countries reached an agreement on the name in June, but it has been opposed by nationalists who say it belittles the identity of Macedonia's predominantly Slavic people.
President Giorgi Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, but the referendum has also reduced fears that the people will be able to get the 50 percent they want.
The question on the ballot paper reads: "Stop the alliance with Greece and choose to remain a member of NATO and the European Union".
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the referendum was the price to be paid for Macedonia, which is one of the most progressive of the former Yugoslav member states, to join NATO and the European Union.
"I am here today to vote for my country's future, especially for the young people of Macedonia, who live freely in the shadow of the European Union, because this will allow us to live a comfortable life for all of us", said Oliveira Giojivaška, 79, in a speech at the SGP.
He said that although it is not prohibited by law, a sufficient number of members of parliament will accept and accept the vote as decisive.
The name change must be approved by two thirds of the members of Parliament.
The National Election Commission said that there were no problems with the election at 1 pm.
The parliamentary election was supported by 16 percent, compared to 34 percent who opposed it last year, but this election 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote because of my children, my home is Europe", 62-year-old Josie Tanczewski said in the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in a referendum on the country's name change in Macedonia on 30 September 2018, which would allow it to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was seen setting up a small platform with protesters and arranging chairs in front of the tent.
"We are with NATO and the EU, but we join with our necks up, not to be used by others in a low-level way", Kovaladkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity"
If they do not accept us as Macedonia, we will turn our faces to China and Russia and join the Euro-Asian Alliance".
Prime Minister Zaev said that being a NATO member would bring a lot of investment opportunities to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20%.
"I believe that more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO", Zaev said after the vote.
He said the "yes" result was a guarantee of the next time"
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Police Research Institute confirmed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum, while a smaller number will not vote.
In another poll conducted by the Macedonian Talma TV, 57 percent of respondents confirmed that they plan to vote next Sunday.
70% of respondents said they would vote "Yes".
For the referendum to be successful, one response must have 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum marks the first time that a policy that was in the interest of the Western government and has been in place since May last year has failed.
SEE: Manchester City's Aguero was pressuring Brighton defenders to score
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling were seen annoying Brighton defenders in a 2-0 win over Manchester City at the English stadium Eath on Saturday.
Aguero was expressing his joy as a fool after scoring in the 61st minute.
The Argentine striker was given a good ball by the midfielders as the game began.
He was running with three Brighton defenders before they were abducted.
Next, Aguero found himself wearing four green tags.
He was punched by a defender before entering the goal area at Brighton
He then accepted the offer for Sterling on the left.
After the English striker received a ball that reached the opposing team's goal line and went straight back to Aguero, Aguero hit the ball with his right foot and scored from the right side of the net against Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero is struggling with his injury on Agüero, he played", Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about it before, but it's 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
"We are lucky to score a goal in that situation"
Sterling was the first to create an opportunity for the Water Blues in a tough Premier League game.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero was in a difficult position in Brighton's goal area when he received the ball.
He then gave a great welcome to Leroy Sane, the left wing.
Sane pushed the ball forward to get closer to Sterling, who was far away.
The blue water went forward and scored, and then they were happy to slide out of the field.

Scherzer wants to play with Spoiler: The Rockies.
There is no reason to start the game unless the Nationals are out of the game.
We have heard that Scherzer, the all-time leading scorer, will dominate Colorado cricket on Sunday, but that will happen when the Rockies are out of the game with a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies beat the Nationals 5-2 on Friday to retain their lead.
"Although we are playing without a budget, the number of fans in Denver and the team playing at a high level this year is a concern, so we should probably stop playing.
Why I Did Not Want to Compete"
The Nationals are expected to laugh at the starter for Sunday, but the chances of him being the Sharks pitcher are expected to weigh.
Scherzer, who is expected to start for the 34th time, is expected to pitch on Thursday and prepare for the next one on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is in the second half of the season with a 2.53 ERA, 18-7 record and 300 strikeouts in 200.
Trump's West Virginia rally
The president said it was important to win the Republican primary by a narrow margin, as the Supreme Court has been ruling on Brett Kavanaugh.
"Everything we did in November was now followed.
It's been five weeks since the most important decision we've ever made in our lives.
This is one of the big ones. I am not running, I am running well, that is why I am everywhere to be the best candidate.
Trump continued, "You see this horrible bunch of Democrats coming out of the dark, watch what happens.
They are also trying to gain power by using every option they can, you see their uselessness and their corruption.
"As long as they have power, they don't care if anyone hurts them. They want to have power and control, and we won't give it to them".
In his words, "Democrats are on a mission to resist and destroy".
"As you can see, for the past four days, he has been calling the Democrats 'angry, uncomfortable, stupid and liars.'"
He called the Senate Legislative Committee and called Democratic Senator Danny Fenton by name, and a resounding support was heard from the audience.
"Remember what I said?
Did you lose the document?
What is it?
"Never, oh never, give me a chance - that's bad sign language, the worst sign language I've ever seen in my life.
The Church has stopped the use of forced labor.
people who speak with all their minds are impatient.
I am surprised that many of the work done by my party is not recognized.
To be honest, I am better with regards to Labour MPs, but I am not acceptable. Everyone is talking about what we think.
My friend in parliament, John Ryan, has been through the same thing because she was targeted for a smear campaign.
I have hosted many scandals in the face of a smear campaign over my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
responsible economic policy, national security, Europe and other issues on which Germany disagreed with previous leaders
"We want the conference to be inclusive and productive", Nottingham East Labour Conference announced last Friday.
Friday night's GC meeting was the best I've had in my eight years as a Labour MP.
Sadly, many conventions today may be silent, and "good guys, young guys" politics have been around for a long time, if not a new one
The Labour Party is increasingly ignoring the unique ideas that are being put forward, and the ideas that are being put forward are only accepted if they are approved by the leadership of the party.
This started after the Jeremy administration and when I was with him I thought I could take power by accepting and supporting the so-called political views, even if I disagreed with the national security or the single market of the European Union.
What I say in public is not a problem; what is a problem is the misinformation on social media, the opinions that are against his politics and that say I should not continue in the Labour Party.
And this is not my experience.
Of course, I believe I am luckier than my friends, because the opinions that come to me are political.
I personally admire the profession and my colleagues who are facing severe sexual and racist abuse and who do not back down.
The most annoying thing about politics is that the amount of influence that is being exerted is common.
Gerby Corbyn suggested last week that the Labour Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that there is no big church, and changing the electoral code with a motion of no confidence in everyone will only weaken the party further.
"for the past two years, i have been taught to be humble and not talk too much, and now i am successful"
But I didn't bring that into politics.
When my overall academic performance started to decline after joining Labour as a student 32 years ago, I thought I could become a local councillor or government minister to serve many in the public service.
I have not hidden my political views, including the last election.
There is no one in West Nottingham who is confused by my policy stance and disagrees with the current leadership.
To all those who support the motion on Friday, I cannot afford to waste time and money on a free exhibition, knowing that it will harm the country's living conditions, business and public services, in accordance with my loyalty to the Labour Party.
I have a message, not to stop the Nottingham movement, but to the constitution, which applies to the Labour Party and beyond: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat or political convenience will stop me from meeting your needs and doing what I believe in.
Chris Leslie is the MP for Nottingham West.
Ayr 38  17 Melrose: The unassailable Ayr moves to another
The two late entries are close to the final, but Ayr will definitely finish the day's Tenants' premiership
They are leading the table with ten games without a win.
Finally, the strong defense and the ability of the players to take advantage of good opportunities helped them win on the field.
"We have been tested in many games so far and we have not lost a single game, and I am happy about that", he said.
According to the manager Robin Christy: "Thanks to Ayr, they created better opportunities than us".
Grant Anderson's 14-minute try to convert a Fraser Clem to the goal gave Ayr the lead, but a yellow card for Scottish champion Rory Hughes gave the Warriors the lead, allowing Melrose to move better and Jason Batts to try a goalless ball.
Climo scored Ayr's first goal in the second half with a perfect penalty, and then scored another goal in the second half, allowing Ayr to lead the team with a 17-5 score.
Melrose started well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson made up the gap to make it five.
After a long-term serious injury to Rudy Knott, which kept him out of the game from the start, Ayr was able to take the lead from Climo's Stafford McDowell.
When Ayr United's Blair Maperson saw a yellow card, Melrose was replaced by Brook Colvin after the pressure was on towards the end of the game.
Despite a field advantage, Strawan Hitchens sees a yellow card for Clemon's capture outside the perfect penalty area; Ayr McPherson, who was the lead, is hit from behind.
A mild earthquake continues to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The star of the game is still considering another career, in the restaurant industry.
Current game star Ford Kern is considering a move into the hospitality industry and will be named director of a licensed restaurants company once it is established.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis has been cast in the popular BBC show, written and performed by the main characters and his longtime friend, Greg Hempsey.
According to the organizers, the upcoming ninth season will be the show's last and will feature Kearns' next project after Craig Lang.
He is a director of Adrift Morne Limited, according to public records.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kearny was considering a "successful restaurant business" in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours', Bolivia, which has no land border, hopes to open a road linking the country to the Pacific.
Sailors seized a ship loaded with various machines in the capital Lapape.
The water of public buildings has raised a blue flag.
From Lake Tikal, the Amazon's main attractions are marked with the slogan: "By law, the sea is ours.
It is our duty to bring it back".
Memories of the 19th century's bloody conflict over wealth, which is still evident in landlocked Bolivia, are eager to seize the Pacific Ocean without being taken over by Chile.
The hopes were high for a decade before Bolivia filed a lawsuit with the International Criminal Court on October 1 after a five-year hiatus.
"Bolivia must look positively at the transition that comes with strength, unity and a spirit of freedom from stress", said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will be watching the ICJ's decision on big screens in the country, hoping that Chile will be recognized as the sovereign state of Bolivia, after decades of fruitless talks in the Zague trial.
The decision of the controversial Bolivian President Evo Morales on Monday will not be a relief to those in Bolivia who are in favor of the Gamma and are up for reelection next year.
"We are getting very close to the Pacific Ocean", he said last August.
But some analysts say they are confident that the court's decision will not condemn the loss of Bolivia, and that if it does, things will change.
The UN body, which has its seat in the Netherlands, has no authority to determine the borders of Chileans, nor does it have the authority to determine the outcome of any talks.
"The fact that the decision of the International Criminal Court is known six months after the final hearing of the two cases, shows that the case is not serious", said international law expert Paz Zarate of Hunote Chile.
They can take us back to the last four years, beyond the cause of Bolivia's list.
"The issue of access to the sea is prohibited by the Bolivian administration", said Agost.
In her speech, her opponent declared that the decision would protect the dignity of Chileans.
I think Bolivia and Chile are having a hard time talking about time zones.
Since 1962, the two countries have not exchanged ambassadors.
Former Bolivian President Rodríguez Valtes, who represented Bolivia in the Zhejiang, said the speed of the court's decision was unusual.
"On Monday, Bolivia will open a new chapter in relations with Chile and work to the benefit of both countries, putting aside the disagreements of the past 139 years", he said.
According to Calzadilla, Morales, one of the most prominent presidents in Latin America, is using the maritime issue to create political fever.
"Bolivia will not give up its legal right to use the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"The decision is a good opportunity to resolve the past"
North Korea says nuclear deterrence is unthinkable unless the U.S. can trust us
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said the country would not dismantle nuclear weapons unless it first established trust in the United States.
He was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly last Saturday.
The United States must keep its promise made at the Singapore Summit of Great Leaders.
His comments came as the US is trying to restart nuclear diplomacy, now forgotten, three months after the UN Secretary General held talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Rhee said that maintaining sanctions is a "nightmare" and that the US's refusal to recognize the end of the Korean War would not deter North Korea.
The US is skeptical of a deal that would allow Pyongyang to significantly reduce its weapons.
Both Kim and US President Trump want a second round of talks.
Pyongyang is not expected to reduce its equipment to protect its safety, which has raised widespread suspicion.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month and pave the way for the second round of talks between Kim and Trump.
The Paris Fashion Show has unveiled a number of headwear products to showcase the industry's achievements.
If you want to increase your hat collection or protect yourself from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown presented their collection of large caps for SS19 at Paris Fashion Week, where they hope to continue their creative work.
This summer, Instagram is flooded with unusable hats, and designers have turned their eye-catching creativity to the catwalk.
The hat, made by Valentino, was a highlight of the invention, with a long feather frame.
Other large hats, such as the witch's hat, decorated with habbha and pineapple, were not designed to provide warmth to the head.
Tom Brown has also presented a rare face mask for celebrations.
Other facials, made in different colors, look more like Hannibal Lester than their lips and other items.
One invention looks like scuba diving, while the other looks like a cone-shaped ice cream cone.
If you keep visiting the biggest fashion houses, you're in luck
As many style fans have already guessed, many hats with a tie with their neckline attract the attention of many.
The wide hat, made of cotton and measuring two feet in length, was seen along the long hill called 'La Bomba' and was seen by many, from Rihanna to Emil Ratajkowski.
The unique size of the hat is considered the best innovation since the Cat Wak, which has attracted a lot of attention on social media, and a dark yellow bag is also designed as a swimsuit.
At the Paris Fashion Week Jacome, the Ravera SS19 collection is presented with a black orange strapless handbag, with a fridge top and a white laser handle.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see bigger hats and beach bags on the main street next summer - the designer has been so influential that it's hard to say there won't be a demand for these large-scale, exclusive uses.'
John Edward: Language skills are important for global citizens.
Private schools in Scotland achieved record-high academic performance in 2018, thanks to the hard work of individuals and teams in sports, art, music and other community-based activities.
The Scottish Council of Independent Schools represents over 30,000 students in schools across Scotland and is committed to providing the best possible service to students and parents.
The private schools are working with the aim of preparing their students for the professions and places of their choice for further higher education as citizens.
As an educational professional, modern languages have become the subjects of choice in schools, including their popularity.
As Nelson Mandela said: "Let the speaker speak the language as he understands it.
"Let the mind be one when you speak with the speaker of the language".
It should be borne in mind that we should not rely on English alone to establish relations and create trust with the people of other countries.
The languages that are most readily understood in private schools this year are those that have been ranked highest according to the league table.
68% of the students have achieved A in foreign languages.
Data collected from SCIS and focused on 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of the highest A-scorers studied Mandarin, 69 percent French, and 63 percent Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland recognise that foreign languages are important for the future of children and young people.
Currently, STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects are taught as a single subject in private schools and other languages.
A survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission found that language difficulties were the main reason for 17% of employees having difficulty filling out forms in job advertisements.
Therefore, developing more and more language skills for young people is very important for their future career.
In the world of globalization, language skills are important for most job opportunities.
The person will not be able to learn a second language in terms of the chosen profession, but will receive the same benefits that will last for a long time.
The winners of the competition are those who speak multiple languages to communicate directly with foreigners.
According to YouGov, in a 2013 poll of more than 4,000 young people in the United Kingdom, 75 percent were not fluent in foreign languages for communication, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage (15 percent).
That is why it is so important to spend money on teaching the language to the children who are already there.
The ability to have multiple options, especially for those whose economies are growing, will create meaningful employment opportunities for children.
In Scotland, there are differences in the languages taught in each school.
A large number of schools are teaching in a more modern language, others such as Mandarin or Japanese, with the UK language as the most important language for the post-2020 future.
The choice of languages for your child to learn in private schools, regardless of his or her preferences, will also be made with the help of specialists in the field.
Private schools in Scotland are committed to creating an educational environment that prepares children for success and skills.
In the global business environment, language is crucial to the future of nations, so it should not be forgotten that it should be included in education at this time.
In fact, modern standards should pay attention to "international communication skills".
Private schools will continue to offer diversity and excellence to Scottish youth through choice.
It must be done well.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Private Schools Council.
He will be brought to the Broncos for the first time in San Diego on Sunday.
A crowd of fans has turned out to see Bronson Jamesh play for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play the Denver Nuggets in the opening preseason game in San Diego.
But how many minutes he plays will still be decided.
"It could be more than one and more than 48", according to the official website of the Walton Lakers.
Lakers reporter Mike Truder tweeted that James could play for a few minutes.
Following the start of practice earlier this week, James was asked about his Lakers pre-season six-game schedule.
"I don't need pre-race players to prepare at this stage of my career", he said.
Trump's West Virginia support time, YouTube channel
President Trump's support campaign series kicks off tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five endorsements Trump has planned for next week, including a stay in friendly Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote to confirm the Supreme Court nomination temporarily suspended, Trump is planning to rally support for the Republican candidate in the November midterm elections, as Congress risks losing control of the Republican Party.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how can it be watched live on the Internet?
Trump is scheduled to leave the Wheeling, West Virginia, rally at 7 PM Eastern Time on Saturday night, September 29, 2018.
Trump's West Virginia campaign can be seen live on YouTube.
Trump is expected to address a hearing of Supreme Court nominee Rhett Kavanaugh this week, complicating matters with the candidate's alleged misconduct in the case, and the Senate may vote to extend the investigation by a week until the FBI completes its investigation.
The purpose of this series of movements is to enable the Republicans to gain the resources for the crucial November elections.
According to the Trump campaign, the five moves next week are aimed at "instilling sympathizers and supporters to maintain and expand the Republican majority in the Senate and House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Controlling Congress is a top priority for him, and as we approach the presidential election season, Fatah will be going to as many states as possible", a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The planned demonstration tonight at the Westbank Arena and the Howling is expected to "bring fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania together and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media", according to a West Virginia Metro report.
Trump's visit to West Virginia on Saturday will be his second in the past month, the first time he has won by more than 40 percentage points since 2016.
Trump tries to help Patrick Morrissey, the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate
"The president's arrival to help him gain a foothold in the race is not a good sign for Morrissey", said Simon Heder, a political scientist in West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder 2018 Team USA showcase belly for match giving hope life will be held between singles on Sunday
After a three-way tie, Saturday afternoon's four-man matchup looks like one to include in this Ryder Cup.
The hanging swingshow is entirely a product of sporting conceptual innovation, but one thing players believe in more than anything else is competitions like this.
So when do they say the peak is now?
"They were ahead by six points, now they are ahead by four, so I guess we'll just take that as a little bit of a jump", he said, walking slowly.
Europe has a better lead, but 12 games to go
The Americans feel they have a very slim chance of Space, despite having a high chance of surging, especially from players who have played together all day, such as Space and Justin Thomas, who each claim four out of three points.
Space is a killer, and he's been a leading example from T to Green.
As his round progressed, the cheers and shouts grew, and he used decisive and effective shots to tie the fourth game, with him and Thomas two points behind second.
The shot that won Game 15 was also shocked with the same scream, which is the kind of thing that makes you believe the American team is not out of the race.
"You really have to look at it and worry about your match", says Sepeys.
This is the main thing that every player ignores.
18 holes to mark
The only players with more points than Space and Thomas in the last two years are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, a record for the Ryder Cup.
The European grey but favorite pair is four out of four and they don't make any mistakes.
"Mollywood" Saturday afternoon, the only pair that failed to score in a single shot was Mollywood, who also failed to score in a single shot on Saturday morning.
All that running and the power that was being sent from the fans and the fans made it look like they would win the game on Sunday, no recognized player could beat the European because the sun was setting on Molinari above the Golf National and Fleetwood.
Preferably both bands at the same time but in different wells.
Although it is impossible to talk about the dignity of Europeans.
Buba Watson and Webb Simpson did a little work on Sergio Garcia, one of the morning's winning pairs, which paired him with Alex Nerne.
The Spaniard and the Swede scored in one of the holes he gave me before, scoring a shot they had never even seen before.
On Sunday, even if no one can help, get out of your own pit.
Two-pair and four-four matches are very interesting to watch because of the interaction between the pairs, when they are consulted, when they are not consulted and how the strategy changes in the moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and is the main leader on the final day, but as Team USA showed in a four-on-four match, they are interested in playing despite the doubts on the Stateside side.
Europe leads 10-6 to the Ryder Cup final
Europe will have a healthy lead going into the Ryder Cup final, which will be played in a double and a four-by-four format from Saturday, with the Americans leading 10-6.
The revived twins Timothy Fleetwood and Francisco Molinari have won two matches against Tiger Wood and extended their lead over Ascahoun to four points.
Thomas Bjornsen, on the European side, has a 3-1 lead over the United States, who were shooting from the field in the morning double, to avoid the trophy that Hazeltine lost two years ago.
The United States had a better four-four game, winning two games, but could not score enough to make up the deficit.
He needs eight points from Sunday's 12 singles to avoid the trophy through Jim Furyk
Fleetwood is the newest European boy to score four points in a row, and he and Molinari, nicknamed Molinari, are the second pair to score four points in their opening four matches in Ryder Cup history following a successful weekend.
After beating both Woods and Patrick in the match, they went on to beat the breathing Woods in a remarkable fashion and the American rookie, Bryson DeCamp, in a big and significant 5&4.
Woods pushed himself into two games in Saturday's game, missing the usual qualifying round, losing 19 of 29 games in a row and four-four and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who took a break from the morning's doubles competition, returned to the match four-four with his friend Henrik Stetson, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooke Koeppa: the world number one and third ranked.
Despite a pleasantly windy day in western Paris, what did Europe find?
Three-time major winners Jordan Spies and Justin Thomas set an example for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
In the tie, they scored a brilliant point against Spain's John Rahm and Ian Palter, followed by Polter and Rory McRae, who won 4&3 in a four-on-four match.[2]
Although the Fury only needed a goalless draw to avoid the trophy, it was only twice in Ryder Cup history that a team could come back from a four-point deficit to a single game.
Sunday's retaliation seems to be over the top, although it is the second best for two tones.
North Korea says it will "never" launch a war without faith
North Korea's foreign ministry told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions were deepening mistrust with the United States and that it was unable to stop its nuclear weapons on its own.
Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken positive steps in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests and destroying the test site, and pledging not to use nuclear weapons.
"But we have not received a corresponding response from the US", he said.
"We cannot rely on our national security without any confidence in the United States, and we cannot arm ourselves independently in such a situation".
Rem made the same usual North Korean complaint, saying that Washington was opposed to a process of gradual denuclearization and a reward for North Korea's efforts, making the statement seem necessary because Pyongyang has not abandoned its independent nuclear denuclearization program in the past.
Referring to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Trump, which marked the first meeting between the sitting US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore, Ri said that Kim promised to liberate the Korean Peninsula from the nuclear zone, while Trump said he would provide security assurances to North Korea.
North Korea wants a formal end to the 1950-53 war, but the US says Pyongyang must put its nuclear program first.
Washington has also rejected calls for the lifting of non-aggression sanctions on North Korea.
"The US insists on the 'first nuclear disarmament' and uses sanctions to pressure it into doing so, 'the other is to oppose the ceasefire.'"
"The attempt to use sanctions to try to crush us is a failed dream and the idea of deaf people who do not know us.
The continued sanctions have deepened the mistrust between us.
Ri passed without mentioning the US leader's criticism of the UN over the second meeting between Trump and Kim.
The ministry instead cited three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding, "The United States would not have been the actors in the denuclearization issue if South Korea had not been the problem of denuclearizing the Korean peninsula".
Ri's voice was markedly different from last year, but speaking at the UN, the General Assembly was held after "Mr. Vice President" Trump called Kim "the rocket man" who was the inevitable North Korean rocket target for the US mainland.
Trump praised Kim for his efforts to resolve the dispute, but said that many things remain to be done and that sanctions should continue unless North Korea gives up its nuclear weapons.
Trump said on Wednesday that he had no timeline for this, saying, "If it takes two years, if it takes three months, if it takes five months - it won't be a problem".
China and Russia are in a dispute over the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
But the United States Secretary General of the Security Council, Mike Pompeo, told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council's sanctions must continue uninterrupted and inevitably until the process of denuclearization is successful".
The Security Council has secretly imposed sanctions on North Korea to halt financial support for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile development since 2006.
Pompeo met with the EU's Rhinese. The General Assembly said it would visit Pyongyang again next month to facilitate a second round of talks.
Pompeo visited North Korea for the third time this year alone, but the third visit did not yield the expected results.
When they released Pyongyang in July, they said they were organizing their forces at different times, which was a sign of change".
During a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea said the United States should take "similar steps" to dismantle its missile sites and nuclear arsenal.
He said Kim wanted "same action" to ensure their safety, and Trump promised in Singapore to improve relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a class on getting enough rest.
"This year, all undergraduate students at Harvard University were trained to get enough sleep and to stop studying 'at night with caffeinated substances.'
The world's number one university, which produces the world's most talented students, was said to have a low understanding of its students' basic and how they see themselves.
Charles Esler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Birmingham and Women's Hospital, also developed a course he believes is the most unique of its kind in the United States.
The initiative to start training on the impact of sleep deprivation on education.
"Finally a woman came to me and said: 'Why has it been told me now, and not years ago?'
Aswa said that no one had ever told her about the benefits of sleep, and Ashu told The Telegraph that he was surprised.
The course, which was first introduced this year, tells students that getting enough sleep helps them perform better academically and athletically and maintain their overall health.
Paul Barrera, a professor at Harvard Medical School and director of university health services, said he decided to promote the course after searching for students with severe sleep problems during the week.
The hours of training are filled with many engaging activities.
In one room, students in the dormitory, students with coffee mugs, curtains, coaches, and the effects of caffeine and light, as well as lack of sleep, explain the decline in athletic performance, and the constant observance of bedtime.
In the other group, participants were told that prolonged sleep deprivation increased the risk of heart disease, stroke, depression and cancer.
The training participants will be encouraged to think about their daily activities in a way that involves everyone.
'We know that the behavior of students will not change immediately.
We believe they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know about the health effects of smoking, added Prof. Sessler.
The culture of boasting about sleepless nights still exists, he says, and sleep deprivation is a growing problem due to the use of modern technology and the increasing pressure on students.
Make sure you get enough sleep in a comfortable way; this is a student's secret tool to stop stress, fatigue and fear, and he says that for weight loss, sleep deprivation makes the brain feel hungry and constantly hungry.
The 19-year-old California chemist and physical biologist, who helped Professor Sessler design the course, attended a one-day class last year during his freshman year at Harvard University.
He said the course had made him open his eyes and encouraged him to take other courses in the campus.
He hoped that all postgraduate students should be told to follow similar programs and complete training before going to the next competitive institutions.
Professor Chesler recommends that students use bedtime and wake-up alarms and be aware of the dangers of blue light from electronic screens and LEDs, which can also cause heart rhythm disturbances and sleep problems.
Living Stone 1-0 Rangers: The goal of the manga disappointed the players of Gerard.
Rangers were defeated by Dolly Minga, who defeated Steven Gerrard 1-0 at Livingstone.
The Ibrox were looking to record their first win since a 4-1 win at Sanjunton La, but Gary Holt's side were weakened. Sherrard took his second defeat in 18 games, ruining the lead by eight points.
Menga was tired with seven minutes left in the first half, and the Rangers played well and with good motivation.
Now that the Rangers are down to sixth, the Living Stones have been relegated to third by the goalless Hibernians.
Another possible disturbance is expected in the Rangers' property section, where the linebacker was shot from another direction and injured his head.
Gerrard made eight substitutions in the semi-final at Betfred, which saw Ayren eliminated.
Holt, on the other hand, was happy to have managed to beat Hearts with Levi 11 last week, but he was also happy to have been able to worry his opponents in all games.
The Rangers were better at ball control, but the Living Stones were also seen to be better with the ball.
Minga's goal at Alan McGregor's knocked Scott Pittman out of the competition, and they need to score within two minutes, but he can expand his chances.
Caghan Jacob's strong perfect penalty shot came against Craig Halkett, who then threw a bench-up to his defender friend Alan Lytgow.
The Rangers were good at ball control and are more hopeful than they were hoping to win in their third game.
Alfredo Morelos and Steven Lawless faced off in the first quarter, but referee Steven Thompson ignored the Colombians' request.
Rangers attempted two goal-kicking shots in the first half, with former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly distracted by Lasana Colibri's cheekballs and Ove Ejeria's shock attempts.
Levi's 34th minute opening move is a game-changer, no one can deny that.
The Rangers lost contact with Jacob again.
Scott Arfield as Declan Gallagher passes the ball to Scott Robinson, who scores in a penalty shootout.
[1] Ferrard replaced Ryan Kent at half-time to make an impact, with the wing-half Merrillos immediately filling the gap and making more impact, while the amazing Kelly tried to defend.
But the Living Stones must use longer balls to play the way the away team likes.
As the Holtz consolidated their lead in the final rounds, Lytgau attempted to stop Jacob before McCrager began to attack from the corner.
Glenn Middleton, a Rangers replacement, demanded a penalty kick from Jacob after his abduction, but Thompson ignored him.
The almanac is the invention of the Geiger counter.
The pages are now from the "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882 Today, 136 years ago, he continues to count... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, which eventually developed into the Geiger counter.
The backbone of science is Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, scientists who made the Giger counter famous and starred in the 1995 film "Bells of Coronado".
Man "What Is in the World?"
Rogers said, "The Giger counter was used to detect the presence of radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you wear a headset, you can hear the effect of radioactive atoms in the mine".
"Well", Evans said, "it's going to break now!"
"Hans" Gregor died in 1945, a few days short of his 63rd birthday.
But what he feared kept his name alive.
The new cancer vaccine has produced an abnormal cell for our immune system.
The new cancer vaccine has led to abnormal cell formation and death in our immune system.
The vaccine produces cells that are essential to the body's immune system, which is part of the treatment.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient in the laboratory.
Then it is common to see the protein in many cancers and it is re-injected.
A vaccine being tested against cancer is showing promising results.
A woman who received the vaccine had a new infection and her ovarian cancer disappeared less than 18 months later.
When a patient's immune cell is removed from the tumor and transformed in a laboratory, a protein called HER2 is produced in many cancers and then the cell is targeted.
"The results show that we have a very promising vaccine", said Jay Berzofsky, a professor at the United Nations Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
HER2 "causes the growth of a variety of cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung and pancreatic cancers", explains Professor Berzowski.
The training in how to take immune cells from a patient and monitor cancer cells is the same as for treating leukemia.
Kanye West was following Trump's criticism as MAGA took the hat off after appearing on SNL.
It's not going well.
Kanye West was heard in the studio on Saturday night praising America for his performance in a live broadcast. President Donald Trump said he would be in office in 2020.
After playing the third and final song of the night, "Ghost Town", he took the "Make America Great" hat and said he was supporting Trump.
"I often talk to white people and they say, 'How can you like Trump? He's a racist.'"
Well, if I had thought about racism, I would have left America years ago".
The SNL show, which opens with Hollywood star Matt Damon and is hosted by Brett Cavanaugh, focuses on the Senate Judiciary Committee's sexual assault indictment of Christine Beasley Ford.
A moving image of Western outrage posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock and not shared by the media.
It's not clear to me that West is being tricked.
West told the audience that he had a hard time with his headwear behind the stage.
"I was threatened from behind the scenes.
As they say, 'Don't go where the hat is'
They threatened me!
According to the Washington Examiner, I'm in a stable place, as they say.
The Westerners continued, "Do you want to see a low point?" and then said, "Make my superman hat, because that means you don't tell me what to do.
"Trying to Find Love"
Two comments from the audience were noted, and SNL cast members were not feeling comfortable, with one individual reporting that there would be a publication: "Overall, the studio was quiet".
Western media has been talking about singer Ariana Grande's relationship with another man following the death of her ex-boyfriend and rapper Mac Miller a few days ago.
West, who had impressed many with his song I Love It, was dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West was backed by conservative leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: "Thank you for standing with the people, one of the most courageous spirits".
However, as talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted, West simply stated, "He's presented as himself and that's beautiful".
"But I would not choose to encourage a person by buying his music or his clothes or his "artwork" - this is, in my opinion, a dangerous way of thinking and spraying.
He is free.
We are too", she said.
Before the show, the rapper announced his name change on Twitter, saying, "This is the man Kanye West was known for".
He is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Dee Dee, Puffy, and P. Dee Dee.
Friends was called Snoop Dogg Snoop Lion, and Prince, a former musician and contemporary icon, changed his name to Snoop Lion.
The attack on the Belfast restaurant was a suicide attempt.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after beating a man in a Belfast restaurant.
The incident took place in Ballyhackmore, Pauls said.
The accused is expected to appear in Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The Public Prosecution Service will be responsible for the prosecution.
The goal for Game of Thrones is a goal for star Keith Harrington, who is dangerously masculine.
Keith Harrington plays a young swordsman named John Shaw in HBO's medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor said his patriotism is such that such roles make young boys think they have to be too strong to be famous.
Speaking to the Sunday Times Culture, he asks if there is something wrong and how we can fight this killer mentality of manhood.
'I feel very important,' says Keith, who recently married 31-year-old Rose Leslie, a co-star of Game of Thrones.
'I have a strong personal feeling right now, is Tugaar wrong about masculinity?' he said.
'With the problems we see today, what did we teach boys when we were growing up?'
Television takes on the greatest responsibility, especially in terms of masculinity, thanks to its masculine characters.
he continues: 'which are natural and which are not?
what is it about television education, about the streets, that makes a young man feel so masculine?
This is the biggest question of our time: How do we change this?
Because something is wrong with our young man.
As he said in his interview, he did not do any pre- or post-narration when the series ended next summer, announcing that he would stop 'war bells and horses'.
Starting next November, Keith will star in the Sam Shepard remake of True West, a film producer's brother-in-law who is a robber.
The actor recently said he planned to meet his wife Rose, saying he thought she was the best thing from Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife in this scene, so he gave me my future wife, and my life will be there from now on,' he said.
She played Rose Yegret in the Emmy Award-winning series Fantasy as the love interest of Kit's character, John Shaw.
The couple married in June 2018 at the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS China reports 14% increase in new cases
China says its population living with HIV and AIDS has jumped to 14%.
More than 820,000 people have been infected, health officials say.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new arrests were reported.
Most of the new arrests were for sexual intercourse, a change from last year.
Until now, HIV was commonly transmitted in some areas of China through donation of infected blood to healthy people.
But in such a situation, the number of HIV cases has been reduced to almost zero, a Chinese health official in Yunnan province said.
But year by year, 100,000 people living with HIV in China are increasing.
HIV transmission through sexual contact is a major issue among the LGBT community in China.
In the same vein, homosexuality was made a crime in China in 1997, and soho LGBT crime is reportedly on the rise.
studies suggest that 70-90% of men who have had homosexual relationships in the country may eventually marry a woman due to conservative cultural reasons.
Most HIV transmission is due to a lack of care in these situations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to make HIV treatment available nationwide as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxie Waters denies Senator Gop's data and explosion of 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theory' by fellow Gop's Mashlock
The United States denied on Saturday that a colleague, like myself, Maxie Waters, posted the personal information of three US senators on the Wikipedia page of the House of Representatives.
The Los Angeles Democrats have claimed that "extremist wing" websites and websites are being considered.
"Lies, lies and shameful lies", Waters wrote on Twitter.
The release allegedly included your US home and phone address: Senator Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch of Ottawa.
The information, which appeared on the Internet on Thursday, was posted by an unidentified person on Cattolic Hill, where a Senate panel was advising on the sexual misconduct allegations of Supreme Court nominee Rhett Cavanuh.
The leak occurred after three senators asked questions of Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pandit and Red State reported that the Committer IP address posted was linked to the Waters office and that Waters employee data was released, according to The Hill.
"This baseless accusation is a complete lie, Waters", she wrote.
"My colleague, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised by this false and fraudulent accusation, was never responsible for this information.
This baseless accusation is completely false".
Waters' statement was quickly met with criticism, even from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This is treason", wrote Fletcher.
"This shows that she does not have the patience to be a member of Congress".
They should not be ashamed when someone is criticized for a job he did not do.
They must not be reluctant.
They should not ask what the boy wants.
They need to be calm and peaceful.
Fletcher attempts to contrast Waters's situation with that of a judge who appeared furious at Thursday's rally where Democrats criticized Cavanaugh.
Omar Navarro, who is running to remove Waters from office in the midterm elections, tweeted.
"If the big truth", he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters' office said the fraudulent allegation "has shifted the balance of power and law enforcement.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed", he continued, "and will be held accountable to all members of our staff and to all for their destructive and dangerous actions".
Johnny England Strike Score: The powerless Rowan Atkinson
Now it is becoming common to see the need for Brexit in a new film from a British perspective and it will be the reason for the proliferation of Johnny England action: The Comedy Sleeper Contract, which originally debuted on The Johnny Show UK in 2003 and was revived on Johnny & England in 2011.
Is tang in chick going to rub us the wrong way about how the country's new export opportunity is a waste of money?
In any measure, pop eye, rubber face, John England is being reimagined for the second time to cook things: the sum of all that is shown is that it is for non-English speaking cinema audiences.
He is indeed a foolish spy, although he is a bit close to the clown in a mimicry and confusion: Mr. Bean's spirit and masculine touch contributed little to the opening theme of the 2012 London Olympics.
He first appeared in a now-forgotten Barclays TV commercial based on the Atkinson character, a mysterious man who travels and does not hug, sparking much controversy before it began.
There will be one or two good times on this new G.E. visit.
I loved it when Johnny England was hanging out with her helicopter, wearing a medieval top hat and helmet.
Atkinson's body is visited by the comic gift, but his entertainment is particularly drab and woefully lacking in depth, especially compared to those like 007 and Mission Impossible, which go beyond comedy to comedy.
The entertainment is aimed at children, not adults, and Johnny England's confused twist is seen in Atkinson's silent film, Persona of Bean.
The current recurring theme is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker hacks into a highly secretive network of British spies, exposing the identities of British spies in the field, surprising a minor spy named Kevin Eldon who is on the job.
The last resort for a proud and unstoppable prime minister, especially for someone whose political agenda is disappearing, Emma Thompson has done her best to portray the fictional Theresa May character, but nothing works on the script.
Every one of her intelligence advisers has been harmed in their work, so she has to bring a retired man.
That is, the confused John England himself, now the principal of a school for the rich, but teaching how to be a spy, some good bosses say, here in England, has a rock-like spy school.
England were again called to Whitehall for an emergency statement, where he was able to reconnect with his longtime and troubled assistant Boh, played by Ben Miller.
Boh is now married, stuck with a pirate sailor, and has a beautiful hockey stick and a vicky pepper.
So Batman and Robin are back in the saddle with all the Queen's strict espionage cases, and Olga Kurayelko's beautiful Female Female Ophelan Bulatova is back in the saddle with the case of the mess.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is in the dangerous hands of a tech billionaire who promises to solve Britain's computer problems, as seen in Jack Lassie, played by the wealthy Jason Volta.
England and Bohus pitch in for a hotly contested tour: set fire to a French restaurant pretending to be a host; embark on a luxury yacht called Volta to escape trouble; England tries to use a virtual reality headset to promote itself with the interior of Volta's house, prompting a rapid unrest.
All stops for the final series are definitely out, but the situation is generally similar to a small children's TV, as it is popular and busy.
My beautiful unadulterated thing.
And can't I stop thinking about the other John England films, can't the British film industry do justice to Rowan Atkins by giving her a role that suits her talent?
Labour denied that he was working a plan to work four days a week but be paid five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a plan to make the British work four days a week, but pay will be five days.
The party is reportedly seeking company bosses to use time savings from the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution by giving employees an extra day off.
employees take three days off each week, but still take home the same pay.
the idea is in line with the party's economic agenda and plans to reform the country in a way that benefits workers, sources said.
The trade union union union has approved a shift to a four-day workweek to benefit workers from a changing economy.
A longtime Labour Party source told the Sunday Times that the policy review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
"Not all at once, but the four-day workweek is a hoped-for success in line with the party's path to rebalance the economy in support of workers and the party's overall industrial leadership plan".
The Green Party's four-day workweek was promised during the 2017 election campaign, and Labour will not be the first to make this proposal public.
However, the hope for success is not being fully realized in the labour party.
A Labour Party spokesman said a four-day workweek was not party policy and was not being considered by the party.
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to make clear his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he would strip power from the anonymous executives and nonprofit partners in the polling stations.
Shadow Chancellor's plans make sense as current shareholders in water companies may not get their full stake back because the Labour government may make cuts due to illegal activity.
It also approved plans to include employees on company boards and create inclusive ownership assets that would allow for 10% of the share price of private sector companies, up to £500 a year in dividends, to be put into the employee's pocket.
Leedsley Graham tells 60 Minutes that John Kennedy's FBI investigation into Cavanagh may change his mind.
An FBI investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on the Supreme Court's nomination by at least a week, and the office's findings may shorten the question of which Republican senators will lose their support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 Minutes news anchor Scott Pelley asked Republican senators if the FBI could find anything that would change John F. Kennedy and Lindsley Graham's minds.
kennedy seemed more forthright than his friend in south carolina.
"Mrs. Kennedy, you are correct".
I was going to go to the hearing, I said I had a meeting with Judge Cavanagh.
when i called him after this, he said, "did you commit the crime?"
he was firm, determined, and determined in his decisions.
however, graham's voice seems very difficult or impossible to change.
"I have made a decision regarding Brett Cavanagh and accept potential trouble charges".
"I don't know what happened, Dr. Ford, but I do know this: Brett insisted, and Graham added, quoting Christine Blasey Ford.
and he couldn't confirm any of the people you named.
He is 36 years old.
i don't see anything new changing.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the annual Global Citizen Festival, a music event with a star-studded cast and an equally exciting mission to end global poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival brings tens of thousands of people together at Central Park's Great Lawn not only to enjoy the likes of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Sean Mendez, but also to raise awareness of the ultimate goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The global citizens festival is part of the global poverty project, an international advocacy group that believes that increasing the number of people who are actively fighting poverty can end poverty, as it did in 2012.
To receive the free ticket (unless you are eligible to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert participants had to complete a series of small actions or activities such as volunteering, writing an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or other ways to raise awareness with a meaningful goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is Global Citizen 12 years away from achieving its goal?
Is paying people to watch a show for free a valid way to convince people to watch the action or is it a case of clicktivism, where people think they made a real difference by making an online complaint or tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "engagements" from its supporters, prompting it to set different goals.
These actions have inspired world leaders to reassess their commitment and formulate policies worth more than $37 billion that could impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030, it said.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 work-related executions and announcements, and at least $10 billion was paid or raised in aid.
The team estimates that the money raised will affect up to 649 million people worldwide.
Among the key achievements is the Almi Food Power, a U.K.-based partnership of investors and innovators that has pledged $35 million to help Rwanda address malnutrition after receiving 4,700 tweets from global citizens for "Helping Children Reach Their Full Potential".
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we will make malnutrition and social inequality history", Tracey Ullman, Power of Nutrition ambassador to the public, told a live broadcast in London in April 2018.
Following more than 5,000 actions to improve maternal and infant nutrition in the U.K., the government announced it would fund the Power of Nutrition project, which will benefit more than 5 million mothers and babies.
In response, a FAQ page asks: "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
world citizens answer: "it will be a long and difficult road - we will fall and fall sometimes.
But, like the great human rights and anti-apartheid movements that came before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe, Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman are among the performers at this year's event in New York.
Russia could use its navy to "stop" energy exports: spokesman
Washington could turn to its navy to defend Russian energy markets, including the Middle East, "if necessary", US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke has openly stated that Russia's intervention in Syria - especially in the face of a legitimate government - is a pretext for finding a new energy market.
"I believe they entered the Middle East to seek power, just as they did in Eastern Europe, in the southern belly of Europe", he said.
And, in the view of the authorities, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability to ensure that its sea lanes are open through our navy, and, if necessary, to shut them down and block their energy supply", he said.
Zinke was speaking at an event organized by the Energy Consumers Union, a charity group in the US that calls itself the "Voice of Energy Consumers".
He went on to compare Washington's approach to the negotiations with Russia and Iran, considering that they were similar in effectiveness.
"The alternative of Iran and Russia's economic resources, let alone the massive ones, is to force and replace fuel", he said, referring to Russia's economic resources being solely dependent on fossil fuels, saying it "has a unique capacity".
The announcement came as the Trump administration is increasing its mission to export liquefied natural gas, the cheapest option for European consumers, to replace Russia.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which he "disagrees" with, making Berlin a "hostage" of Moscow in Trump's view.
Moscow has repeatedly announced that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 cubic meters.
The Kremlin has argued that Washington's strong opposition to the project is simply due to economic reasons and the justification of e-fair competition.
"I believe we share the view that force cannot be a means of settlement and that the opposition should choose suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting in Moscow in September with US Energy spokesman Rick Perry.
The US proposal has faced strong opposition from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The Federation of German Industries, Germany's leading industry organization, has called on the US to withdraw from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreement in Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply", Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts legislator Elizabeth Warren says she will "carefully consider" running for president in 2020
Massachusetts state legislator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "carefully consider" running for president following the midterm elections.
at the Holyoke, Massachusetts, convention hall, she confirmed that she was considering running.
According to The Hill, she said, "It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that includes the women at the top".
"After October 26, I will consider my candidacy for president".
"He is leading the country in the wrong direction", Warren said in a conference call with President Donald Trump.
"I am terrified to death of what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren expressed her feelings about Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in her criticism.
"We need FBI investigators right before the election", Warren tweeted on Friday.
The count released on Thursday, however, showed that most of Warren's own voters don't think she will run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters "maybe" said the legislator should not run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
thirty-two percent supported such a race.
The poll showed strong support for former Governor Deval Patrick's race, with 38 percent in favor and 48 percent against.
Another prominent Democratic candidate for the 2020 race included former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont legislator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, Associated Press reports.
Sarah Palin mentioned PTSD of Track Palin at a political rally for Donald Trump.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being drafted in September.
He was arrested and charged in the civil unrest on Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he is going through after he comes back, I can't relate to other families who are suffering from PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers are coming back with", he told an audience at a Donald Trump political rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his detention "the elephant in the room" and said of her and other war returnees, "They came back a little changed, they came back stronger, they came back with the admiration of their old soldiers and air force, and all the other members of the armed forces, that they had given the country that honor".
According to Wasilla Police Department spokesman Dan Bennett, he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on Monday and charged with assaulting a woman with a combination of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report, and possession of a firearm while intoxicated.
18 states, D.C. support pressure for new asylum policy.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a new U.S. policy that would ban asylum seekers from organized crime or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed a petition Friday in Washington to support a lawsuit challenging the policy of an asylum seeker, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sessions, the American Civil Liberties Union, complains that their arguments against federal policy in August were not made public.
She claims that her boyfriend and the sons of a gang member who raped her were cruel, but U.S. authorities denied her asylum application on July 20.
he was arrested in texas.
State attorneys for Grace said El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which have a large number of U.S. asylum seekers, are countries that face continued problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy has prompted a 2014 Board of Immigration Appeals decision that allows unregistered migrants to seek asylum as they flee domestic violence.
District of columbia attorney general carl resin said in a statement on friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be judged on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a ban violates that principle", said the court's counsel.
The lawyers also argued that the immigration policy would hurt the U.S. economy, providing a great opportunity and "essential leverage" for entrepreneurs.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to no longer offer asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
Asylum is granted to those who leave their country of residence because of migration or fear of persecution due to race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular community group or political opinion, said Jeff Sessions in a June 11 policy statement.
Asylum was never intended to solve all the problems -- the problems that people face all the time in the world -- even the worst problems.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in search of survivors
the situation was increasingly dangerous for survivors.
"I feel very stressed", said Reza Kusuma, a 32-year-old mother, nursing her fever-stricken baby boy at a safe house in Pali, a town in the state of Maharashtra.
When an ambulance comes to every lake with bodies
pure water is not enough for him.
residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, trying to save as many as they could from the floodwaters, while washing their belongings.
Hundreds were injured, and hospitals were buried in the rubble of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
Some of the victims, including davy harris, who suffered broken back and shoulder, lay outside the palli military hospital, where patients were being treated for small tremors following the large quake.
tears welled his eyes as he described the tremors that shook the fifth-floor hotel room where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
"it was not the time to save ourselves.
"I think I was in the rubble", she told the Associated Press, adding that her family was out of town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then it was quiet"
i don't know what happened to her and my son.
I hope you are well.
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "threatening" with propaganda ads
A week after a four-page ad in a US daily newspaper about U.S.-China trade interests prompted the official Chinese newspaper to publish, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American publications as propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump raised the issue of the inclusion of a Chinese Daily segment in the De Monnet Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, on Wednesday after accusing China of trying to interfere in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional election.
Trump's allegation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US election marked a new phase in Washington's growing pressure campaign on China, US officials told Reuters.
While advertising to foreign governments is common to boost trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a bitter trade war that has led to round-toll tariffs on imports from each other.
China's retaliatory tariffs in the early days of the trade war were intended to hurt exporters in states like Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, a former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China and U.S. ambassador to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
"China is now doubling down on that threat by publishing propaganda ads in our own independent publications", Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in the Sundays de Monregis.
"To spread propaganda, the Chinese government is using the culture of free speech and free press that the United States cherishes by placing paid ads on the De Monnet Register", Branstad wrote.
"In comparison, the newspaper and magazine stores on this Beijing street have a limited number of protest voices and do not reflect the real views of the Chinese people on China's troubled economic path, given that the media is tightly controlled by the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
China's most popular newspaper, Xinhua, refused to publish the article, adding that it did not say which newspaper.
Republicans are excluding female voters before midterm due to Kavanaugh's fall, analysts warn
Despite many big-name Republican questions about the sexual abuse of Attorney General candidate Brett Kavanaugh, his defense and support for him will be met with negative reaction, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections, analysts warn.
The sentiment is high, and most republicans are clearly already interested in pushing through the vote.
"We can't go back on these things", Grant Richer, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill on Saturday.
Richter suspects that the last-minute pressure of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) on the FBI investigation was enough to calm angry voters.
Women don't forget yesterday: they won't forget tomorrow, said Carine Jean Pierre, a consultant and national spokeswoman for the Mov On movement, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, as protesters marched peacefully in the lobby of the Senate chamber, shouting "November is coming!", the Republican Law Review Committee voted to push for Dr. Kavanaugh's nomination despite testimony.
"The deep desire and inspiration for democracy is about to disappear from the record", said Stu Rosenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, to NewsSite.
people say it is already up, and that is true.
But it may be higher, especially among women voters in out-of-town areas who don't vote often, even though they don't like the president, and young voters between the ages of 18 and 29.
Ford's testimony, which detailed the sexual assault allegations against the attorney general, was also previously approved by Republicans, and could be met with strong negative reaction from analysts, according to the Associated Press.
This has become a cumulative problem for the GOP, said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, as NBC News reported earlier last week.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or sitting on Kavanaugh's chair, it's about how Republicans have handled it and how they've handled her", Guy Cecil, director of the Priorities USA group that helps Democrats get elected, told the news site.
However, following the testimony of ford and cavanagh, americans seem to be somewhat divided, sliding slightly into the latter.
A new Yogov poll shows 41 percent of respondents believe Ford's testimony is certain or likely, while 35 percent believe Cavanagh is certain or likely.
In addition, 38 percent believed that cavanagh had either definitely or probably lied when testifying, and only 30 percent said the same about ford.
After Fleck's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating charges against Ford and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reports.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted her when she was 17.
Ramirez alleges that the attorney general's candidate exposed his genitals to her face during a party during her time at Yale in the 1980s.
The creator of the world wide web plans to launch a new internet to merge Google and Facebook.
The creator of the world wide web, Tim Barnes-Lee, is about to launch a new type of business that will integrate Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The tech giant's latest project, Inrapt, is a company that is growing on the back of Barnes-Lynn's open source platform Solid.
solid allows users to choose where to store their information and who is allowed to use what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Barnes-Lee joked that the goal behind INRAPT was "world domination".
"We have to work now", he said of the new type of business.
It is a historic moment.
The application allows people to create their own Google web-based data storage or pod using solid state technology.
It may contain contact lists, a list of tasks, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional resources.
Google drive, microsoft outlook, slack, and spotify all have the same browser and the same time.
What makes private online data storage unique is the user's complete choice of how to use any information.
The company calls this "data-driven self-empowerment".
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea behind Inrapt is to help make SOID accessible to everyone by bringing the company's assets, processes and relevant operational knowledge together.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform from IBM, contracted staff to work on the project, and a community of volunteer computer software developers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create decentralized applications using tools on the Inrapt websites.
Berners-Lee said he and his team would not discuss whether or not to introduce a complete change to Facebook and Google to fully prosecute their business practices at the same time.
we do not ask for his permission.
In a Saturday post on Medium, Barnes-Lee wrote that the mission of Inraptus is to provide business power and ecosystems to help maintain the consistency and quality of the new Web built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology created the World Wide Web, which revolutionized the Internet.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has become an influential voice in the free-network debate.
While launching Inrapt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Association, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm a bit of a cyber-savvy person", says Berners-Lee.
Bernard Van: Priest of the Victoria Cross awarded to Athol
The only Church of England priest to receive the Victoria Cross for fighting in World War I has been given a 100-year honour in his home town.
Reverend Le/Cro Bernard Van was awarded the medal for his actions on 29 September 1918 in the Battle of Bellingham and Lehoncourt.
he never knew, however, that he had won the great british war honour by being killed by a sniper four days later.
The gemstone was discovered by his two sons in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One grandson, Michael Vann, said the stone was "incredibly symbolic" and was presented exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning adventure.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his brigade through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense fog and under heavy field and automatic gun fire".
He quickly went to the shooting range alone and after hitting three of the sections, he rushed to the line of fire with "great heroism" and led the line forward.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was shot down over Germany and killed on 24 September 1911 - a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I knew I could never have, but something humble".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after a military parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to be part of the military parade", adding, "The true heroic adventure is being seen with the support of a large crowd".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead getting Peppa Pig
Think about it, they've been up all night watching Bellator 206 together.
San Jose receiver has 13 matches, including six in the main draw and will be shown live on Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face off, viewers in the UK were surprised when the broadcast switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were especially unhappy about the game after staying up late.
A supporter described the transformation into a children's cartoon on Twitter as "a little unhealthy joke".
"At 6 a.m. that content is not appropriate and should be turned into a children's program, which is government policy", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig", Abbey.
Bellator president Scott Coker said they would work to include UK viewers in their programming.
"I think when I think about the answer game, I think maybe we can fix it.
"But it's six o'clock Sunday morning and we can't fix it until Sunday, our time, Monday their time".
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when he was being copied, there were a lot of posts going back and forth and not all of them were friendly.
we were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical failure.
but no, it was a government matter.
I can promise you, it won't happen again.
We're going to reduce it to five games instead of six - just like we do a lot - and try to give the fans a lot of credit and go through.
It is a sad situation"
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'inferior' to sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but he was motivated to succeed.
"Everyone is like him", the 24-year-old says, "and I didn't realize it until I was in high school".
The first 4 Desert Island Discs radio said that speaking about gay rights gives others "hope"
he also said that being a parent made him less worried about winning the olympics.
The long-distance runner, Kirsty Young, took months off due to illness.
After being fired from Laverne's original program, Daley said he felt "inferior" to all teenagers because "loving both men and women was not accepted by society".
"to this day", he said, "those feelings of inferiority, and those feelings of being different, are the real things that gave me the strength and the strength to succeed".
He wants to make sure there was "something", so he doesn't upset everyone when they gradually learn about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent LGBT competitor and is using his appearance to urge more countries to decriminalize homosexuality at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia.
He said he was lucky to be able to live without -- -- and he wanted to give others "hope".
"I was surprised", said the three-time world champion, who fell in love with the man he met in 2013 - US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black.
Daley said he married his 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but the age difference was never a problem.
"To go through all this at this young age" - he went to his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - was hard to find a person of his age who had the same fate, he said.
The couple became parents to a son, Robert Ray Black, in May - Daley, and Daley said "the whole look has changed".
"if you asked me last year, all i would have said was, 'i want a gold medal.'"
"You know, there are things bigger than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
his father, robert, who died of brain cancer in 2011 at age 40, shares the same name.
Daley said he did not accept his father's death and one of the last things he asked - because he wanted to be in the front row - was if they had their tickets to London 2012.
"I couldn't tell my father that I was not going to be there for him", he says.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he stopped breathing and died that I finally realized he wasn't beatable", he said.
The following year, daley competed in the 2010 olympics and won bronze.
"but I knew that this was not my age to be playing: to be immersed in the Olympics in front of a crowd of fans, there is no better feeling", he said.
He also sparked his first musical choice - Proud at Heather Small - when he was rehearsing with him for the Olympics and still resonates.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson's status changed at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
Phil Mickelson of the United States will set a record for the 47th Ryder Cup on Sunday, but he will have to change his position to avoid a disappointing result.
Mickelson, who is playing in his 12th title match, was replaced by Jim Furyk in Saturday's four-match pair-to-pair series.
Instead of being a victim of the action, as was the case for the United States, the five-time winner paid for his time with support and preparation for the game by giving two to relieve his stress.
Even those who have never travelled to win never reach the tower he reached during his playing days, the 48-year-old is not suited to the heavyweight Le Golf National Stadium, which is difficult to find due to its overcrowded and uncomfortable conditions.
And if the field alone isn't enough to disappoint, for Sunday's ninth game, Mickelson will face rookie Tommy Fleetwood this week, who has formed a four-game winning combination with strong British Open winner Francesco Molinari.
The Americans, who started 12 games down by four points, could prove crucial if they don't start off with a strong offense.
Furyk expressed his confidence in himself, not much more to say.
"He fully understands the role now, if he pats my back and puts his arm on me, he will be ready for the day after", Furyk said.
"he has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's fantastic, he's added a lot to the team last week, and this week.
I didn't expect it to add two games by chance.
I thought a lot, but that's what happened and we thought we should go that way.
like everyone else, he wants to be there".
Mickelson broke Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder games on Sunday.
Never matching his personal best, his performance in the Ryder Cup game could mark the end of his era.
Mickelson has won 18 times, drawn 7 times with 20 wins, but his presence has brought the team something that is invisible, Furyk said.
"he's funny, he's confrontational, he's funny, he makes people laugh, and it's great to have him in the team room", he said.
"The young players are saddened to have played emotionally with him this week, it is sad to see that.
"It's more than just a game".
Europe's Thomas Bjorn knows that diversity will soon be gone
European champion Thomas Bjorn has learned from his experience that a solitary Ryder Cup match can easily turn into an uncomfortable journey on the final day.
The Dane made his debut for Valderrama in 1997, winning the match by a narrow margin of 141⁄2-131⁄2 despite a five-point lead over the Americans by then-ambulan Seve Ballesteros.
"Remember that we were leading wide against Valderrama; if we lost, we were leading wide against Brookline, and we won against little Valderrama", said Bjorn, after seeing the 2018 graduates beat the national Le Golf 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, in his mind.
so this story shows me and all the members of my team that this is not the way it should be.
tomorrow you will be at your best.
go out there and do everything right.
the matter was not over until you found their numbers on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win the cup, and that's what the focus is on.
I said it all at once - I'm focusing on our 12 players on our side, but we also know that there are some of the best players in the world on that side".
"I would never have benefited from this", Bjorn added, "pleased with the quality of the players in the tough golf tournament".
don't worry about tomorrow.
tomorrow is a test of personal competence, and that's another thing to do.
When things are going well, it's great to be with a partner, but when you're there alone, you're unleashing your full potential as a golfer.
The message you should take to all players is that, be your best tomorrow.
now, leave your companion behind, and let him go and show his best qualities".
Unlike Bjorn, his teammate Jim Furyk expects his players to perform better individually than they did collectively, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have combined for four points and three points.
Furyk himself was on both sides of these major changes, and was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before being defeated when Europe finally raised the "Miracle in Medina".
I remember every word, said Ben Crenshaw in 1999, when asked how he had gathered the players for the final day.
"We have 12 crucial games tomorrow, but you'd better avoid that quick starter, as you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medinah".
when the earthquake moves in one direction, only half the pressure is applied.
We've organized our line accordingly and we've put people in a position where we feel, you know, we're trying to work some magic tomorrow".
Thomas was given the opportunity to try to lead the fight back and faced Rory McIlroy in the top match, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, respectively, and other Europeans in the top half.
"I went with this group of swimmers in this order because I thought it would cover the inside", Bjorn said of his single selection.
The new German battleship is lengthened again
The German Navy's fastest warship was due to be commissioned in 2014 to replace an aging Cold War warship, but won't be until at least next year due to broken systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The entry into service of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class fastest warship, the "Rheinland-Pfalz", has been extended until mid-2019, according to a military spokesman cited by Die Zeit newspaper.
The ship was due to join the navy in 2004, but a difficult post-contract issue has hampered the fate of the Goo Goo project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class fast battleships.
It is known to have a powerful gun, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some stealth technology such as small radar, red light and sonic signatures.
Another important feature includes long maintenance times: the new fast battleship should be able to deploy from a domestic port up to two years away.
However, the continuous delays meant that the warships - which Germany said were meant to signal its overseas power - would be obsolete by the time they entered service, Die Zeit warned.
The ill-fated F125 fast battleship made headlines last year when German naval authorities banned its use and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time a navy ship had been returned to its builder since it was delivered.
The reason for the withdrawal is not known, but German media have cited critical "software and hardware failures" that would render the ship unfit for combat duty.
The lack of software was particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ship could operate with 120 sailors, half the manpower needed by the old Bremen-class fast battleship.
Unfortunately, the ship proved to be incredibly heavy, which reduced its capability and limited its ability to further upgrade the fleet.
The 7,000-tonne "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as the similar ship used by the Germans in World War II.
Alongside the faulty hardware, the overall cost of the project - including the training of the crew - is becoming a concern.
The initial €2.2 billion was reportedly raised to a staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6bn).
The problems surrounding the new fast battleship have become particularly important with the recent warnings of a reduction in German naval capabilities.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliamentary defence committee, announced that the navy was indeed "running out of ship-ready ships".
The official said the issue was increasing as older ships were out of service but no replacement ships were offered.
He said sadly that no fast battleships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class could join the navy.
The National Hearing Trust on the Secret Life of Nightbirds
A new study is being carried out in the Scottish Highlands to explain how bats use the landscape for their foraging.
The discovery is believed to shed new light on the unique behavior of the flying mammal and will guide future conservation efforts.
Scientists at the National Trust for Scotland are studying common and loud pipistrelles as well as brown long-eared and Daubenton bats in Inverewe Gardens, Wester Ross.
special recorders are placed around key locations to monitor the movement of bats during the general season.
NHS staff and volunteers will conduct mobile surveys using hand-held pointers.
Professional voice analysis of all voice recordings, repeated call frequencies of bats and confirm which species is doing what.
A life map and report of the plant will be produced to create a detailed geographic-geometric picture of their characteristics.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitats are most important for bats and are used by some species.
This information helps to identify the benefits of conservation activities such as greenfield activities and the best protection of forests by bats and related species.
In the last century, the population of bats has declined dramatically in Scotland and across the UK.
They are at risk of destruction of their nests and the lives of their people due to construction and development.
Wind turbines and lightning can cause hazards, such as chemical leaks and some building materials, as well as attacks by predatory cats.
the nightingales are not blind.
but because of their nighttime hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to hunting for food.
The flying insect uses a sophisticated technique to find insects accurately or to identify obstacles in its flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for over 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 protected areas around the country, takes the lily bird seriously.
It has ten trained specialists who regularly conduct research, nest inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation has even set up Scotland's first and only falcon sanctuary, home to eight of the ten falcon species, in Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway.
The estate's manager, David Thompson, said the estate was a suitable estate for them.
"We have a good place for bats here in Threave", he said.
We have old buildings, many old trees and a nice zoo.
but there is still a lot that is unknown about the lilies, so our work here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to thrive".
He stressed the importance of checking for bats before repairing property. The accidental destruction of a parent's nest can kill up to 400 women and children, possibly the entire population.
bats are predatory and killing, attacking or disturbing them or breaking their nests is a crime.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish Lillibird Conservancy officer, urged the public to come to the rescue.
"we still have a lot to learn about our bats, and I know how to properly count many of our species", she says.
Ronaldo ignored the rape charge as his lawyer prepared to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegation against him "fake news", saying people were using his name to "promote themselves".
The lawyers are set to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the case.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward, Kathryn Mayorga, an American woman, was accused of rape in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He then reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Ronaldo, 33, called the report "fake news" in a video call to his 142 million followers on Instagram hours after the shooting.
"no, no, no, no, no, no, no. " the answer is no.
Today's news is fake", said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner on camera.
"they want to use my name to promote themselves.
It is common
They want to be famous for calling me names, but that's part of the job.
"I'm a happy person and everything is fine", the player added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over Ronaldo's allegations of "unacceptable defamation of personal freedom".
"The player is seeking compensation for the most serious violation of his most recent individual rights, which is the violation of his contract", said lawyer Christian Schertz.
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel Room and Las Vegas Casino
According to documents filed in the Clark County District Court of Nevada, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly raped her through her vagina after meeting at a nightclub.
After the trial, Ronaldo got down on one knee and told me he was "99 percent" "good" and "one percent" "bad", Mayorga says.
Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual, according to the documents
Mayorga also said that she went to the police and had photos taken of her injuries at the hospital, but eventually agreed outside the courtroom "for fear of retribution" and "not to be humiliated in public".
34-year-old woman faces prosecution for continuing mental disorder and wants to break the deal
He was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United when he was accused of the attack, and this summer he moved to Italian giants Juve in a €100m deal.
Brexit: UK 'may regret forever' losing its car manufacturers
If the UK loses its world's leading carmaker after Brexit, it 'may regret it forever', says Trade Secretary Greg Clark.
Toyota UK UK told the BBC it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston plant in Derby if Britain left the EU without an agreement.
"We want a deal", said Mr. Clark.
Japanese carmakers say delays on the Brexit border without a deal could have job losses
Toyota's Burnaston plant, which produces the Auris and Avensis, shipped 90 percent of its 150,000 cars last year to the European Union.
"In my view, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of April, production will stop at our factory", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers have taken a no-deal exit from the EU as a threat to how cross-border business works, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, is shutting down its small Oxford factory for a month following Brexit
Carmakers say their main concern is the potential supply chain risk of a no-deal scenario
Toyota's production line is run on a "just-in-time" basis, so parts for cars on order are delivered every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 April without a deal, it could violate border laws, leading to delays and shortages of goods, industry says.
Toyota could not hold more than the expected inventory at its Derbyshire plant, and production could be halted, the company said.
"The plan of Theresa May Palace is to integrate precisely to eliminate border checks", said Mr Clark, regarding future relations with the EU.
"We need an agreement. I would say we should be happy not only with the opportunity but also with the success we have now, so we need an agreement that can bring that about", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"We want to maintain the highly efficient supply chain, as demonstrated not only by Toyota but also by other manufacturers".
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but warned that the increased costs could reduce the factory's competitiveness and job creation in the long run.
peter tsouvallaris, chairman of the united union at burnton for 24 years, said the members were very concerned: "as far as i know, once these jobs are gone, they will never come back.
"We have a clear and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU", the government spokesman said.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be extended again, says White House
Donald Trump told the White House on Sunday that a potentially lucrative meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be pushed back to another week because of his ongoing feud with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, Trump's aid and Russian ties, and the president's obstruction of justice.
Trump fired the deputy attorney general, but not fired him, to jeopardize Mueller's freedom, a rumor that has haunted Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had wired a recording of a conversation with Trump and suggested removing the president as part of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday, the White House reported that he was leaving mid-term.
Instead, there will be a meeting with Trump on Thursday, after which the United Nations will be in New York.
Trump said he would "prefer not to fire" Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a possible row with lawmakers, Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual harassment, confirmed.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation at Kavanaugh's request, which requires the participation of every member of the Senate to delay the Zibalo.
Trump's chief information officer Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "it's not set for that date, it could be this week, it could be pushed to another week as things are going on at the Supreme Court".
But we will see and I always want to inform the media when there is something new".
Some reporters may question that confirmation: Sanders has not made a White House press release since September 10.
The editor Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of "interesting" comments was not because she hated TV reporters, but she said: "I agree with the fact that they are interesting".
She then commented on the strong direct relationship between Trump and the media.
"The president has had more question and answer sessions than any president before him", she added, citing no evidence. "We have seen those numbers".
"There will be statements in the future", Sanders said, "but if the media has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States questions directly, that's better than talking to me".
We're trying to do that very hard and you've seen us do that very hard over the last few weeks and when you can talk to the president of the United States, that's part of the press release".
Trump always accepts questions when attending the White House or public meetings or leaving a public gathering with high-profile guests.
There are few press conferences.
The president is seen in New York this week, with a disoriented face before a gathering of powerless and confused reporters.
Health spokesman writes to EU staff at Scotland's NHS about fears over Brexit
The health spokesperson wrote to thank EU staff at the Scottish NHS and urge them to continue their work after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP has sent a letter calling for the UK to leave the EU in less than six months.
The Scottish Government is committed to meeting the cost of living indicators for citizens working in public services for the EU.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "The summer is over, and negotiations on leaving the UK and EU are underway, leading to a decision expected this autumn.
But the UK government was also suspending preparations for a possible dispute.
i know that you are going through a very uncertain time for all of you.
That is why I would like to say again and again how much I value the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, have brought valuable experience and expertise that will strengthen and improve the work of health services, and shape the patient and the community.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay very long".
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, reports Tennesseean's Mike Organ.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the corner line and almost fell there", Reed explains.
trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on a line of shelves before she was taken to Carreza for further testing.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris that WSMV has been released from surgery at Abercrombie Vanderbilt Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.
Harris also added that "there is no specifics on the type/size of damage" and that the state of Tennessee is trying to determine when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, making him the 18th tackler of the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be forced to pay higher stamp duty when buying UK property, with the extra money being used to help the homeless under new Tory plans.
The movement undermines Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on UK taxpayers
The house is holding a fund that will raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK - the extra money will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The move was seen as an attempt to undermine Corbyn's success in attracting young voters by promising affordable housing and targeting those with higher incomes.
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and organisations who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the additional money helping the government's fight against sleeping on the streets.
The higher than usual fee - in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher rates introduced two years ago on second homes and buy-to-let - could be as high as 3 percent.
The hedge fund expects its activity to rise to £120 million.
About 13 percent of London's newly built homes were bought by non-UK residents, driving up prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to get their foot on the doorstep.
Due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad, many of the country's wealthiest areas - especially the capital - have become "ghost towns".
The new policy comes two weeks after Boris Johnson offered to reduce the stamp duty to allow many young residents to have their own homes.
He blamed large construction firms for driving up house prices by not taking up land, and urged Mrs May to leave a stake in homes that could afford to fix Britain's "depreciated housing system".
Mr Corbyn introduced a series of planned housing reforms, including rent control and "non-destructive" evictions.
he wants to give the council more power to build new homes.
"Last year, I said I would use my prime ministership to restore the British dream - that life should be better for all generations", Mrs May said.
And it means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a new life here.
However, it is not fair that it is easy to buy a house for hardworking British residents, non-UK residents, and foreign companies.
for many, the dream of homeownership was a long way off, and the glorious reality of living on the streets continues".
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate wish is to run Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "final wish" is to coach Scotland at some point.
Scott, 42, is currently enjoying a fight to bring life back to the North-East side, who are three points behind the top of League One.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I want to play for my country as a player.
I've got the B Cup", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sports Voice.
I grew up with my father in Hampden, Scotland, seeing a lot of things as a child, and he always had something to say that would bring me back.
This opportunity can only come if I manage my team successfully.
Ross' replacements include Sunderland coaches Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic has said his name, which was formed after his previous loan spells with Barnsley and Ipswich City, would not cause him any anxiety at such a big club.
"My success is measured by 'can I get this team back to the Premier League?'
"Because of the structure and supply of this team, it will undoubtedly be included in the Premier League", he said.
"it is not an easy task to deliver, but i only consider myself successful if i can get the team back there".
Ross is only three years into his coaching career, following a 15-month stint as assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month stint as coach of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa to promotion from the Third Division, and led St Mirren to the Championship title the following season.
Ross said he was now very impressed with his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"Maybe it was the right crossing", recalls Alloa, who was taken in.
I truly believe that coaching is the right match for me, more than just playing.
It seems confusing because I'm well-educated, I've made a reasonable living, and I've achieved some reasonable heights.
but playing can be difficult.
you have a lot to deal with each week.
I've been through the stress and strain of the job again, but coaching feels right.
I always wanted to coach and now I'm doing it, it's a very comfortable feeling that I've had all my adult life on my own".

The summer heat wave has boosted revenues for struggling British liquor stores but put more pressure on restaurants.
The alcohol bar groups reported a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, but restaurant revenues were down 4.8 percent, the figures show.
Peter Martin, CGA business consultant who compiled the figures, said: "The continued sunshine and England's longer World Cup attendance means that July followed a similar frequency of events to June last year, except that restaurants were hit harder when pubs were up 2.8 per cent.
The restaurant business fell 1.8 percent in June, slightly below its July peak
bars and liquor stores have shown a stronger growth than restaurants that have fallen.
food-oriented liquor stores, though not as shocking as restaurant operators, suffered heavy losses.
people seem to go out just to drink.
"with well-managed liquor and alcohol shops, sales of beverages were up 6.6 percent for the month, food down three stacks".
"These effects will continue in the same way we have seen since the end of April", said RSM Paul Newman, an analyst of leisure use and hospitality.
W. The apparent influence of weather and major social or sporting conditions remains the most significant influencer when it comes to sales outside the home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, but the 4.8 percent year-on-year sales decline is especially bad in addition to the ongoing price pressure.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-based business operators and time tells us that the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August may have provided us with some much-needed short breaks".
T overall sales growth in liquor stores and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the process of opening new services.
The UK's beverage, liquor and restaurant sector sales regulator, Cofer Peach Tracker, collects and analyses 47 business drivers' groups with a combined operating income of £9 billion, and is an established industry benchmark.

An Internet ad for a breast-feeding device comparing mothers to cows is spreading rumors
An advertisement by a breast-feeding device company comparing breast milk to a cow's milk has caused an Internet stir
In an announcement about the launch of what is being dubbed "the world's first voiceless wearable breastfeeding device", the company Elve, a subsidiary of Dunn Mer Technology, has released an ad that includes an explicit music video creation that shows the freedom the new breastfeeding device gives mothers to express themselves.
Four real mothers sing a single song that includes a poem like this, dancing in a crowded pool of skin: "I say yes to my head, but you don't see my tail" and "These aren't cow boobs, they're mine, if you haven't noticed".
The trend continues: "Get it out, get it out, I'm feeding my children, get it out, get it out, I'm dressing my women.
However, the ad on the organization's facebook page sparked a controversy on the internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of messages, the video has received mixed reactions, with many saying that animal genetics is a disaster for the industry.
"it is a very sad decision to use cows to promote this product.
They must be pregnant and give birth to milk, just like us, except that they are stolen within a few days of birth.
The Elv's breast pump is placed in the caretaker's breastplate (Elv/mother) without the Huntress being aware of it
Another commented: "It is, as you can imagine, very disturbing for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise breastfeeding to mothers who are supposed to be caring for their babies?"
Another added: "An advertisement so advanced in its time"
Others protested the ad, believing that a woman found the single "too funny"
"I think this is a great idea.
I would have one if I was still breastfeeding.
drinking made me feel like a cow.
The announcement is somewhat unemotional, but I took it as it was.
This is a great product", wrote one.
Another commented: "This is a humorous ad aimed at mothers who use vacuum (often at work or in the bathroom) and feel like "cowboys".
This is not an advertisement that praises the animal industry or that makes it look bad"
At the end of the video, the women's group announced that they were all dancing while selling unknown suckers from under their breastplates.
The idea behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women who use the breast pump say they feel like cows.
However, the LV suction is completely soundless, has no ropes or tubes, and is placed unconsciously under the nurse's breastplate, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and use the suction to go outside.
Anna Ballarin, founder of Mazer and ECD, comments: "The LV suction is a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and outrageous start.
By drawing a parallel between self-identified women and dairy cows, we wanted to bring breastfeeding and all its ills to the public's attention, while also making the incredible sense of freedom that the new breastfeeding brings fun and engaging.
When the LV suction hits the front pages, it's not the time to start.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on stage at a fashion show of designer Martha Jakubowski wearing the product.
Hundreds of refugee children have moved quietly to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of detained refugee children has reached a peak, but the monthly limits remain relatively unchanged, partly because the Trump administration's harsh rhetoric and policies have made it harder to accept children with bail.
In practice, most sponsors are themselves undocumented migrants and fear that their ability to stay in the country will be jeopardized when they are approached to request a child.
In June, the concern increased when federal authorities announced that potential bail and other adult family members would be required to provide fingerprints and information would be shared with immigration officials.
Last week, former immigration and customs officer Matthew Albenz testified that the agency had detained more than a dozen people who had applied to become custodians of sole custodians of underage children.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"nearly 80 percent of the individuals who are surrogates or family members of surrogates have entered this country illegally, and most of them are criminals from another world.
So we will continue to monitor these individuals", said Mr. Albanes.
According to Shelter Worker, in an effort to speed up the process, authorities have introduced new rules requiring some children to appear in court within a month of being detained, instead of the usual 60 days.
Many appeal to an immigration judge for legal status through videoconferencing rather than in person.
Those deemed not to meet the requirements are deported quickly as a threat to safety.
According to reports from Shelter and the Center in recent months, the longer the children are incarcerated, the more likely they are to feel anxious or sad, leading to emotional outbursts and escape attempts.
advocates say such concerns are exacerbated when a child struggling with moderate symptoms of neglect is more likely to be seen in a larger area such as tornillo.
They add that allowing children to move to the tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends can exacerbate the stressful situation many are struggling with.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish invaders to leave immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem also called for Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country's war now in its eighth year.
mohamed, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that the presence of foreign forces on the syrian soil is illegal, a pretext to fight terrorism, and will be addressed in an appropriate manner.
"They must be released immediately and without conditions", he told the assembly.
The UN has insisted that the war on terror in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died and millions have been displaced since 2011, is over.
Damascus says it will continue to fight this holy war until it clears all Syrian territories of terrorist groups and any illegal foreign entity.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria who train and advise Syrian Arabs, who are mainly opposed to both the Kurdish forces and President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 infantry in the war-torn country.
He said the situation in the refugee crisis was good for the return and accused some western countries of spreading unjustified fears that prevented the return of refugees.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return of the returnees", he said.
"They are giving it the political aspect that it should have"
The United States and the European Union warned that no reconstruction assistance would be provided until a political agreement was reached between Assad and the opposition.
The recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish the Idlib Free Peace Zone, the last major rebel stronghold, has created an opportunity to push for political talks, said allied diplomats.
The Russia-Turkey deal has sparked a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a region of three million people.
however, the world body has said that the agreement has a time limit and expressed hope that the military action will target religious fighters, including Nusra Front fighters who are linked to al-Qaeda, who will be completely wiped out.
UN envoy Stefan de Mistura hopes a new committee of government and opposition to overturn Syria's post-war constitution and pave the way for elections will hold its first meetings soon.
the world body has set conditions for the participation of the committee, warning that the work of the group should be limited to revising the articles of the current constitution and not to interfere.
Why Trump Won a Second Term
According to the theory, Mr. Trump will win reelection in 2020, a time when many liberal conservatives may hope that his presidency will be cut short by a scandal and illegal actions.
Without a doubt, "the most dramatic and dramatic end to a presidency ever"
From now on, there are no visible signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the estimated audience for the largest audience time has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has a peak audience of 2.4 million, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nelson, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show tops cable viewers with 3.5 million viewers on prime time news nights.

money from the parliamentary race flows like a flood into the well-organized midterm elections.
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district is seeing a huge amount of money, thanks to its congressional re-election, which puts two incumbents in a one-seat race.
This recently re-established Pittsburgh suburb puts Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won a seat in another district in a special election last spring, in the race.
Lamb is running against another Republican incumbent, Keith Rothfuss, who is currently representing Pennsylvania's new 17th and 12th districts.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the previous districts had violated the constitution and had changed their boundaries in favor of the Republicans.
The 17th annual contest has seen a sharp competition for campaign funds between the main party funding units, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after narrowly winning a special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
That seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.

USL Salvador weighed the circumstances to punish China for its support, then refrained from doing so.
Diplomats said the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing despite some US pressure.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump had a warm relationship with the president, Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela, and had a hotel in Panama until his allies expelled the Trump administration team.
State Department officials decided to recall US diplomatic mission officials from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to their decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan, Heather North, a State Department spokeswoman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But the sanctions are only aimed at El Salvador, which received about $140 million in US aid for development and economic support, including drug control, in 2017.
The advisory sanctions, which include cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, could hurt the Central American country's high unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal meetings progress, officials in North and Central America postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting last year that was thought to have derailed efforts to prevent migrants from reaching the United States.
But in mid-September, top administration officials made clear they wanted the meeting to move forward, effectively holding off any sanctions proposals aimed at El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has now been selected to address a conference scheduled for mid-October, suggesting the administration's implications for the summit are unclear.
And the three American envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new strong messages or sanctions from Washington.

The next possible scenario is the report by special counsel Robert Mueller on the potential obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, which now has a lot of evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is turning his investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign secretly colluded with Russia to attack our election, some say.
If Congress changes its position, Mr. Trump will face accountability in person, and possibly ultimately by a panel of his peers, as he prepares to appear before voters.
That's a lot of ifs, and Mr. Trump is not suggesting that the failure of his rights in Europe is inevitable.

Rangers Graham Dorrance looks hopeful ahead of Rapid Vienna.
Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, believing a win over Austria will put them in a strong position to advance from Europa League Group G following a thrilling draw with Villarreal in Spain earlier this month.
knee injury prevented center Graham Dorrance from making his first start of the season until Villarreal drew 2-2, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard to bigger things.
"It was a good point for me because Villarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
"we entered the race believing we would get something and we came out with a point.
We could have put in the final, but overall, it was a draw, maybe a good one.
Maybe we were better in the first half, but we went to Galton in the second half and we were the better team.
As we head into Thursday, it's another big European night.
"Hopefully, we can get three points, but it will be a tough game because they scored well in the end, but I am sure we will get a positive result with the audience behind us".
"The last year was certainly difficult because of everything that happened between my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is something that feels good in the place".

The earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
Authorities say up to 384 people have died in the tsunami and earthquake that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the death toll is expected to rise.

Federal investigators are calling for the death penalty for a New York City terrorist suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Saifullo Saipov, the terrorist who killed eight people - a special punishment that has not been imposed on a federal crime in Hualalai since 1953.
Saypov, 30, used a rental car on the West Cycle Speedway in Lower Manhattan in October, injuring cyclists and pedestrians on the road.
According to the death penalty notice in the Southern District of New York, for the death penalty to be imposed, investigators must prove that Saipov "intentionally" intended to inflict serious bodily harm.
Both cases are capable of carrying a death sentence, according to court documents.
A week before the attack, the Federal Supreme Court indicted Saipov on 22 charges commonly used in organized crime, eight counts of manslaughter and one count of violating motor vehicle laws and causing injury.
The attacker, according to the researcher, "required long-term planning and preparation", describing Sapiyev as "extremely cruel and prejudiced".
The document of the case states that "Safulio Hablayevich Saipov has caused death and injury to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angeli, Nicholas Clevs, Heran Ferrucci, Heran Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagounko".
The five victims were visitors from Argentina.
It has been 10 years since the Southern District of New York last handled a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last execution in a New York federal case was in 1953, when Jules and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple, were sentenced to death two years earlier for helping to provide intelligence to the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were sentenced to death in the electric chair on July 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, did not feel any remorse in the final days of the attack.
According to police, he said he had no regrets about his actions and felt fine.
Sappov told investigators that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of the ISIS terrorist group on his phone.
Police said he was asked to hang the flag of the ISIS terrorist group in his hospital room.
he pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
federal public prosecutor david patton, representing saipov, said he was "deeply saddened" by the verdict.
paton said that asking for the death penalty would be an extension of mental illness for anyone involved in the process rather than a mandatory life sentence without parole.
The defense team of Saipov had asked his lawyers not to seek a death sentence.
Tory MP calls for Nigel Farage to be put in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage has chosen to move the People's Army during a Tory conference protest.
One of Theresa May's own MPs, who was the Ukip leader, suggested that politicians should be in charge of EU negotiations to hear the heat from aerospace.
Peter Bon March Burningham, the permanent representative, said the UK would have left sooner if Mr Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
Mrs May's challenge, however, is to reconcile the divided ranks in a profound way, as opposed to the main Tories who joined the protest against Brexit.
The key is to try to get the checkers to agree on a plan to prevent the Brexit, the rest and the EU from coming under attack.
The coalition said it would push for a deal with Brussels, and force the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between it and the crisis.
Mr. Bonné said the resignation meant leaving the group in Solihull to check on the checkers.
Mr. Farage suggested that attention be paid and that he be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
'If he was in charge, we would have left by now,' he said.
Wellinborough MP adds: Brexit is up but for checkerboards.
He protested against the A.H. as he said, "We did not participate in the World War".
We should have our own laws in our own country.
Mr. Bonn has ruined the public's opinion that has changed since the 2016 election: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain silent".
Tory Brexit leader Andre Jenkins is in November, reporters say: "I'm simply saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people".
the chequers are not popular with the people, the opposition does not elect them, this is unknown our party and activists make us get elected first.
Please leave the checkers and listen.
A message to May, he added: "The prime minister keeps his word.
Mr. Farage should feel the warmth of the politicians to say that if they want to win the referendum in 2016.
"This is a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political department", he said.
They were planning to betray Brexit and we are telling them today: we will not let them do that.
He added: "I want you to customize our political department, those who want to betray Rexit, feel the heat".
"We are gathering the people's armed forces of this city who have won Brexit, we will not rest until we can, we will govern ourselves, we will be proud of the United Kingdom".
Meanwhile, the rest of the march passed through Burningham for two hours before making its way into the city centre.
The group was released this week after activists' cries led to the Torywhite rising on Brexit banners.
Lord Adonis, the king's equal, mocked the conservatives on security issues, and they became worried as the conference began.
"These people have the IT system in place and all the technology they can have in Canada, because of the borderless, borderless trade", he added.
 is a complete joke.
There is nothing better than Brexit, he added.

Enway Nani Sues couples fight after a message from a caller
A nanny in new york city has seen victims of racial discrimination, and her mother, jella, has been labeled a black person because of the wrong message.
The couple denied being racist, and were forced to wear full clothing.
Lindsay Placebo-Flexman, a mother of two, was disappointed when she found a new childcare facility, while Gisele Morris, a black woman, first went to work in 2016.
The other black person would not be, but anyway, it was Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman who wrote to her husband.
However, she did send it to her husband, Ms. Ruth Morris, twice.
Upon learning, Placebo-Flaxman fired her mother, Ms. Morris, citing Nanny, who was African-American and the Filipino she was expecting, as the reason for her departure, The New York Post reported.
Ms. Morris was paid for a job and sent home to Uber.
Now, Maurice is dismissing the allegations of fraud, and we're trying to deny that she was originally hired there, but out of contract, to live in Gig for six months a day.
I want to show them, look, you don't do that kind of thing, she's in the advert on Friday, and I'm going to add that she's a regular.
The couple responded to the allegation that they were racist, explaining that it was reasonable for Maurice to quit his job because they could not believe him after talking to him.
"my wife sent me something she didn't want to say".
she is not a racist.
We are not racists, her husband Joel Plasco told an ad.
would you put your children in the hands of the one who spoke badly, even if you were wrong?
Your newborn baby?
Please come.
As a full-fledged, Plasco wife is only two months old and in critical condition.
would you leave like that?
"This is not a good thing to do", added the investment banker.
as the legal case is ongoing, the court of public opinion is criticizing the couple on social media, opposing their behavior and attitudes.
Paddington publishers fear readers will compare it to a talking bear, new leak revealed
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born after the book was accepted, said in the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in other people's shoes before it's published".
It is very interesting to learn about Paddington's great achievement.
According to her father, who was a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write a children's book about a teddy bear, he was not discouraged by the rejection of his work, and she added that the anniversary of the publication of the book was "MiraRataSweet" a year after his death.
Paddington, an important member of the family, added he was happy with his final success.
he was a calm man, and he was not arrogant, she said.
But because Paddington is real to him, this kid is meant to accomplish whatever you want him to accomplish, even if it's not your job.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Despite his invention and ideas, Paddington is always praised.
my daughter is dying and i need to talk to her on the phone.
She rushed the girl to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors worked hard to save her life.
"She called to say that she was very bad, she didn't expect to do it", said Mr. Ednan Laperos.
Huckabee must tell her that she will die in a few minutes.
and I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my love".
I will be with Kanchi soon.
I'll be with Candice.
The medication the doctors gave her to correct her heart attack is slowly coming out and releasing her system.
She died before him at some point, and that's the end of it.
I have to sit there and wait, it's a revelation to know.
I don't cry or scream, I'm surrounded by my family and people.
i really need to get together.
Mr. Ednan-Laperos, who is now grieving the loss of her son, was on the plane, but was forgotten by other passengers.

A postcard from a grieving woman to commemorate a suicide on a bridge.
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to protect the others by giving their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are handing out postcards on the Welsh Bridge and even phones for people to call for help.
Ms. Davis' son Tyler was diagnosed with depression at age 13 and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want my family to think of me the way I always think", she says.
Ms Davis, aged 24, from Leeds, said her son, a chef, was with Infectious Green.
"Everyone knows him for his smile".
his smile filled the room, as they always say.
before he died, however, he was convinced that he was in a dark place.
Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, sought his brothers after taking his own life.
According to Ms. Rhett Davis, "I'm constantly threatening to knock, and there it is".
Ms. Wright Davis created the card, which lets you tell people where to go and where to go, even if it's a friend.
Don't just sit there - you have to talk.

Brett Cavanagh's future will be determined by the FBI investigation
"I think if we can get something like what he asked for - the study is limited in time and limited in scope - we should bring even a little unity", said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that the committee was "different".
Why Mr. Cavanaugh and his Republican supporters wanted the FBI to stop the investigation.
the secret of their formation is time.
With only five weeks left until the midterm elections in june, as expected, the republicans are working hard, weakening in their efforts to find the man they want to be elected as the leader of the supreme court.
George W. Bush, who had called senators to support Mr. Cavanaugh, had worked for Bush in the White House and had met his wife, Ashley, through her, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases the results?
There will be an election in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats now sit.
Mr. Cavanagh's election to the Senate floor with a small margin is doubtful, allowing Mike Pence, the vice president, to break his prison sentence and be confirmed to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's destroyer numbers have fallen under Kim
Many North Korean destroyers fell to South Korea seven years before Kim Jong-un came to power, according to South Korean lawmakers.
Park Byung-seog, the data ministry of the Southern Union, said there were 1,127 pollutants since last year - compared with 2,706 in 2011.
According to Park, the highest-profile indictments in the narrow North Korea and China are the largest of these smugglers.
Pyongyang has not commented on any public comments.
Many North Korean defectors have acquired South Korean citizenship.
More than 30,000 South Koreans have been crossing the border illegally since the 1953 war, according to Seoul.
Many flights are also through China, which has a long border with Korea and is much easier to cross than the heavily hidden military DMZ of the two Koreas.
China is forcibly returning these traitors to their homelands, treating them not as refugees but as illegal travelers.
South-North relations - both at war in his profession - have changed in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to agree on a deal focused on denuclearization.
This comes after a historic visit to Singapore in February by President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, who also agreed to create a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused US law enforcement of taking a more aggressive approach.
"No deal with the US, we have no confidence in our country's national security in this situation, there is no reason to arm ourselves first", Mr Ri told the UN Secretary General in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", "not qualified to serve on the Supreme Court".
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the appeals court "hysterical" of Brett Kavanaugh and said he was not qualified to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi spoke in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I can't help but think that if she did, Pelosi would be hysterical, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee about Cavanaugh's actions.
Kavanaugh emotionally denies the allegations of sexual assault against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were children.
In his opening remarks, Cavanaugh was emotional, screaming and stressed at the time, discussing his family and high school years.
The committee criticized Democrats, accused him of being a bully, and organized the assassination of Hillary Clinton, which was orchestrated by angry liberals who were not elected in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Cavanaugh's testimony, arguing that he should not serve on the Supreme Court because he put pressure on Democrats.
"I think he isolated himself from those speeches and the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi is unable to challenge Cavanaugh, and Democrats have a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm saying that if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, but he's there to be tried, he's there now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is now a judge in D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that Democrats were concerned about the potential for a difficult, just government in which Cavanaugh would be seen as loyal.
he has heard that cavanaugh is asking for some of the supreme court decisions to be overturned.
"It's not a hysterical time, the defendant is expected to go to court, not as good as that", Pelosi said.
and women should practice it.
this is a fair speech, months and years have passed, and she can't find it without crying.
We cry when we're angry, and Rita Steinem is with me after 45 years.
"I don't think you're famous, are you?"
She continued, "I helped a woman who was an executive at a place where she was crying, but we figured out a way to make her cry when she got angry and started crying, because the person she was talking to might think I was crying because I was sad.
they were angry.
And she went on.
And I thought that was cool.
tears can be an expression of anger because you have not helped these people from the ground up.
I have fond memories of my past work, in a male-dominated office, where I found myself crying, a big woman with a scarf around my neck - a cold manager who always gently pulled me up the stairs.
"I'll never see you cry", he told me.
they never know you.
they think you are sad and are happy to see you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman, worked with Gray Hart of Colorado in the presidential race.
In , Mr. Hart also left the race in a business case involving a married woman named Boat Monkey overseas, and Ms. Schroeder, so terrified, realized that there was no reason to prevent her from running for the presidency.
"This is not a good idea", she laughed after 30 years.
There were seven other competitors in the race, but at the end they wanted one more player.
the white snow and the seven clouds, as the man calls it.
She said she was late to the campaign, was busy with fundraising, and would not participate in the race until she had raised $2 million.
it was a losing battle.
she learned that her fans gave $1,000 to the boys and only $250 to him.
do you think they have found your soul? she asked.
When she announced in her speech that she would not start the usual campaign, she was emotionally drained - you all deserve my support, fear of the system, so it is difficult to raise money and get voters from outside the representatives, and anger at sexism - that is what motivates her.
"You think I'm hurt, " Ms. Wright Scrooder called again to ask how the prints were.
You think that the XCLEX is my co-sponsor.
I reminded him of this idea, what they put on the scale.
Did she cry?
How a US-China trade war will be good for Beijing.
Beijing has a long-term plan to mediate the trade war between China and the US, and as the battlefield is cleared, other countries will benefit, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president, issued his first warning on taxes this year on China's key exports of solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The new tariffs hit goods worth $200bn (£150bn) this week, with exactly half of the tariffs coming from the US to China.
Beijing has always been a business, with the most recent tariff increases of five to ten cents on US$60 billion worth of goods.
China has vowed to free the US and transform the world's second largest economy soon.
to make Washington interested, but publicly embarrassing the US, to Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say that if Jing can play it right, U.S. arms trade pressure should be used to help China effectively reduce the two countries' economic ties in the long term.
"The reality is that the most difficult situation is when the rapid political decisions of Washington or Beijing are hurting the economy of their country", said Abigail Grace, a think tank for Middle America security, which focuses on Asia.

An additional six million people in the country are still in need of humanitarian assistance.
al-mowlam says that Syria will receive aid to build a new country.
But he said they are getting busy and cannot accept the training or sponsorship from other countries.
