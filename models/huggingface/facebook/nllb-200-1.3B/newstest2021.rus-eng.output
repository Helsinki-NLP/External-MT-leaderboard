Semilarski against prosecutor: ex-vice-mayor of Tartu will be considered on August 4
That means a decision on her is likely to be made in early September.
The two first-instance courts refused to hear Semilarski's claim, but in April the State Court accepted his appeal.
The Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the applicant on 12 December 2019 as its resolution was not within its jurisdiction as an administrative court.
The court's decision stated that the complaint contained a claim for compensation for damage caused during the criminal proceedings.
"The prosecutor's office and the district court should regulate such matters", Tartu court spokeswoman Anette Kreitsmann told ERR.
According to her, Valvo Semilarski appealed this decision in the district court, which on February 5 did not change the decision of the court of first instance.
Now the State Court will have to say.
According to Semilarski's lawyer, Oliver Naes, his client was unreasonably suspected of bribery for about two years.
Now he demands that the prosecution deny the false allegations against him and compensate him for the moral damage.
The reason for the complaint to the court was the statement of the special cases prosecutor of the Lyuna District Prosecutor's Office Margus Gross, made in October 2017, when Semilarski was detained along with another at that time vice mayor of Tartu Artem Suvorov on suspicion of committing several crimes.
"We remind you that when I was detained, the Security Police and the Prosecutor's Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the entire Republic of Estonia that the leaders of Tartu - one of the most influential local government bodies - are corrupt.
These public suspicions have been hanging over me for about two years.
And now, when these allegations and suspicions turned out to be false, the prosecutor's office does not want to say anything about it", Semilarski commented in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Naes, at the press conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework within which the prosecutor's office should operate.
"The allegation of bribery and sale was false, but that's not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia and Lithuania that at the stage of the investigation, state representatives must be careful in their choice of words so that suspects are not presented as criminals before the verdict is delivered.
The prosecutor's office is also bound by the presumption of innocence, which, unfortunately, was not observed in this case against Valvo Semilarski", said Naas.
"The public presentation of Semilarski as a serious offender and briber in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of bribery are still being ascertained is unacceptable, contrary to the presumption of innocence and unfair to the applicant", the lawyer added.
As rus.err.ee reported, former Tartu vice mayor Valvo Semilarski will not be prosecuted for bribery charges - the criminal case against him was partially closed in July.
At the same time, the former official is being tried on charges of knowingly violating anti-corruption legislation in carrying out transactions of particularly large size.
According to the indictment, in the period from 2015 to 2017, the former deputy mayor of Tartu participated in the meetings of the city administration more than thirty times in making decisions related to companies operating in Tartu, with the owners or leaders of which Semilarski actively communicated on a personal level in extra-working hours.
According to Gross, in all of these cases, Semilarski had personal interests, and therefore he had to withdraw from participation in decision-making.
Earlier, as rus.err.ee reported, the prosecutor's office had accused Semilarski of receiving bribes and violating anti-corruption laws in large-scale transactions.
This happened in October 2016, when he was detained along with another deputy mayor, Artem Suvorov (Centralist Party).
Then the prosecutor's office and the security police said they had strong evidence against both vice mayors.
After that, both officials resigned.
Suvorov's case later reached a court, which fully acquitted the politician.
The investigation into Valvo Semilarski's case is still ongoing.
The ex-soloist of the group "Hands Up" visited the Tver region
The former soloist of the group "Hands Up", and now solo performer, businessman and actor Sergey Zhukov posted a photo from Kalazin of the Tver region in his official Instagram account.

And most of the fans are going to go with the old version: "Sergey, the old version of the song is clearly 1,000,000 times better!
I want you to support me, you devoted Hands Up fans, we don't need a new baby.
Most people write down that they like the original, which was a hit at the time, more.

Any club that makes an offer like that will get priority.
Locomotive is determined to sell its star and make a profit.

The US has called on Qatar and its neighbors to end the dispute
It is necessary to restore trust and unity between Qatar and other states, says US special representative for Iran Brian Hook.
He said the conflict between the emirate and other countries in the region has been going on for too long and is damaging regional interests in stability, prosperity and security.
So far, the US has tried unsuccessfully to mediate a settlement of the dispute, which Washington views as a "threat to Iran's containment efforts".
Diplomatic relations with Qatar were severed three years ago by the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain.
They've imposed a traffic blockade, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorism.
Doha responded by saying that its neighbors were simply jealous of Qatar's economic success - according to the IMF, Qatar has been leading the world in GDP per capita for several years with a large gap.
The emirate is the third largest exporter of natural gas, the sixth largest exporter of natural gas, and the largest exporter of oil and petroleum products.

How the Central Bank 's decision to lower key rate will affect the economy
The Bank of Russia is expected to lower the key rate again.
It fell by another 0.25 percentage point, to 4.25% annually - formally another historical low.
Judging by the return of the short-term rate cut, as well as the tonality of the Central Bank's statements and updated forecasts for the Russian economy, the regulator is looking at the economic prospects more optimistically than before.
This means that the current cycle of monetary policy easing may soon come to an end.
"We continued to ease monetary policy, primarily taking into account that there are still risks of inflation drifting down from 4% in 2021", said the head of the Bank of Russia Elvira Nabiullina.
They are associated with a significant decline in economic activity, a fall in domestic and foreign demand.
The economic recovery, Nabiullina said, will take more than a year and a half.
She noted that after the lifting of restrictions due to the pandemic, economic processes have revived: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand have been restored, construction and production of consumer goods have expanded, the annual pace of reduction of transport cargo turnover, industrial production has slowed down.
According to the Central Bank's clarified forecast, in 2020 the economy will shrink by 4.5-5.5% (before this, 4-6% was expected), and the recovery growth of the economy in 2021 will be 3.5-4.5%, in 2022 - 2.5-3,5%.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised the forecast for annual oil prices to $38 and $40 per barrel in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Previously, the Central Bank expected $27 and $35 a barrel.
Finally, the Bank of Russia's inflation forecast for 2020 is 3.7-4.2% against the previously expected 3.8-4.8%.
The Bank of Russia's view of the economy is becoming more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the easing cycle, say economists on Russia and the CIS "Renesan Capital" Sofya Donets and Andrei Melashchenko.
For example, the Bank of Russia has been consistently lowering the key rate for more than a year, since the beginning of last summer it has dropped by 3.5 percentage points.
At its last meeting in June, the central bank cut it by one percentage point due to low inflation rates due to depressed demand and the need to stimulate the economy that was stalled by the pandemic and related restrictions.
Chances for adjusting monetary policy remain (at the next meeting on September 18 and until the end of the year), but the limit is already close, agrees the chief analyst of Rosbank, Yevgeny Koshelev.
The set of pro-inflation risks also points to the imminence of a pause in interest rate easing - disrupted supply chains, possible cost increases from epidemic prevention measures and a faster (than expected) recovery in demand, he says.
In addition, the Bank of Russia's subsequent actions will require greater attention to inflationary processes during the harvest season, as well as external volatility, which has increased against the background of geopolitical conflicts, Kochelev points out.
In any case, the key rate reduction will lead to further reductions in rates for the most reliable borrowers, as well as, perhaps, for mortgages, says senior economist of the analytical department of the Open Bank, Maksim Petronevich.
The rate adjustment will be less pronounced than the key rate cut, he said.
Rates on consumer loans may fall by another 0.3-0.6 percentage points during the second half of the year, mortgage rates may end the year in the range of 6.2-7%, does not exclude economist "BKS Premier" Anton Pokatowicz.
Average rates on deposits, he believes, will also fall - in the coming months they may fall to 4,2-4,5% (now barely above 4,5%).
They could drop further to 4%, if the Central Bank reduces the key rate in the autumn, Pokatovich believes.
The Centre Party promises to pay off all its debts by the end of the year

"According to today's financial forecasts, the Centre Party will settle its current debts and liabilities by the end of this year", Corb said.

Poll: Lithuania's ruling Union of Peasants and "Green" parties again tops the ranking
The Union of Lithuanian Peasants and "greens", which leads the ruling coalition of the Sejm, led the ranking of parties.
This was shown by a survey conducted by the sociological research company Vilmorus on behalf of the newspaper Lietuvos rytas.
After winning the 2016 parliamentary elections, the "peasants" lost the first place and for a long time the main critic of Russia in Lithuania, the opposition "Union of the Fatherland - Christian Democrats (conservatives) " led the way.
However, recently Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda, assessing the electoral potential of the parties, said that the Union of Peasants and Greens will probably be able to form a coalition again after this year's parliamentary elections.
This statement provoked outrage from conservatives.
The latest poll showed that if parliamentary elections were held today, 17.6 percent of voters would vote for the peasants, and 17.2 percent would vote for the conservatives.
According to Vilmorus director Vladas Gaidis, the gap is within the margin of error, and yet the ruling party has stopped falling behind the conservatives.
According to Gaidis, the news that their electoral list would be headed by Prime Minister Saulus Skvernyalis contributed to the sociological success of the "peasants".
This politician was first on the list of "peasants" and in the 2016 elections.
In third place is the Social Democratic Party, which is now ready to vote for 7.1 percent of the respondents.
In a month, it suddenly lost 2 percent.
The fourth is the Labor Party, led by Russian-born businessman Victor Upasskys (6.2 percent).
The rest of the political organizations, judging by the poll, can't get past the 5 percent electoral barrier.

Moscow authorities tell about the fate of closed landfills
In Moscow, solid waste dumps are still being closed.
This year, the authorities promise to eliminate the last.
Some of the 39 existing landfills in the region are being modernized into modern waste-processing complexes.
But this option is not possible for every site - many of them have become densely populated residential developments.
After the field is closed, it is put to recultivation - the field is covered with soil, degassing and infiltrate removal systems are installed.
This stops the chemical processes inside the landfill, so that it does not catch fire, produce foul odors, or poison the soil and groundwater.
And then the former landfill is left to rise up a useless heap amongst the surrounding residential development.
Why not make it something useful?
For example, in Ruse, where the renovation of the "Annino" ski area was completed just a few days ago, the authorities are considering the possibility of making a mountain-skiing slope out of the pile.
The site, which was operated from 1976 to 2016, has grown beyond the boundaries of the land allocated to it.
So, in the process of reclaiming, we had to buy up the neighboring land, which had been filled with garbage for a long time.
"A little while will pass, the field will "get used to", the fortresses will be built, and we will think about what we can do to make it useful.
The ski resort is right in the eye", - told journalists the head of the Ruse district Nikolai Parfenov.
Two fields will be renewable energy production sites
The "Torbeev" in Lubertsac and "Timohovo" in the Bogor district will be the sites for the production of renewable energy sources from landfill and biological gases.
By the end of the year, a gas-pumping power station will be commissioned on the territory of "Torbeev", capable of producing up to 8 million kilowatt-hours of electricity and about 0.95 gigacalories of heat energy per year, which will provide the own needs of the field - heat supply of administrative and production premises.
"Timohovo" will produce 72.5 million kilowatt-hours and will continue its activities as a garbage-processing complex.
And the Balashkin "Kuchino" training ground, which was closed after residents complained about the "Direct Line" with the president of the country, could be a museum.
"The idea was to create a museum of recultivation of the polygons of Moscow region", - said Deputy Prime Minister - Minister of ecology and nature use of the region Dmitry Kurakin.

Acting governor of Khabarovsk Territory, Mikhail Degtyarov, for the first time since his appointment, came out to the participants of the action in support of the arrested ex-head of the region, Sergey Furgal.
The meeting was broadcast on his Instagram page.
"Moscow hears everyone, so I sent you a temporary one, so that the region does not fall without power... I repeat about Furgal: he is "a" - my comrade, "b" - a fellow party member, "c" - I am very worried about his fate, the party helps him, delivers him products, Zhirinovsky knocks on all the cabinets", - said the governor's temporary one.
According to Degtyarov, now Khabarovsk Territory cannot remain without a head, so he was appointed by the decree of President Vladimir Putin to the position of head of the region, so that "the remarkable building (the government of the region) functioned, everything worked, the budget was spent on social needs".
The acting governor explained that he had not gone out to the protesters before because he could not communicate with the thousands of demonstrators.
So he's running a social media feed and reading all the comments.
On July 25, two protests were held in Khabarovsk.
Rallies in support of the former governor have been held in the region since July 11.
On the eve of the next action, Mikhail Degtyarov announced that he would leave the city on the day of the rally.
His procession was stopped by protesters and called to speak about the fate of the arrested ex-governor Furgal.
Degtarev had previously refused to go to the participants of the action.

The beautiful high minarets only adorned the Hagia Sophia
Once again, about the Hagia Sophia, there is a text about Vladimir Zelinski, that, they say, we should protest.
First of all, it's free to enter - ho!
I've never been to Istanbul, but it's better to go to the Temple of God for free than to pay for it.
Second, the Muslims conquered this land as honestly as the Orthodox conquered the Volga-Oks River Delta, the Muslim Caucasus (and built a church in Grozny) and planted apple trees on Mars.
God help you!
The Jews have conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans have conquered America.
We're going to give it all back to everybody?
You think there's no pagan to demand their own shrine, which is the place of the Tenth?
Third, the Muslims improved the building, invested in it.
That is, it is theirs, just like the factories and estates that the Leninists took from the bourgeoisie as their own property, belong to the Leninists - Putin and other nomenclature.
They've improved everything from the Kremlin to the Angara, so they're all rightly progressive.
The beautiful high minarets have adorned the Hagia Sophia, very much.
There was a stupid inkmaker, now a stupid inkmaker with beautiful minarets.
Fourth, there are no "Islamic" and "Orthodox" civilizations.
Some are believers, some are hypocrites, some are hypocrites.
A person who believes in the categories of civilization doesn't think.
That's the thinking of British Foreign Office official Toynbee, who is ashamed to think that.
And the believer has his place of prayer everywhere.
And always will.
A believer does not pray except where he is asked to leave, he goes to another place and prays there.
He is a believer and not one of the disbelievers.
We're the stones, not the rocks.

A Rwandan man confesses to setting fire to a cathedral in Nantes
A Rwandan who volunteered at the St. Peter and Paul Cathedral in the French city of Nantes confessed to setting it on fire a week after the fire.
This was reported on Sunday by France 3.
According to him, the man who was detained on July 19 was detained again the day after the fire.
He was arraigned before the investigating judge Saturday night.
After being charged with malicious damage to property, the man confessed to setting fires in three places - under a large organ, under a small organ and at the electrical shield.
He now faces up to 10 years in prison and a 150,000 euro fine.
The motive for the 39-year-old Rwandan is not yet known.
All we know is that he volunteered to help out at the cathedral and had to close the doors on the day of the fire.
However, according to CCTV, he left the religious institution 15 minutes after receiving the call about the fire in the building.
The fire in the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul occurred on July 18.
More than 200 firefighters fought for several hours for the Gothic architecture monument.
However, they failed to save the stained glass windows of Louis XII and the unique organ of the Baroque era.
The situation was brought under control only three hours after the fire began.
No one was hurt in the accident.
This fire is not the first in the history of the temple.
In 1972, a fire destroyed the roof.
It took 13 years to eliminate the effects of that fire.
The cathedral was reopened to the parishioners only in 1985.

Russian TV actor answers accusations of "LGBT and feminism propaganda"
The actor of the Russian series "Chicky", whose creators were accused of "LGBT and feminism propaganda", responded to the claims to the film.
The authors "understood the acuteness of the topics and did not want to offend anyone", said American Stephen Thomas Oxner in an interview with the publication "Pojem".
"I think it's a story about power and the general aspects of human life.
It has nothing to do with LGBT and feminism", said the actor, who played the father of a boy who dressed in women's clothes.
He stressed that he was "proud of the work" and did not consider it propaganda.
At the same time, the American added, he is frightened by the reaction of some people to the storyline of the series: for example, there was a case where "a man in a deep drunk shot the set and said that it was all untrue".
"Then there were a couple of times when we met disgruntled locals who didn't understand what we were doing.
But we were open, so people who had first come with complaints started helping us", he concluded.
The shooting incident, the publication explains, occurred in September 2019 in Kabardino-Balkaria: a drunken man attacked the car of the filming team with a weapon, after which he was detained by police officers.
Earlier it was reported that the public commissioner for family protection Olga Baranec sent a complaint to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Roskomnadzor on the service more.tv, which placed the Russian series "Chicks".
Baranec accused the creators of the series of "propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships and feminism", drawing attention to the fact that the film's main characters work as prostitutes, and the series itself contains "scenes of physical and psychological violence".
The Ombudsman was also outraged that "the series has given a lot of attention to the homosexual sexual orientation" of the minor character.
The comedy drama "Chicky" tells the story of three prostitutes who start a new life and open a business on the advice of a friend.
