U.S. Navy Deputy Secretary of Operations Gen. William Moran said that even as the U.S. Navy is resuming its forces to respond to increasingly worrying Russia on both sides of the Atlantic, the U.S. continues to focus on the Asia-Pacific region — the Pentagon’s expansion of the region to include the Indian Ocean, Asia-Pacific — as a naval focus.
According to the British Defense Weekly website on September 24, the United States listed China and Russia as strategic competitors in the new defense strategy announced at the beginning of the year.
Since then, the U.S. Navy has resumed its Second Fleet in order to confront Russia more directly.
The move has raised some doubts and concerns among allies and analysts who fear the U.S. Navy may be distant from the Obama administration’s “re-balance” strategy.
But Colonel Moran said the U.S. Navy remains focused on the western Pacific.
On January 24, 2018, at the roundtable in Washington hosted by the National Agency for Asian Research, he said: “There has been no major change for us.”
Moran said: “The focus remains on re-balancing, shifting gravity, or whatever you want to describe it.”
However, he acknowledged that the United States has close relations with Europe.
He said: “We will continue to keep an eye on the growth of the West Coast and balance what we can do.”
While Moran pointed out that the overall policy on Russia falls within the scope of the U.S. Defense Secretary’s mandate, he warned: “The Russians may face demographic and economic challenges, but history has proven that if we conflict with them, they will be very tough.”
As part of the U.S. resumption against Russia, China, and other competitors, the U.S. Navy is dynamically deploying troops in a “new mode of operation” that will help the opponent get away with U.S. aircraft carrier battle groups or other assets where they will be deployed at any particular time and place.
“Our Navy and Marine Corps support it—the concept of unpredictability in combat, not appearing in the same place over and over again, almost as if it were a thread—this is our practice.”
The first to try this new approach was the Harry Truman aircraft carrier battle group, which was deployed early on including working visits to ports and patrol in areas usually only passed by.
Moran said the U.S. Navy is currently working to ensure allies are aware that these warships will still be on traditional regional patrol, and are also addressing logistics and family connections issues for the new deployment procedures.
Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Australian Navy, Lieutenant-General Michael Nunn, also spoke at the event, saying the Australian military could work seamlessly with U.S. aircraft carrier combat groups.
This will continue, he said, as the Royal Australian Navy plans to purchase nine more ships equipped with the Zeus Shield operational system.
Several airlines will increase or restore fuel supplementary charges from October 5 for flights starting Friday.

Since June 5, 2018, several airlines such as China Airways, East Airlines, Shipping, Shanghai Airways, Shenzhen Airways, Shenzhen Airways, Western Airways, Okay Airways and other airlines have resumed the charge of domestic fuel supplementary fees for routes that have been cancelled for 3 years, charging the standard of 10 yuan per person.
This time, Chongqing Airlines and Okay Airlines were the first to announce the increase in fuel supplementary fees, and at the end of the press release, there has been no news of the domestic 4 major airlines announcing to follow up with the adjustment.
According to the Hong Kong Civil Aviation Administration, airlines can decide on their own whether or not to charge a fuel surcharge from November.
At the beginning of September 27, Air Thailand announced that it would recover the fuel surcharge from November 2.
All air tickets issued or re-issued on or after November 2 will include fuel supplementary fees, long-distance flights to Hong Kong and the Southwest Pacific region, North America, Europe, the Middle East and India region, Africa, fuel supplementary fees of 652 yuan, short-distance flights will charge 146 yuan.

Japan's investors lost $1.3 billion on China's Citi shares on Friday, depreciating its largest corporate investment transaction due to trade tensions between China and the United States.
In May 2016, in Tokyo, Japan, a man walked through the headquarters of the company.
He said the trade war hit the U.S. grain sector, which has suspended financial transactions in agriculture.
Previously, some Japanese heavy equipment manufacturers, telecommunications companies and others had issued warnings about the impact of China-U.S. trade friction when announcing the latest results, and now these Japanese trade companies are also joining this line.
The United States and China have mutually imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other's goods, and U.S. President Trump has threatened that if the dispute is not resolved, the scope of the tariffs will be expanded to all over $50 billion of Chinese imports to the United States.
Tsuyoshi Hachimura, Chief Financial Officer for Commerce, said the impact of the trade dispute on China’s economy could be even greater next year.
Itō Liang and the Thai Bhai Group invested $10 billion in Zinc in 2015 and acquired a 20% stake in it.
Hachimura said that Itō Feng shares accounted for a loss of 1.43.3 billion yen ($1.3 billion) on this share because it believes that the price of the shares will not recover in the near future.
The companyins its profit forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019 at 50 billion yen.
China imposed a 25% import tariff on U.S. soybeans in July to counter Washington's measures in the trade friction.
“Our grain business has been hit by U.S.-China trade frictions,” said Yepu Yongxiang, chief financial officer of the company.
He said the company has stopped financial transactions on its own account since September.
Goldman Sachs spokesman Pat Burke said in a statement on Friday that the move was “under internal policy constraints and due to a lack of market opportunities.”
He also said the suspension of financial transactions would not lead to a decrease in employment.
The companyins an annual profit forecast of 23 billion yen and is supported by its pulp and papermaking and power generation operations.
Inhabitants Business announced a 16% profit increase between April and September on Thursday, stressing that "US-China trade issues have led to uncertain prospects."
Mitsubishi Inc on Friday raised its annual profit forecast to a record level, attributed to increased coal production and rising commodity prices such as oil and coal.
Mitsubishi also announced a new business plan, which aims to increase its profit for the fiscal year as of March 31, 2022 from the estimated 64 billion yen this year to 9 billion yen (79,8 billion dollars).
On November 5, a comprehensive report that the U.S. midterm election vote has entered the reverse counting time.
On November 4, President Trump and his Democratic opponents actively “hightened votes” to their core voters.
Both major parties pointed out that the voting rate will be the key to right-wing elections.
According to reports, 48 hours before the U.S. popular vote, Trump was busy attending the campaign for Republican candidates, while former President Barack Obama went to Indiana to stand for Democratic Federal Senate candidate Joe Donnelly, who was eager to vote, and shouted to the crowd for the final appeal before the election.
On November 4, Trump arrived in Mayang, Georgia for Republican governor candidate Brian Kemp’s stand, saying: “Tuesday you have to go to the polling station, you have to vote.”
“This election contrast could not be more clear.”
Voters’ political enthusiasm has risen to a rare peak, with early voting far beyond usual in some states.
A former U.S. president faces the first midterm election, and the seats in Congress of the party he belongs to are often reduced.
According to a new poll released by the Washington Post and ABC News, while Democrats remain in the House of Representatives, Republicans can benefit from economic assessments and Trump’s strict attention to border security.
The polls show that registered voters prefer Democratic House candidates more than Republicans, with a proportion of 50 percent to 43 percent, but still down from August’s leading 14 percentage points.
Another poll conducted by National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) and the Wall Street Journal also showed that Democrats are still seven percentage points ahead of Republicans.
In a speech to the masses, Mr. Obama said: “When people don’t say the truth, when words no longer represent anything, then there will inevitably be bad results.
Democracy cannot work when people lie only in despair.”
“The only way to stop these Republicans’ behavior now is by you and your votes.”
Democrats face the toughest election in decades in the Senate, with Republicans currently holding over half of the 51 seats.
But the House of Representatives is more favorable, with Democrats having to win 23 seats to control the House of Representatives, which has 435 seats.
Analysts at FiveThirtyEight.com predict that the Democratic party has an 85 percent chance of winning the House of Representatives.

In order to study deeply and implement the socialist thought with Chinese characteristics of Xi Jinping in the new era and the spirit of the nineteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the National Political and Political Council system began in May to carry out the important ideas and study seminars of General Secretary Xi Jinping on strengthening and improving the work of the People's Political and Political Council of China, held eight district seminars and seven expert academic seminars, identified 18 key topics and six basic theoretical topics, a total of 79,38 million members of the Political and Political Council of China at all levels, and 27,9 million cadres of organs participated in study and study, and formed more than 3,6 million research papers.
In the current wave of "massive entrepreneurship, innovation", more and more technology companies have begun to attach importance to patent research and development and related protection work, deepen the potential value of patents, and occupy the dominance of the market.
Similarly, there are many scientific and technological enterprises that have suffered a wave of infringement in terms of patent technology licensing and patent technology use.
At the end of 2017, Tammyuan, Ho Chi Minh, and Rabin three people from Guangdong province on the basis of patent infringement, the developer of the "Digit Travel" APP, Beijing Oranje Technology Co., Ltd (hereinafter referred to as Oranje Technology Co., Ltd.), the operator of Digit Travel Technology Co., Ltd (hereinafter referred to as Digit Travel Co., Ltd.) and the seller of Guangdong Pacific Internet Information Services Co., Ltd (hereinafter referred to as Guangdong Pacific) appealed to the intellectual property court of Guangzhou.
The three plaintiffs requested a court order that the three defendants immediately cease to manufacture, sell, promise to sell and use the plaintiff's patent.
On October 30, 2018, China's Arbitration Document Network published the "Primary Civil Decree on Infringement of Invention Patent Rights Disputes with Beijing's Little Orange Technology Co., Ltd." , Disclosing the details of some cases of alleged patent infringement.
Three plaintiffs believe that the patent holder and inventor of the patent "based on the mobile terminal car service system and method", while the entire operating process of the application of the "Dip-Dip-Dip" app corresponds to the technical solution for patent protection in the case, constituting patent infringement.
However, during the court ruling, Xiao Yan Technologies believed that Guangdong Pacific was not a suitable defendant, which only provided free download of the case-related APP "Drop Drop" on the network, did not implement the case-related patent method, there is no direct or indirect infringement, and should not be listed as the defendant in this case.
Second, the infringement in this case is not in Guangzhou.
In accordance with the provisions of the law, the place of infringement of the patent in question should be the place where the patent method in question is fully implemented, so the court's jurisdiction was objected to, and the case was transferred to the court of the place of residence of the defendant, Beijing Intellectual Property Court for trial.
The Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court believes that the defendant Guangdong Pacific on its network platform provided alleged infringement app products, the plaintiff listed the defendant Guangdong Pacific as the defendant is not inappropriate.
The defendant is domiciled in Guangzhou City, Guangzhou, within the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The defendant argued that the case would be transferred to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court for trial, based on insufficient grounds, and rejected the defendant's objection to the jurisdiction of the case, and will bear the costs of accepting the case.
Other cases of the case have not yet been announced, and reporters will also closely follow up on the subsequent details of the patent infringement case.
Interview with the Chief Executive of the Australian Federal Scientific and Industrial Research Organization: China-Australia scientific and technological cooperation achieves remarkable results
"China's science and technology has developed rapidly in the last few decades, and the two countries can work together in the field of science to fruitful results."
Larry Marshall, chief executive of the Australian Federal Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, said in an interview with reporters in Beijing that China's cooperation in the field of science and technology has shown a vibrant momentum from tackling climate change to cooperation in the "Sky Eye" project.
As the largest national research institution in the Australian Federation, CSIRO has achieved a number of world-renowned innovative research achievements in the fields of ocean, energy, biology, materials, astronomy and more.
CSIRO hasined close cooperation with research institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
“It’s a lasting friendship that includes a tradition of trust in the partner and long-term cooperation,” Marshall said.
In May this year, China's 500-metre-caliber spherical radio telescope - "China Sky Eye" installed the first international 19-wave L-band receiver.
This is currently the most advanced 19 wave input receiver internationally, developed jointly by Chinese and Australian scientists.
Marshall said that the successful development of the receiver is based on CSIRO's years of technology accumulation, and that when enabled, the FAST cruise speed will increase five to six times, while also expanding more scientific observation targets.
“This is a force of CSIRO’s contribution to FAST.”
In addition to the above cooperation, CSIRO also has a close cooperation with Chinese research institutions in the construction of square-kilometre array radio telescopes, the development of new fuel technologies, energy saving and emissions reduction.
“Scientific research in the past is often focused on problems centuries later, and now more research power is needed to solve the problems before.”
Marshall believes that Australia and China are complementary in the field of scientific development, while both countries face a series of challenges in development.
For example, extreme weather is frequent across the globe, with droughts and floods leading to food production cuts, and food shortages severely affecting human development.
At the same time, demographic explosion, ageing, and chronic diseases are also serious challenges.
"The cooperation between the two countries in recent years has primarily focused on solving these difficulties."
Marshall said that CSIRO and the National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology of Qingdao jointly built the International Oceanic Research Center of the Southern Hemisphere, which focuses on observing the El Niño and Lannina phenomena, studying the relationship between the two and extreme weather, and establishing early warning facilities for extreme weather; CSIRO and the Institute of Chinese Sciences jointly developed new varieties of cereals to overcome extreme weather, can also mitigate the food shortages caused by extreme weather.
“In the current environment, scientific and technological innovation is difficult to accomplish alone, it requires extremely high costs, and there are many problems to be solved, so cooperation is important today.”
Marshall said that the closer the cooperation, the more likely it is to breakthrough progress, which is also the significance of enhancing cooperation between the two sides in the framework of the Belt and Road.
“Strengthening bilateral cooperation, for us, is mainly scientific and technological cooperation.”
Marshall, for example, said that CSIRO recently developed a gold purification method without the use of potassium, because the traditional gold purification method of potassium gold purification is very dangerous to the environment, many countries hope to find a gold purification method that pollutes the environment.
“We are eager to introduce this technology to China, which is one of the outcomes of our participation in Belt and Road cooperation.”

North Korea's Foreign Minister, Li Jinhua, told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued implementation of sanctions deepens North Korea's distrust of the United States, and North Korea cannot unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Li said at the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea has taken "very friendly approach" over the past year, including stopping missile and nuclear tests, demolishing a nuclear test site, and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology.
“But we haven’t seen any corresponding response from the United States,” he said.
“There is no confidence in our national security if we do not trust the United States, and in such a case we cannot unilaterally give up weapons.”
While Li is repeating North Korea’s complaints about U.S. opposition to “stage-by-stage” denuclearization, his speech is significant because it hasn’t completely rejected unilateral denuclearization like North Korea did before.
Li Jinhai referred to the joint statement by Kim and Trump on June 12, when Kim agreed to efforts to “denuclearise” the Korean Peninsula, while Trump pledged to protect North Korea’s security.
North Korea has always sought to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says North Korea must give up its nuclear weapons first.
The United States has also rejected the demands for easing international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘nuclearization first’ and increases sanctions pressure to its goals in a high-pressure manner, and even refuses to issue a ‘declaration of end to war’,” Li said.
“The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees and ask for forgiveness is that we don’t understand the people we are dreaming.
But the problem is that these continuing sanctions are deepening our distrust.”
Li didn’t mention the second meeting plan that the U.S. president mentioned earlier this week at the UN.
Instead, he stressed three meetings between Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in over the past five months, saying: “If the other side of denuclearization is South Korea rather than North Korea, then denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula will not become so steady.”
China has announced that it will reduce import tariffs on 1,855 items for tax purposes from November 1, 2018.
Since this year, China has been actively reducing import tariffs.
On May 1, this year, the total tax on drugs will be reduced, and the import duty will be adjusted to zero for a total of 28 tax purposes, including all common medicines including anti-cancer drugs and bio-alkaline drugs with anti-cancer effects.
At the same time, the value-added tax burden on the production and import of anti-cancer drugs has also been significantly reduced.
Tax reduction on 218 cars and parts for tax purposes.
After the tax reduction, China's car tax rate has been lower than the average level of developing countries, in line with the reality of China's automotive industry.
This tax reduction will promote industry structural adjustment and resource optimization, accelerate the depreciation, help improve the quality of products and services, and is expected to promote the adjustment of car prices to a certain extent, so that consumers get more affordable.
Reduced tax on 1449 daily consumer goods for tax purposes
Reducing the tax on consumer goods on a daily basis is closely related to the people's needs for a better life.
This tax reduction was not only numerous but also strong, with an average tax reduction of 56%.
Reduce the tax on consumer goods, directly benefit the majority of consumers, and promote domestic industry to improve competitiveness.
On November 1, tax reductions will be applied on 1,855 industrial goods such as mechanical and electrical equipment, components and raw materials for tax purposes.
Appropriately reducing the import tariffs on some domestic industrial products that are urgently needed can attract more foreign investment, be conducive to increasing domestic effective supply, assisting industry upgrading, while helping enterprises to allocate resources on a global scale, reduce production costs, and also reduce domestic environmental pressure.
According to the relevant officials of the Office of the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council of China, the four autonomous tax cuts, and the third step of tax cuts implemented on July 1 this year based on the results of the information technology agreement, will reduce China's total tariff level from 9.8% to 7.5% last year.
The adjusted total tariff level is slightly higher than that of the European Union, lower than that of most developing countries, and is at a medium and low level, basically matching China's status and development stage.
As one of the important indicators of the degree of opening up in the field of Chinese goods trade, the total level of tariffs should be adapted to the stage of Chinese economic development, reflecting the characteristics of the times.
China's commodity trade, the world's largest, has already had an economic basis for further expansion and opening up, but there is still a gap in the quality and efficiency of trade development compared to the developed economies, so the overall level of tariffs should be appropriately reduced.
Tariffs are the means of protection of compliance, the level of tariffs should be adapted to the competitiveness of the industry, encourage good competition, and excessive protection is not conducive to industrial development and quality improvement.
The adjustment of the tariff rate should take into account the needs of production and consumption.
We will focus on reducing the commodity tax rate that has greater domestic demand and contributes to industrial transformation and upgrading, strive to increase the import of products with characteristic advantages that compare the demand of the people, continuously enhance the sense of access for enterprises and the public, and meet the needs of upgrading the industrial structure and consumption structure.
Tax cuts should take into account the sustainability of fiscal income and industrial development.
In the choice of specific reduction of tax goods and the scope of tax reduction, we must coordinate the two domestic and foreign markets, the two aspects of upstream and downstream, the two relations of production and consumption, and safeguard the momentum of China's economic stability and good development.
This year marks the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up, China's initiative to reduce the total level of import tariffs is a major measure taken according to China's own need to high-quality development, which is conducive to the overall use of two resources abroad, to promote the improvement of the quality of the domestic supply system, and to meet the needs of the people's consumption and upgrading.
This action and initiative shows that China will unwaveringly pursue a mutually beneficial and win-win strategy of opening up, firmly support economic globalization, resolutely uphold the principle of free trade and the multilateral trade system with the WTO as the core, continue to draw the development momentum from opening up to the world, and also make China's development better benefit the world.
Serbia declares state of highest military readiness: President of Russia will meet tomorrow to discuss Kosovo situation
According to reports from the office of the Serbian president, as Kosovo’s special forces seized the passage of the Gazivoda water reservoir lake, which is located in the north of Kosovo and is controlled by Belgrade, Serbian President Vucic ordered the country’s armed forces to enter the highest level of alert.
On September 29, Serbian Defence Minister Wulin declared that the Serbian army had entered a state of full combat readiness.
So long as the order issued by Vucic remains in effect, Serbia will continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo, and the Serbian army will respond in whatever direction the situation develops.
On September 29, Vucic said in an interview that he had informed all parties, including the United States and Europe, of the current situation and that he would travel to Moscow on October 2 to meet with Russian President Putin to seek Putin's support on the Kosovo issue.
Asked whether Serbia needed military support from Russia as it did in Syria, Vucic responded negatively: “I don’t want a major military conflict on our territory.”
Wuchic also said that the Serbian army entered a state of full warfare only to form a deterrent to prevent conflict, but it was also a clear warning that it would not tolerate any acts of violence in Kosovo.
The raising of the Serbian military's military readiness is linked to two major actions on the part of Kosovo.
According to the Serbian side, Albanians have been massively arresting generations of Serbs living in the northern part of Kosovo in recent days, and these arrested Serbs have not violated any law.
Since Marco Yuric, head of the Serbian government’s office in Kosovo and Metohia, was beaten and captured by the Serbian army on 26 March, the situation in the region has been escalating by the Arabs, carrying out inhuman arrests and deportations of Serbs.
Moreover, more than 100 people, including special forces, armed police and snipers, occupied positions near the hydro-reservoir lake at Gazivoda hydro-electric power plant, entered the ecological and sports centers near the dam in the northern region of Kosovo, and blocked all nearby roads, which had been controlled by Serbia.
The military adventure of Kosovo was carried out under the auspices of Western countries, Kosovo’s military actions were not notified in advance to the Serbian side, violated Chapter 9 Paragraph 1 of the Brussels Agreement, as well as the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 and the military-technical agreement between CECO.
Wuchic has already shouted to NATO Secretary-General Stoltenberg, criticizing the hypocrisy of Western countries on the Kosovo issue.
The roots of this conflict are still the centuries-old history of conflict between the Syrian tribes in the Kosovo region.
Kosovo belongs to Serbs and Albanians.
Serbia regarded Kosovo as the birthplace and cultural cradle of the nation, as Serbia established its strongest state here in the 12th century, and the Albanians migrated to the north only after the invasion of the Ottoman Empire and the defeat of Serbs.
The Albanians, on the other hand, insist that the primitive tribes of the Illyrians who lived in Kosovo in the 4th and 5th centuries BC were the ancestors of the Albanians, and therefore, Kosovo has been the territory of the Albanians since ancient times.
Subjective political divisions have resulted in intense conflicts between different ethnicities, religions and cultures, resulting in intense opposition between Serbs and Albanians in the Kosovo region.
In 1912, Kosovo’s Albanians first declared independence.
After the First World War, a large number of Albanians who lived on the Balkan Peninsula migrated to Turkey, the proportion of Serbs increased relatively, and the Serbs viewed the practice of "only taking back their own land" but was viewed by the Albanians as the looting of "Greater Serbianism", and the two-ethnic contradictions intensified.
Kosovo has become the “barrel of gunpowder” of the Balkans.
In 1999, an armed conflict between Albanian separatists in the Kosovo Liberation Army and the Serbian army and police caused NATO forces to bomb the Southern Alliance of Serbia and Montenegro, and the Kosovo War broke out.
On February 17, 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared independence from Serbia.
Since then, although reports have circulated that Serbia will normalize relations with Kosovo and sign a global and legally binding agreement, due to historical national resentment and geopolitical loopholes, agreements with multiple forces such as the US and Russian Federation have not been able to sign.
Just a month ago, Vucic made the first clear statement that he called for the separation of Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo, and once again for the publication of ethnic contradictions.
Electrical communications continue to be interrupted, rescue difficulties in Indonesia due to the tsunami
According to figures released by the Indonesian disaster relief agency on the morning of 30th, the strong earthquake and tsunami that occurred on the 28th in the country's central province of Sulawesi has caused the death of 420 people.
Indonesian disaster relief chief Willem Rampangilei said the figures were only preliminary for the city of Palu, in the province of Sulawesi, about 80 kilometers from the earthquake, due to the lack of large search and rescue machinery, and the city's many people-intensive buildings such as hotels, shopping malls, warehouses and other buildings damaged by the earthquake have not yet been searched.
On September 29, 2018, a bridge destroyed by an earthquake and a tsunami in Indonesia broke into pieces.
Due to severe damage to electricity and communications facilities, the district of Galla and the neighbouring region of Sichuan are still unconnected "islands", and the number of victims cannot be estimated.
The media that Indonesian Vice President Kara said the death toll could reach thousands.
Power disruption, communication disruption, road blockade, airport damage ... rescue efforts after the earthquake and tsunami were difficult.
Due to power outages, some hospitals and rescue settlements in Palu need fuel power.
The road into the city was blocked by a mountain slope, and large transport vehicles, including tankers, were unable to enter, making the fuel supply very tense.
Indonesian Minister of Social Affairs Agus said that due to road damage, the ministry's emergency relief supplies such as tents, mattresses, carpets, clothes, food, household bags and other emergency relief supplies from the neighbouring South Sulawesi province and Colombo province have not yet arrived in the disaster area.
Disaster relief materials transported from the capital Jakarta are being transported to the disaster areas by aircraft.
Given the damage to the airport's command tower and runway in the earthquake, all commercial flights have been suspended to ensure safety and rescue, and only military aircraft carrying rescue supplies and personnel have landed.
The Indonesian Minister for Political, Legal and Security Affairs, Veranto, who commanded rescue in the earthquake area, called for the resumption of electricity supply and commercial airport services as soon as possible to ensure that rescue agencies such as hospitals operate, so that more rescue personnel and volunteers and aid materials can be delivered to the disaster area.
On the 28th, Indonesia's central Sulawesi province, Bangalore county suffered several strong earthquakes in a row, in which the 7.7 magnitude earthquake that occurred at 17:02 local time caused a tsunami, causing major disasters in the city of Palu, Bangalore county, and the region of Sichuan.

In recent days, Beijing continued to open the most beautiful blue sky model, attracted people of Yin Yin on social platforms, in the continuous brushing of the screen, the feeling of happiness, said "blue sky under white clouds, 'drunken' beautiful horizon, this is Beijing's best business card ".
Since August, Beijing has witnessed the “blue sky”.

At 8 a.m., the vast majority of 35 air quality monitoring sites across the city showed "grade one" green.
The "Blue Sky" photo contest, spontaneously organized by the public on social platforms, is still ongoing.
Why is the sky in Beijing so blue?
According to the relevant person in charge of the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, in August this year, Beijing's fine particulate matter (PM2.5) average concentration was 35 micrograms / cubic meter, making the best record in the history of the same period in the past five years.
The real-time concentration of PM2.5 in September is more frequent.
A major factor in the emergence of the "blue sky" lies in the recent period of general favorable weather conditions, and more importantly, Beijing has continued to carry out air pollution management, and has vigorously promoted the clean air action plan in the past five years, continued release of environmental benefits, so that the total pollutant emissions in the region are reduced, which have laid the foundation for continuous improvement of air quality.
Beijing officially launched and implemented the Beijing City Clean Air Action Plan 2013-2017.
According to the plan, the official continued to guide non-capital functional evasion, promote energy cleaning alternative and pollution reduction work, and eliminated a total of 4,923 coal-fired boilers.
Beijing has also become the first major city in mainland China to realize the full network of natural gas.
The data show that between 2013 and 2017, Beijing's average annual concentration of PM2.5 has decreased by 35.6%, the number of days in which air quality reached the target has increased by 50 days, the number of days in the first level has increased by 25 days, and the number of days in which heavy pollution has decreased by 35 days, and the incidence of heavy pollution has decreased significantly.
At the same time, the continuous improvement of air quality, Beijing official based on a new round of PM2.5 sources analysis, in September this year released the "Beijing City Win Blue Sky Defense War Three-Year Action Plan", aimed at the current stage of governance and pollution characteristics, focus on diesel trucks, dust, volatile organic materials governance and other key prevention areas, optimize the adjustment of transportation structure, industrial structure, energy structure and land structure, strengthen regional Union defense joint control, focus on strengthening urban refinement management, comprehensively promote green development, strive to make the "Blue Sky" permanently in Beijing City, no longer "things are rare", let it return to the people's album background rather than the main character.
During this year's National Day Golden Week, the Municipal Tourism Commission, industry, commerce, urban administration, public security and other relevant departments will strengthen law enforcement inspections on the "one-day tour" market, focus on tourism "six black" messes, and once illegal offenders are verified, they will be punished in accordance with the law.
Yesterday morning, the municipal government held a special meeting to strictly combat the illegal "One Day Tour" and deployed special actions to further strictly combat the illegal "One Day Tour".
The meeting revealed that focusing on the "six black" disorder that intertwined the blacklist, black guide, black company, black car, black store, black network interest chain, the city has launched a special operation to strictly combat the illegal "one day tour" since July 28.
To date, the city has accepted 39 complaints of "One Day Tour", a decline of 63%, and since this year, the city has accepted 270 complaints of "One Day Tour", a decline of 62%.
In the past two months, the city seized 248 "black cars", investigated 158 violations of tourism passenger transportation business, closed 29 shopping "black shops" and performing venues, seized 13 "black companies" and "black guides" 27 people, confiscated 2.6 thousand illegal advertisements, dismantled 31 unlawful "day trip" advertisements, public transportation counterfeit signs 3 pieces, investigated 1789 of various travel-related violations, 181 cases, from various functional departments, from a heavy fine of 4.48 million yuan, and detained 111 people involved in travel violations.
After rectification, the illegal "one-day trip" mess basically was curbed, and the "one-day trip" market order showed a stable and positive trend.
In recent years, the city has steadily increased its efforts to remedy the illegal "one-day tour".
In 2016 and 2017, the City Tourism Commission accepted 1612 and 897 complaints of "One Day Tour", respectively reducing 79% and 44%, but the illegal "One Day Tour" still repeatedly and often rebounded, and formed the "six-black" chain of interests such as black ticketing, black guides, black companies, black cars, black shops, black networks.
Specifically, illegal travelers in the streets are "black tickets", illegal websites that publish fake tourist information are "black networks", travel agencies that engage in illegal "one day trip" or travel agencies that do not operate qualified institutions or individuals are "black companies", "black companies" employed without a tourist license or illegal practice of guides are "black guides", their use of non-tourist passenger qualified vehicles or tourist qualified vehicles that provide travel services for illegal "one day trip" are "black cars", and ultimately they bring tourists to the designated tourist shopping "black store".
In this special operation, the city continued to increase the fixed type inspection and mobile inspection of the illegal "One Day Tour", targeting the high frequency of the illegal "One Day Tour" and affecting the major tourist lines, and the relevant departments daily sent a group of dark visits to the car with a group of dark visits, and found evidence of illegal violation of the law.
Among them, the “black car” and the “black shop” became two strict focus in the special action.
Without a black car, the illegal "One Day Tour" cannot be completed, and the black car is easy to detect, remember and investigate, as well as fixed assets of high individual value.
Relevant departments use road traffic monitoring probes to increase the supervision of the main "day trip" tourist bus line, and use technical prevention, material protection and other scientific and technological intelligent means to detect the "black car" in a timely manner.
The tourist shopping "black shop" has also become a strict focus due to the small number and seating.
In order to strengthen the deterrence and combat efforts against the illegal "One Day Tour", whenever illegal violations are found in special actions, the functions of the departments shall be punished in accordance with the law.
In August this year, the city also held a seminar on strictly combating illegal "One Day Tour" related legal issues, and discussed measures to combine administrative punishment with imprisonment.
The City Tourism Commission said that in the future, more formal travel agencies will be encouraged to carry out Beijing's "one-day trip", increase the supply of formal "one-day trip", in order to further crush the survival space of illegal "one-day trip", the specific plans are still being studied.
In addition, the Municipal Tourism Commission has also continuously improved the tourism group's electronic schedule information system, ensuring that each team is included in the electronic schedule platform supervision.
From a tourist symbol to a digital economy symbol, what has the city experienced over the years?
As the permanent venue of the World Internet Conference, the city is concerned about how to take on the summit dividends.
In the first five years since the first World Internet Conference, the changes in the city of Utah have been noticeable.
In 2014, there were only 12 enterprises related to the digital economy and the Internet in the city, and by the third quarter of this year, there were more than 500.
This is a shortcut of the development of the digital economy in the city.
The convening of the Internet conference allows local enterprises to accept the inspiration of the digital economy and the digital wave, the desire for transformation and upgrading of enterprises is very strong, and traditional manufacturing enterprises have increased their investment and research and development in the field of machine replacement and intelligent management.
Zhang Qing, secretary of the Party Committee of Utah Town, said that the city will build a new economic empowerment center in the future.
The development of the digital economy cannot be supported by infrastructure.
This year, the city launched 5G pilot work on the basis of the realization of 4G communication networks and free WiFi full coverage.
At the same time, the town of Kyiv, which is located in the town, as the first county-level city in the country to build an international Internet data channel, has also become the hotspot for the development of the Internet industry.
Since the first World Internet Conference, Kyiv has introduced a total of 565 digital economy projects, with a total investment of 377.25 billion yuan planned, and the total output of the digital economy core manufacturing industry achieved 87.3 billion yuan in the first three quarters of this year, with an increase in value of 13%.
“Before the town was a tourist symbol, and later more a drama and cultural symbol. Since the Internet Congress, it has now become a symbol of the Internet and the digital economy.”
Xi Jinping, secretary of the Kyiv City Committee, believes that the dividend of the World Internet Conference has accumulated over time, therefore, it is also more necessary to build a platform to undertake the overlapping import of talents, projects, technologies and other elements from all sides.
Shenyuan, who has been working abroad for 20 years, returned home to start business because of the connection with the Internet conference.
On December 2, last year, he entered the fourth Internet Light Expo with a high-capacity anti-corruption digital technology solution, which was favored by several customers.
Sheny chooses to start a business in the city of Utah not only because of the home country, "In the city of Utah, recruiting people is easier than I thought, our application is also landed quickly, and the city of Utah smart parking project has our application."
A town hall, which presents the influence of the Internet conference.
This highway that runs north and south of Kyiv is not only a tourist attraction, but also an industrial avenue.
As a result of this, the city of Utah was created.
The reporter learned that in the future, the Utah Avenue will become the main position for the development of Kyiv industry, leading the large number of applications of smart healthcare, smart retirement, smart government and other achievements, gathering up 80 percent of the city's GDP industry and many high-level talents.
Tsunami in Indonesia has killed at least 410 people
According to the director of the Jakarta Police Public Information Bureau, the current earthquake in central Sulawesi province has killed 410 people, 97 of whom have been identified.
Another 29 people were missing and 540 were injured.
Palo Airport is currently closed.
With active treatment, China's 29 weeks and above premature child survival rate reached 98%, has reached the level of developed countries.
On September 30, the National Children's Medical Center and the affiliated pediatric hospital of the University of Fudan disclosed that it introduced Canada's advanced methods in the leading "China NICU Hospital Pregnancy Pregnancy Quality Improvement Project".
The results of the project showed that with active treatment, China's 29 weeks and above premature child survival rate reached 98%, has reached the level of developed countries, but there is still considerable room for improvement in premature child and premature child survival rate without complications.
For 20 years, the Chinese government has focused on the rescue of newborns.
At present, the infant mortality rate in the Shanghai region has dropped to 3.71 ‰, significantly below the national average, reaching the advanced level of developed countries.
The "China NICU Hospitalized Preterm Child Pregnancy Quality Improvement Project" through 4 years of unremitting efforts has greatly improved the quality of survival of preterm babies.
Prof. Cao Yun, director of the Newborn Serious Surveillance Room (NICU) of the University's affiliated pediatric hospital, said to reporters that while raising the survival rate of preterm babies, focusing on reducing the quality of survival of preterm babies, reducing the incidence of complications, improving the neurodevelopmental prognosis, improving the overall outcome of patients, and improving the overall quality of survival of preterm babies and the quality of the population is of important importance, which is an important issue of concern for the domestic and foreign pediatric community, and the neonatal pediatric community, as well as the key issue of concern for this project.
The "China NICU Hospitalized Preterm Child Pregnancy Quality Improvement Program" through 4 years of unremitting efforts, recording tens of thousands of cases of preterm babies aged 33 weeks and below in the country, so that the mortality rate of preterm babies in small fetal age and small birthweight decreased by 1/3, while the incidence of serious complications in preterm babies decreased significantly, significantly improving the quality of survival of preterm babies.
Through the establishment of a national collaborative network for improving the quality of newborns and the introduction of the concept of collaborative quality improvement, the project will radiate 25 collaborative hospitals across China, and establish a set of collaborative methods for improving the prognosis of premature infants and improving the level of treatment of newborns.
The University's affiliated pediatric hospital is joining national neonatal pediatric forces to develop guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections based on the accumulated experience of the project, and provide reference and guidance for the standard diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections in China.
It is understood that in the "China Early Child Pregnancy Quality Improvement Project", pediatric hospitals have introduced the EPIQ method to 25 large NICUs in 19 provinces in the country, dedicated to solving the problem of premature child infection that plagues the Chinese newborn care room.
After more than 10 years of continuous improvement, Canada's national premature birth survival rate increased by about 1/3, Canada is currently ranked among the world's best countries for premature birth prognosis.
The EPIQ methodology has now been applied to all NICUs across Canada and has been adopted by six countries.
Pediatric hospitals revealed that the findings showed that after two years of EPIQ intervention, preterm infection decreased by 35%, while antibiotic use decreased by 20%.
In the future, the Pediatric Hospital will continue to promote and implement this method throughout the country, focusing on comprehensively reducing the incidence of all complications in preterm babies and improving the quality of treatment for newborns across the country.
At present, there are differences and inequalities in the level of rescue in various regions in China.
As an important construction unit of the national children's medical center, pediatric hospitals will play the leading role of radiation, this study covers Xinjiang, Guizhou, Gansu, Shaanxi and other western provinces, in order to gradually promote the homogenization and standardization of newborn treatment across the country.
It is understood that the subsidiary pediatric hospital of the University of Qian'an is joining national neonatal pediatric forces, based on the accumulated experience of the project, to formulate guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections, to provide reference and guidance for the standard clinical treatment of infection of newborns in China.
In 2019, the coordination center, located in the subordinate pediatric hospital of the University of Fudan, will join 63 hospitals across the country to carry out the next phase of national quality improvement in order to promote the uniform development of the level of newborn treatment in China.
Shanghai City Health and Life Planning Commission Director Zhao Zhao Wei said that Shanghai can become the center of Asia, not only in research, but also the construction of the entire service system, service quality and service results should have a place in Asia, so that it truly reflects China's medical level.
Cincinnati: Build a “hero monument” in your heart – written on the fifth martyr’s anniversary.
On September 30, on the eve of the 69th anniversary of the Republic, we celebrated the fifth martyr's anniversary, and Party and national leaders such as Xi Jinping came to Tiananmen Square to attend a ceremony to pay tribute to the heroes of the people.
Now, wherever you are, please pay tribute.
The Day of Remembrance is warmer and more awake.
The heavy history, behind the name of each martyr, is a lively life.
They, too, have a fierce youth, have sincere love, have concerned families.
However, because they firmly believe that “our belief is the truth of the universe,” they are willing to sacrifice everything in order to “save the suffering of the next generation.”
“I will cry for China for a day to survive.”
Travelling through time and space, the heroes set up a spiritual roadmark that guides the direction of moving forward.
“Where do you come from, where do you go,” “what kind of person to be,” read and understand, it is not difficult to find answers.
To commemorate the hero, the most important thing is to build a "hero monument" in the heart.
According to incomplete statistics, since the years of the Revolutionary War, about 20 million martyrs have devoted themselves heroically to national independence, the liberation of the people and the prosperity of the country.
For various reasons, many of them have not even left a name.
Countless mermaids poured blood into ideals, practiced faith with their lives, remembered their names, and passed on their spirit, which is the guardian of the roots and souls of the nation.
This "Hero Monument" does not allow any dirt and destruction.
For a while, dark currents such as historical nihilism and pan-entertainment have flooded.
All kinds of practices that distort history, depreciate heroism, challenge the conscience of justice, distort value judgments, and cause public anger and alertness in the whole society.
The hero cannot be forgotten, the hero cannot be forgotten.
The act of touching the bottom line cannot be listened to, we must dare to light the sword and defend the dignity with the rule of law and justice.
On May 1, the Law on the Protection of Heroes and Martyrs came into effect.
From the point of view of judicial practice, the judgment of some cases is very popular, and both effectively safeguard the brilliant and glorious image in accordance with the law, but also release the positive energy of worshiping heroes and admiring Prior.
A nation with pursuits cannot be without heroes, and a country with ideals cannot be without pioneers.
Remembering the first and calling for heroes has become a general social consensus.
Currently, there are millions of memorial facilities all over the country, and more than 100 million people visit the martyrs' mountains every year.
The heart is the strongest foundation.
Let the worship of heroes, the defense of heroes, the learning of heroes, the caring for heroes, and the integration of the spirit of heroism into the national bloodstream, a "hero monument" will stand in the heavens and the depths of the people.
Brussels, 28 September (Reuters) - The European Union has taken a non-confrontation stance on Italy on Friday after it disregarded the EU's demands to make the market unexpected with its large-scale budget deficit scheme, but the EU may take a more radical stance if Italy adheres to its too bold goals.
The European government’s target for the next three years is a budget deficit equivalent to 2.4 percent of GDP, indicating that there is still no debt cuts in the face of deficit cuts alone.
EU Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Mr Moscovici, said on Friday that “we are not interested in the crisis between the Commission and Italy,” and that he responded cautiously as the EU’s proposals and sanctions could have little impact on Italy.
EU officials and diplomats still hope that market forces will be able to convince Italy to adjust its budget plan before Italy formally submits it to the European Commission in October.
After the government announced its plans, the euro fell on Friday to the lowest level in two weeks, while Italian bond yields hit the highest level in three weeks.
If the deficit target remains unchanged before the October deadline, the European Commission could veto Italy’s draft budget, something it has never done to any country.
European Commission Vice-President Dombrovsky later said at a meeting in Riga on Friday that Italy’s current fiscal plan “seems to be inconsistent with the Stability and Growth Pact,” referring to the EU’s fiscal rules.
But he did not say what would trigger the EU’s reaction.
Bidders can submit applications for participation in this public tender by October 26.

National non-film cotton field observation and research exchange activities experts entered the trial field, listen to the presentation of the team representatives of Chinese engineering institutes.
Xinjiang Shia on September 30 (Geng Dandan Wang Little Army) located in Xinjiang Shia County's non-film cotton cultivation experimental base, non-film cotton is very pleased, compared with the next side of the landscape cotton is "not bad", the snow-white cotton competition is "open", hanging branches.
From September 27 to 28, the national non-film cotton field observation and study exchange activities were held in Xinjiang Shaya Prefecture.
The reporter at the observation conference learned that the non-film cotton technology system, which is mainly based on "Chinese cotton 619" and its supporting cultivation measures, has initially achieved the goal of cotton fields without film cultivation, reduced the pollution of Xinjiang cotton field residual film on the ecological environment and raw cotton, and made significant progress in the comprehensive technical research and demonstration of non-film cotton.
Chinese Academy of Engineering academician, renowned cotton genetic breeder, the national modern agricultural industry technology system cotton system chief scientist Zhou Sheng academician to Zhejiang Agricultural and Forestry University party committee secretary Zhou National model to introduce the non-film cotton growth situation.
"We have developed a comprehensive technology that can fully realize the cultivation of cotton without ground membrane, can thoroughly solve the problem of residual membrane pollution and green cotton cultivation."
The Chinese Academy of Engineering has a quick introduction.
Xinjiang is China's most important cotton production area, according to the statistics of the National Bureau of Statistics, in 2017 Xinjiang cotton cultivation area was 35 million acres, accounting for 61% of the national cotton area.
Since the introduction of the landscape in China in 1982, the landscape coverage area of various crops in Xinjiang has reached more than 50 million acres, and the annual use of landscape is about 300,000 tons.
Among them, the cotton landscape coverage rate reaches 100%, and cotton field coverage accounts for about 60% of Xinjiang landscape use.
Non-film cotton for measuring production, cotton production can fully acre production of 320 kg to 350 kg.
With the continuous increase of Xinjiang ground film input, the recovery rate of residual ground film is low, the amount of residual film in the soil is gradually increasing, and the residual film causes a series of problems such as soil structure destruction, which seriously affects the sustainable development of agriculture.
The residual film not only causes serious pollution to the soil, but also greatly affects the quality of cotton fibers.
At present, more than one-third of Xinjiang's cotton fields have been mechanized for harvesting.
In 2017, Xinjiang machine cotton harvest area was about 14 million acres.
In the process of machine cotton harvesting, a large amount of land surface and cotton strains on the sliced film, the sliced film mixed in the raw cotton in the process of raw cotton processing is difficult to clear, in the subsequent process of textile processing can not be thoroughly cleared, seriously affecting the quality of textile products.
On September 28, the national non-film cotton field observation and study exchange activities were held in Xinjiang Shaya County.
In order to focus on solving the pollution of cotton fields, simplify cotton planting technology, and improve cotton field efficiency, Mr. Tree rapidly led his team through 8 years of time, implementing the "Cotton 619" filmless cotton technology cultivation, and "add wings" for the green development of Xinjiang agriculture.
Through innovative cultivation of new ideas, cultivate the special early ripeness, salt-resistant, low-temperature and abundant land cotton new product line "CNC619".
“The ‘China Cotton 619’ under the conditions of filmless cultivation in the southern region of Xinjiang has achieved a series of supporting measures such as the mechanical support of filmless seeding, the improvement of seeding depth, the shallow burial of the drop tube under the conditions of the filmless, the appropriate seeding density screening, and reasonable chemical regulation.”
Currently, Axou, Kourler, Aral and other places have established non-film cotton demonstration bases, with a production of 4800 kilograms per hectare.
Non-film cotton cultivation has achieved abundant output, efficiency, environmental protection, and improved comprehensive efficiency.
Zhang Hai, an agricultural artist at the 3rd division of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, said that through 6 years of non-film cotton cultivation technology research and demonstration, the production of non-film cotton seeds can be fully achieved from 320 kg to 350 kg, or even higher.
"The promotion of non-film cotton cultivation technology is very promising."
Zhang Genghai believes that at present, filmless cotton cultivation technology can thoroughly solve the problem of soil residual membrane pollution, but there is still a certain gap in economic benefits compared to landscape cultivation.
“The support of cotton acquisition prices will be beneficial for future expansion.”
In the next step, he and his team will continue to conduct in-depth research and large-scale application of non-film cotton, strengthen the non-film cotton industry, and thoroughly solve the problem of soil pollution caused by the ground film.

Hong Kong is China's Hong Kong, and Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs.
The Conservative Party's Human Rights Committee has used the Party's annual meeting to focus on anti-China separatist forces, and China has expressed its serious concern and strong dissatisfaction.
We strongly oppose any organization to interfere in Hong Kong affairs in any way.
Any attempt and action to advocate “Hong Kong’s independence” is futile.
The spokesman said that Britain has consistently listed freedom of speech, but that it is completely unacceptable when Chinese journalists are asked to express their opinions at the border meeting, but that they are hindered and even personally assaulted.
We demand that the Conservative Committee on Human Rights stop interfering in China's internal affairs, stop interfering in Hong Kong's affairs, and that the conference organizers apologize to Chinese journalists.

Wang Yi reiterated that China will surely take a path of development different from that of traditional great powers.
This path with Chinese characteristics has determined that China will not and will not be able to repeat the superstition of the country, and has also determined that China will not become the United States, will not challenge the United States, and will not replace the United States.
In his speech entitled "Opportunities or Challenges, Partners or Adversaries," Wang Yi said the profound synthesis of the current problems is that some American friends believe that China will also dominate the country, and will even challenge and replace America's leadership in the world.
“This is clearly a major strategic misjudgment.”

We believe that countries can coexist in harmony and exchange knowledge.
No matter what happened in the past, now or in the future, China will neither follow foreign patterns nor demand that other countries replicate China’s practices.
Earlier, when Wang Yi met with former U.S. Secretary of State Kissinger in New York, he said that China-U.S. cooperation will win-win, and confrontation will inevitably lose.
China is always committed to developing long-term and healthy and stable China-US relations, realizing no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation.

Under the subsidiary arrangement, pickups produced in both countries will be fully exempt from tariffs.
If Trump imposes car tariffs, Mexico will receive an annual tax exemption quota of $1.08 billion for auto parts, while Canada will receive a quota of $32.4 billion.
Both of these quotas are far higher than the existing production levels of the two countries, providing room for growth for both countries' exports.
REUTERS WASHINGTON/Mexico (Reuters) - Mexico said on Friday that, after days of debate, the administration of President Trump and Canada are making concrete efforts to resolve trade policy differences, leaving the outside world expecting the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to remain in the form of a tripartite agreement.
Despite the lack of details, the above obvious progress was enough to prompt the Mexican and U.S. governments to suddenly halt their plans to publish the text of the bilateral trade agreement, giving Canada more time to join the agreement.
Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told reporters in Mexico that the U.S. government had made new counter-recommendations to the Canadian government and that he would continue to push all three countries to join NAFTA.
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said the time to submit the text of the U.S.-Mexico trade agreement to Mexican and U.S. legislation was postponed as the Canadian and U.S. governments “very seriously” attempted to reach an agreement.
In the next 48 hours, we will know whether we have reached a tripartite agreement text or have to publish the two-party agreement text.
Guaidó said his U.S. and Canadian counterparts had "specially requested" to postpone the publication of the text.
A spokesman for the U.S. Trade Representative Office (USTR) did not comment on the text of the U.S.-Mexico trade agreement and the U.S.-Canada consultations.
Officials from the Canadian Prime Minister’s Office and the Foreign Minister’s Office did not respond to requests for comments on the counter-recommendation.
According to foreign media reports, in a preservation center in the suburbs of Pretoria, the capital of South Africa, two little lions play together, it is hard to see anything unusual, but they are not alone.
The University of Pretoria announced: “This is the first ever lion born by artificial insemination – the first pair in the world.”
Scientists at the campus are working on the reproductive system of the mother African lion.
Genswinth, director of the University of Pretoria’s Institute for Mammal Studies, said the two lions who were born on August 25 were fairly healthy and normal.
His team, after 18 months of intensive testing, finally reached this breakthrough.
Gunswick said at a press visit: “We picked up sperm from a healthy lion.”
Then, when the hormone content in the lion's body reached the appropriate level, the researchers artificially fertilized it.
Genswint said: “Fortunately, the outcome succeeded.”
He said the researchers “did several attempts, but unexpectedly didn’t take too much effort.”
He said the breakthrough in the previous study can be re-verified, and scientists hope to use this technology to save large cat animals in danger of extinction.
The International Union for Conservation of Nature notes that lions have been extinct in 26 African countries, with the total number of surviving wild lions declining by 43% over the past 20 years to about 20,000.
African lions are classified as vulnerable animals.
Gunsworth said: “If we don’t do something for these animals, they’ll face extinction.”
He said the new technology does not require lions to be raised, but only to inject sperm into fertile lion bodies, as is the practice of captivating elephants in North America and Europe.
South Korea's export decline in September was the largest in more than two years, but analysts blamed the decline on fewer working days and said global demand for South Korean goods remained strong despite rising trade tensions.
Indeed, South Korea’s exports increased daily last month.
In addition, preliminary data released earlier showed a two-digit growth in exports in the first weeks of September ahead of the long holiday.
South Korea's exports declined in September, the largest since July 2016, greater than the 5.7 percent drop in revenue forecast by 11 analysts surveyed by Reuters.
The initial value released on Monday showed exports in September at $506.6 billion, down from $512.1 billion in August.
While concerns that the escalating U.S.-China trade dispute could cause other Chinese neighbors to rely on exports to suffer, South Korea’s exports to China grew by 7.8 percent in September, expanding for the 23rd consecutive month.
South Korea’s exports to the U.S. fell 11.8 percent, due to declining sales of oil products.
South Korea’s sales of memory chips and petroleum products overseas grew by 28.3% and 13.5% respectively, despite market concerns that the so-called chip “supercycle” may have reached its peak.
“H, the impact of a trade conflict will be difficult to avoid, as South Korea’s exports are substantially dependent on the U.S. and Chinese markets.”
Imports fell 2.1% to $40.8 billion, less than Reuters survey forecasts for growth of 3.1%.
The initial trade surplus in September was $7.7 billion, up from $6.9 billion in August.
The Ministry of Industry said that thanks to the gifts of the United States and the EU countries, the global manufacturing industry will remain flourishing, which is a favorable factor for Korean exports.
“The increase in export prices caused by rising oil prices will also benefit exports in the second half of this year.”
“But the continued trade conflict between the United States and China, coupled with rising market volatility following the U.S. interest rate hike, are all negative pressures facing exports.”
On average, exports per working day rose to $2.6 billion in September and $2.1 billion in August.
This year’s Mid-Autumn Festival falls on September 24-26, so there are only 19.5 working days in September, four days less than in the same period last year.
South Korea's exports increased by 4.7% in September from the same period last year.
According to the Daily News/Markit Procurement Managers Index, South Korean manufacturing activity rose in September, but was backed by domestic orders as orders from China and Japan declined, which is likely to overshadow other export prospects.
North Korean media criticizes U.S. not easing sanctions
North Korea's Labour News published a signature commentary on September 30 criticizing the U.S. in seeking dialogue with the DPRK but not easing sanctions on the DPRK, calling it a "contradictory" practice.
The article said that U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo said on the 14th that "in order to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, the key is to fulfill the sanctions against the DPRK", stressing the U.S. position to continue to fulfill the UN sanctions resolutions unchanged.
In the joint statement, the two sides pledged to establish a new North American relationship in line with the desire of the people of the two countries to hope for peaceful prosperity.
The United States, on the one hand, increased sanctions and pressure, on the other hand, demanded dialogue, such a practice is undoubtedly contradictory.
If we want to establish new DPRK-US relations, build a permanently consolidated peace system on the Korean Peninsula, and complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, we should put trust building first, starting with what can be done, and solving it step by step.
The article also said that the United States should understand that sanctions against North Korea will not work.
The article said that even the "Northern Devinsk" before the "Kashan" was admired by the U.S. military.
The National Interest magazine quoted the U.S. Navy as saying: “We will encounter a powerful potential opponent.
The current commander-in-chief of the U.S. Navy in Europe, Fugo, also praised the submarine "Northern Devinsk".
“Look at the development of the Russian Navy and how it uses its resources, and you will know that its main effort in research and development is first and foremost to strengthen its submarine fleet.”
But National Interest magazine still believes that the United Statesins an advantage over Russia in this area.
Fugo said: “I believe that Western countries still have an asymmetric advantage.”
Earlier it was that the Russian Navy will deploy the submarine "Kashan" in 2019.
“Kasan”, “New Siberia”, “Krasnoyarsk” and “Arkhangelsk” multi-purpose submarines are all improved “White Wax-M” type, drainage capacity of 13,800 tons, diving depth of 520 meters, personnel prepared for 64 people, underwater speed of 31 nodes, will carry mines, fishing torpedoes and “caliber” and “Calmar” cruise missiles.

EU to reach oil purchase agreement with Iran
The U.S. government recently announced that it would resume a new round of sanctions against Iran in November, and even urged other countries to reduce imports of Iranian oil.
However, American allies did not seem to listen.
According to the U.S. New York Times, Iran's Foreign Minister Zarif revealed in an interview on Monday that despite U.S. threats to sanction any country that does business with Iran, Tehran is approaching an agreement with the EU on the sale of crude oil.
The core purpose of the agreement is to try to establish a new payment mechanism to replace dollar transactions with easy-to-go or real-currency pricing.
The approach is aimed at hoping to bypass the United States and prevent the United States from hindering financial transfers.
Meanwhile, while the EU is working to facilitate the deal, some French and British officials are also concerned that if the deal is reached, it will be the most open confrontation between the EU and the United States opposed to the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.
During an hour’s interview, Zarif’s words sounded more optimistic than in recent months.
Because the deal has the ability to “separate” America’s traditional allies and effectively break the US’s attempts to cut Iran’s revenue.
"This ensures that we sell oil and benefit," Zarif said, adding that countries have the legitimate right to trade with Iran under the 2015 agreement.
Federica Mogherini, the EU’s chief foreign policy officer, said: “No sovereign country or organization can accept others to decide who they can trade with.”
However, she also predicted that before the U.S. government introduced the next step of sanctions in November, U.S. leaders could take a series of financial measures aimed at banks, businessmen and nations that do business with Tehran.
In May, the U.S. government unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear deal on the basis of a faulty agreement, saying the agreement could not permanently ban Iran’s production of nuclear fuel.
The U.S. then threatened to ban companies that buy Iranian oil and other goods from doing business in the U.S.
The threat prompted some companies to evacuate from Tehran and the Iranian currency fell.
Companies such as Airbus and French oil giant Total have canceled billions of dollars in investments in Iran.
British and French officials have said the U.S. government may be “overriding.”
However, according to a recent Turkish media report, the US sanctions do not seem to have a significant impact on Iran's oil exports.
Iranian Petroleum Minister Zhangane revealed yesterday that no other country except South Korea stopped buying Iranian oil.
Zarif and Iranian President Rouhani both argue that a series of U.S. actions are intended to “tempt” Iran to violate the agreement.
Zarif was also dismayed by a series of verbal attacks by the United States, and when asked whether the United States would overthrow the current Iranian government with increasing fiscal pressure, Zarif even laughed, “It’s a regime change strategy, and that’s the real purpose of the United States.”

Reporters learned from the National Health and Health Commission that compared with decades ago, the incidence of malnutrition in children and adolescents in China has decreased, but the incidence of overweight obesity has increased significantly.
Experts pointed out thatining a healthy weight, the most important philosophy is "to cure without disease", and greatly promote scientific fitness and reasonable diet.
According to the National Health and Health Commission recently released "China Youth Health Education Core Information and Explanation" (2018 edition), the key toining a healthy weight is a reasonable diet and scientific exercise.
Overweight, obesity and blind weight loss are not good for health.
The health hazards behind the “small fat” cannot be ignored.
China's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Nutrition and Health Director Ding Jiang said that overweight obesity jeopardizes normal growth and development of adolescents, has a negative impact on their psychology, behavior, cognition and intelligence, and can even lead to high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high blood lipids in children.
At the same time, adolescent overweight obesity is likely to continue to adulthood, which will increase the risk of chronic diseases such as high blood pressure and diabetes in adolescents after adulthood.
Ding Xiang said that in 2010-2012, China's population nutrition and health status testing showed that the overweight rate of 6-17-year-old teenagers in China was 9.6%, obesity rate was 6.4% and 16% respectively.
At the same time, overweight adolescents present characteristics of boys higher than girls, cities higher than the countryside, and overweight obesity rates have increased significantly in recent decades.
How do teenagers deal with overweight?
Zhang Ping, deputy director of the National Sports General Administration's Science and Fitness and Health Promotion Research Center, pointed out that the main reason for adolescent obesity is over-calorie intake and insufficient physical activity.
For this simplicity of obesity, the focus should be on scientific exercise coupled with reasonable dietary control.
Zhang Ping pointed out thatining a healthy weight, the most important philosophy is "healing without illness", a very important part of which is a comprehensive cop education for schools, parents and students, popularizing the harm of overweight and obesity, and raising the awareness of prevention among adolescents.
Adolescents should regularly undergo medical examinations, monitor growth and development indicators such as high body weight, early detection and scientific judgment of whether there is an overweight and obese problem, in order to intervene in a timely manner.
For adolescents who are already overweight, Deng Xiaoping recommends that, in addition to the proactive scientific arrangement of meals and exercise, adolescents are in a special physiological stage, should avoid the use of hunger or semi-hunger therapy to control and reduce weight, and should not blindly take weight loss drugs.
Reuters (Reuters) - Facebook (FB.O) said on Friday that hackers stole digital landing codes and gained access to 50 million user accounts, involving unprecedented security breaches, the worst in its history.
Facebook has more than 2.2 billion monthly users, saying it’s not yet clear whether the attackers abused any accounts or stole personal information.
The company has not found the location of the hacker, nor is it sure whether the hacker was targeting a specific victim.
Preliminary analysis suggests it was a large-scale attack.
At a press conference, Zuckerberg called the incident “truly serious.”
A spokesman for the company said his account and the account of Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg were also affected.
Facebook stock fell 2.6 percent on Friday, dragging the main Wall Street stock index.
U.S. lawmakers said on Friday that the attack could increase the outlook for data privacy legislation.
“This is another sad evidence that Congress needs to take action to protect the privacy and security of social media users,” Democratic Senator Mark Warner said in a statement.
Rohit Chopra, a member of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), said on Twitter that he hopes to get an answer to Reuters’ reports of the security breach.

The newly revised "Three Canyon-Grecia Dam Waterway Hub Scheduling Rules" (hereinafter referred to as the "Scheduling Rules") was officially implemented from October 1, and the Three Canyon Shipyard was officially unified with the shipyard two years after the trial.
On the first day of implementation of the new rules, the navigation in the waters of the Three Canyon-Grace Dam is in good order.
The Jiangsu Three Canyon Navigation Administration released the first security inspection plan on September 30 at 21 am and conducted a security inspection of 160 vessels, with a total of 124 vessels qualified for safety inspection.
At 14 a.m. on October 1, the traffic department arranged the first gateway plan after the implementation of the new rules.
After the implementation of the new rules, the safety inspection plan will be released once daily at 9 and 21 a.m., and the dam plan will be released once daily at 14 and 20 a.m., facilitating the flexibility of the ship to arrange the dam plan.
The Scheduling Procedure adds the "classification control" of the ship's dam scheduling principle, according to the positioning of the gate and the lifting machine function, clear the priority order of the dam vessels separately, and the short-line passenger vessels of the gate are adjusted to the same priority level as the demonstration vessels and integrity vessels.
This is also the two-year anniversary of the test operation of the boarding aircraft, which was officially unified with the port.
For the first time, the large-length demonstration vessels and new energy-powered vessels in the川江 and three-canyon districts are also ranked as priorities.
At the same time, the Scheduling Procedure will adjust the "shipment scheduling management waters" from the previous 180 km near-dams water area to the 541.8 km water area of the Yunnan Long River Bridge to the Stone Chief Long River Bridge, and divide the "core waters, near-dams waters, control waters, scheduling waters".
This move is conducive to the ship's choice of suitable water ports and reduces the accumulation pressure of vessels in the dam ports.
In accordance with the characteristics of existing vessels, the Regulation also proposed integrity restrictions such as the cancellation of the declaration of vessels for violations and the delay of the 24 hours of the dam.
After the storage of water in the Three Canyon, the navigation conditions in the reservoir area have been improved, promoting the rapid development of Yangtze River shipping.
The data showed that the annual cargo passing volume of the Three Strait Gate and the Gulf Dam Gate increased from 34.3 million tons in 2004 to 1.3 billion tons and 1.4 million tons respectively in 2017.
In the past two years, the trial passenger aircraft passed 5,767 ships, 16,22 million passengers and a cargo volume of 171,28 million tons.
Chen Winter Yuan, deputy director of the Three Canyon Navigation Administration, said that the "scheduling procedures" have a positive role in promoting the integrity of gate management,ining the order of navigation in the two dam hubs, mitigating the pressure on vessels in the dam zone and improving navigation capacity.

Second, in addition to hazardous chemicals, the products licensed by the quality and technical supervision department of the people's government at the provincial level (market supervision and management department) are subject to post-site inspection, and after the enterprises submit the application and product inspection qualification reports and make the commitment to ensure product quality safety, they can obtain a production license through formal inspection, and then accept the field inspection within the prescribed time.

To give full play to the role of third-party social organizations to ensure the quality of industrial products.
To improve the standard system, give play to the industry's supervisory advantages, strengthen the responsibility of "who examines, who supervises", dynamically evaluate the risk of product quality and safety, reduce the catalogue in a timely manner, downgrade the approval authority or switch to certification management.
In September, China's comprehensive PMI ratio rose and manufacturing PMI ratio fell.
Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics showed that in September, China's comprehensive PMI output index was 54.1%, higher than the previous month and annual averages of 0.3 and 0.1 percentage points, indicating that Chinese enterprises' production and business activity overall remained stable.
That month, the manufacturing production index and the non-manufacturing business activity index, which constituted the comprehensive PMI output index, were 53,0% and 54,9%, respectively.
Among them, China's manufacturing PMI was 50.8%, and the ratio fell by 0.5 percentage points.
Zhao Qinghai said that this month's manufacturing PMI has five main characteristics:
The manufacturing industry is generally stable.
In the 21 industries surveyed, PMIs in 14 industries are located in the expansion range, with manufacturing PMIs such as pharmaceutical, specialized equipment, electrical machinery equipment all at a higher operating level of more than 53.5% and rapid growth.
The second is small volatility in supply.
The production index and the new order index were 53,0 percent and 52,0 percent, down 0.3 and 0.2 percentage points, respectively, from the previous month, with supply and demand continuing to remain in a dynamic state, but the expansion slowed slightly.

Nagoya, November 5 – Japan’s central bank chairman, Black田东彦, said on Monday that the central bank was aware that the long-term implementation of ultra-liquid monetary policies could squeeze financial institutions’ profits and potentially undermine the stability of the country’s banking system.
But he said that given low inflation and uncertainty in overseas economies, the central bank needs to maintain its massive stimulus program while closely monitoring the benefits and disadvantages of its policies.
“The central bank of Japan fully acknowledges that under the ongoing monetary easing, the strength of financial institutions will be increasingly affected,” Deng Xiaoping said in a speech to corporate leaders in Nagoya.
He said that if financial institutions are more proactive in taking risks to offset the effects of years of low interest rates that have shrunk profits, the banking system could become turbulent once a serious negative impact occurs.
“While these risks are not significant at the moment, the central bank will closely monitor developments and encourage financial institutions to take the necessary measures,” he said.
Japan’s central bank meeting records released earlier on Monday showed that the Japanese central bank’s policy committee discussed the rising cost of long-term easing policies at its interest rate meeting in September.
The meeting records showed that one commissioner said that if the economy continues to expand, “the central bank of Japan will have more room for policy resilience in the future.”
The meeting records showed that another member said that given the limitations of the duration of the policy, the committee should discuss how long the central bank of Japan can maintain the stimulus policy.
Japan’s central bank will assess the financial risks posed by the easing policy, while also considering the uncertainty surrounding Japan’s economic outlook, which could affect global demand due to trade friction and rising protectionism.
“The impact of such issues on the Japanese economy is temporarily limited,” said Black田东彦.
“But how the problem continues, the impact on the Japanese economy may be greater,” he added.
“It is necessary to continue to pursue a strong monetary easing policy while considering the positive and negative impacts in a balanced way,” said Deng Xiaoping.
Despite the increasing disadvantages of radical stimulus schemes, such as long-term low interest rates eroding the profits of financial institutions, sluggish inflation has forced the Japanese central bank to maintain the scheme.
The central bank of Japanined its monetary policy last month; faced with the risks posed by the global trade war side, Deng Xiaoping ruled out the possibility of a recent interest rate hike.
On June 1, 2018, Cardiff, the company logo on Tesla electric vehicles.
Under a settlement agreement, Tesla and its chief executive, Musk, have agreed to pay $20 million in fines to financial regulators respectively, and Musk will also resign as chairman of the company, but remain as CEO.
The settlement agreement would draw a mark on Tesla’s two-month turmoil.
The settlement agreement on securities fraud allegations revealed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Saturday will calm investors.
Investors were worried that a long-lasting legal dispute would only further hit the still losing electric car company.
The SEC charged Musk with fraud on Thursday, saying its August 7 tweet misled investors.
The tweet said he was considering privatizing Tesla for $420 per share and had already obtained funding.
The SEC said the tweets were virtually unfounded, and the market turmoil they triggered damaged investors.
Investors and corporate governance experts say the deal could reinforce Tesla, which has been badly hurt by Musk’s recent actions.
Steven Heim, head of asset management at Boston Common, said the settlement should give Musk more oversight, while not taking any “destructive” measures to drive him out of Tesla.
The asset management company owns shares of Tesla’s battery manufacturer Panasonic.
Under the proposed deal, Tesla will have to appoint an independent chairman, two independent directors and a board of directors to develop controls over Musk’s external communications.
“This matter has been resolved quickly on agreed terms in the best interests of our markets and our investors, including Tesla’s shareholders,” SEC Chairman Clayton said in a statement.
Thursday’s allegations caused Tesla’s market value to evaporate by approximately $7 billion, the company’s market value at $452 billion on Friday, down from GM’s $475 billion.
In the settlement agreement, the SEC withdrew the request to remove Musk from the head of the company.
Many investors say the penalty would be catastrophic.
“I think this is the best possible outcome for all involved,” said Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners, who gave Tesla a “neutral” rating, and called the SEC’s punishment for Musk a “little punishment.”
“He’s still important as the CEO for Tesla.”
Neither Musk nor Tesla have acknowledged or denied the SEC’s allegations in the settlement agreement, nor have they immediately responded to a request to comment.
The settlement must still be approved by the court.

General Secretary Xi Jinping delivered a very important speech at the private enterprise symposium, injecting firm confidence in the private economy's move to a broader stage.
General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that "let entrepreneurs take off the burden of ideas and move forward lightly" has aroused a strong resonance among the vast number of entrepreneurs and innovative entrepreneurs.
Market vitality comes from people, especially from entrepreneurs, from entrepreneurship.
In the 40 years of reform and opening up, there are tens of millions of entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial innovation stories, and the growth of the entrepreneurial group continues to push the Chinese economy forward.
For a while, some people in society have issued statements that deny and question the private economy.
False statements such as the so-called “private economy exit theory” and the “new public-private joint venture theory” have raised concerns and concerns among some entrepreneurs.
Recently, some private enterprises have encountered many difficulties and problems in business development.
For example, changes in the international economic environment have an impact on some export enterprises; rapid adjustment of demand structure brings transformation and upgrading pressure; some policies are not coordinated with each other, policy effects are overlapping, or the way of work is simple, leading to the opposite effect of some initially good policies.
Various factors intertwined, the private economy encountered difficulties, some private enterprises faced difficulties, and entrepreneurs showed a lot of anxiety.
In this context, correcting the misunderstanding, removing the ideological burden of entrepreneurs, allowing enterprises to work hard to develop, the government to work hard to promote development, and concerns market confidence and development expectations, has a profound realistic significance.
The seminar again emphasized the important conclusion of the "three unchanged": "The role and role of the non-public economy in our country's economic and social development has not changed!"
From profoundly promoting simplifying government liberalization, establishing a power list system to creating a rule of law environment to protect the legitimate rights and interests of entrepreneurs, to creating a fair competitive market environment, and shaping an atmosphere of respect for entrepreneurs in the whole society, in recent years, the importance of the Party Central Committee for entrepreneurs and institutional safeguards have been unprecedented.
The seminar also clearly put forward policy initiatives to vigorously support the development and expansion of private enterprises in six aspects, and launched a series of pragmatic actions dedicated to the "light forward" of private enterprises.
These are greatly encouraging for entrepreneurs and give more expectations to all sectors of society.
The fog has been removed, the direction has been determined, the key is to implement.
We must continuously create a better development environment for the private economy, help private enterprises solve the difficulties of development, help to China's economic transformation and upgrading; we must make entrepreneurs feel fair in market competition, feel safe in legal business, feel respect in social life, stimulate innovation vitality and creative potential.
China's economic entry into the process of high-quality development requires more entrepreneurs to show their ambitions, but also provides greater space and stage for entrepreneurs to play their creativity.
We have reason to believe that with further deepening reforms and removing barriers, the private economy will have better development prospects and development opportunities, and will move towards a broader stage.

According to the analysis, this increase is linked to the increase in the number of young people in China who make food hot sales easier, as well as the increased attention of young people to nutritional meals.
The data was released by the South Korean Agriculture and Aquaculture Food Circulation Commune (aT) on May 5.
Last year, South Korea's chicken soup exports to China amounted to $10,03.39 million, weighing 2,18.5 million kilograms, rising by 2094% and 3668.8% respectively from 2013.
Analysts believe that the increase in sales of Korean chicken soup in China is related to the increase in empty nest youths to facilitate hot food sales, as well as the increase in young people's attention to nutritional meals.
As of this year, China's single-family household has broken the 200 million mark, and is expected to increase to 30% of the total population in 2020, and local food companies have also been targeting "singular" to launch a variety of convenient foods.
In addition, the analysis also said that avian influenza is the biggest factor in hindering chicken soup roots in the Chinese mainland market.
According to aT, a bird flu outbreak in South Korea occurred in November 2016 to April last year, and relevant departments completely banned the export of chicken soup to China, leading to a sharp reduction in exports.
In 2016, chicken soup exports to China amounted to $84 million, and due to bird flu, last year's exports fell to $100,000.

National Day Celebration Ceremony at the Gate of the Vietnamese Border River
“I can’t imagine such a majestic and spectacular flag-lifting ceremony on the border is more shocking than watching the flag-lifting in the mainland.”
On the morning of the 1st, Mr. Zhang, who came from Sichuan to travel to the Yunnan River port of the border of China-Vietnam, together with more than 500 troops officers, resident people, and Chinese and foreign tourists watched the flag-lifting ceremony to celebrate the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
River Cut Port is the largest port on the Yunnan section of the Chinese-Vietnam border, located in Yunnan province's Red River State River Cut County, in front of the old street city of Vietnam, belongs to the country's class of port.
With the country's "One Belt and One Road" construction continuing to deepen, as one of the most convenient channels to connect China with Southeast Asia, the exit and entry flow of the river port steadily increased.
At 7:30 a.m. in the morning, the sunshine just emerged, and the limited area of the river gate had gathered local people and Chinese and foreign tourists who came to watch the flag-lifting ceremony.
At 7:45 p.m., the flag-lifting ceremony began in time, the spirit of the team of the River Canyon border inspection station of the National Gate Command was shaken, and the national flag was escorted to the flag-lifting station in a sound pace.
After the commander gave the order to raise the flag, the flagship man strived to wave out an arc, the bright five-star red flag like the "Aigle's wing" generally spread the flag, accompanied by the majestic melodies of the national anthem slowly rising.
“The National Day flag-lifting ceremony at important times such as New Year’s Day, Spring Festival and National Day not only shows the image of China, but also inspires the patriotism of the people of all ethnic groups in the border.”
The soldiers who attended the ceremony said.
It is that the national gate liturgy team responsible for the flag-lifting ceremony at the port of the river is made up of more than 40 officers from various positions at the border inspection station of the river gate, from a three-man flag-lifting group to a large-scale liturgy team, which has experienced more than 60 years of history, since its formation, it has carried out more than 70 national-level foreign activity liturgy tasks.
The newly revised Personal Income Tax Law adjusts the criterion for individual income taxpayers in China from a full year to a full 183 days.
The relevant officials of the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation said on Monday that in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in implementing the new individual income tax law will be to consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for foreigners, including Hong Kong and Macao.
The current regulations on the implementation of the individual income tax law have special preferential provisions on tax payments by foreigners, and individuals who do not have a residence in China but have lived in China for less than one year or more for less than five years, whose income comes from outside China, can only pay personal income tax on the part of the units or individuals pay in China.
Part of overseas payments do not require personal income tax payments in China.

The profit distributed to foreign investors from resident enterprises in China will be used for domestic direct investment, and the scope of the policy will be extended from foreign investment encouragement projects to all projects and areas that do not prohibit foreign investment.
During the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly, the parties released some positive messages around the Korean Peninsula issue.
South Korean President Moon said North Korea’s “irreversible” resolve to abandon nuclear weapons and said U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un could meet before the end of this year.
The U.S. State Department subsequently said that Secretary of State Pompeo would visit North Korea in October to promote the implementation of the commitments made by the US leader at the Singapore meeting.
From the beginning of this year to the present day, the DPRK has broken the road to dialogue, the leaders of the DPRK and the United States have held meetings, the trend of easing the situation on the peninsula has continued, and the principle of dialogue to resolve the peninsula issue has been upheld.
First, "the essence of the peninsula issue is the security issue" has not changed, and the key to achieving peace on the peninsula is to properly and balancedly solve the reasonable security concerns of all parties, rather than put pressure on each other and emphasize its own demands.
Second, in the dialogue to denuclearization of the peninsula, there are differences between relevant parties on the steps and ways to denuclearization of the peninsula, due to the long-term lack of political trust between the DPRK and the United States, and the "who first who after" game thinking remains strong.
At the opening session of the Security Council on the Korean Peninsula, held at the United Nations headquarters in New York, the different voices of all parties around the issue of sanctions against the DPRK once again highlighted the two points on the peninsula issue "not changed".
U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo insisted that sanctions against North Korea will not be lifted until the Korean Peninsula is fully denuclearized.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov emphasized the principle of “reacting by action”, noting that “the trend of weakening sanctions should be synchronized with the pace of North Korea’s gradual abandonment of its nuclear path.”
There is no doubt that the relevant parties should continue to fully, fully and accurately implement the Security Council resolutions concerning the DPRK, but pressure is not the purpose, and the implementation of sanctions and the promotion of a political settlement are the requirements of the Security Council resolutions, both of which must not be abolished and must not be chosen only one.
As stated by the Chinese State Commissioner and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, given the positive progress of the current relations between the DPRK and the United States, the Chinese side believes that the Security Council will need to consider the timely launch of reversible clauses, thereby encouraging the DPRK and relevant parties to take greater steps towards denuclearization.
Looking back at the past, every progress in the denuclearization and peace process of the peninsula requires sufficient political courage from all sides.
At present, in the face of the growing expectations of the international community to promote the political settlement of the peninsula issue, relevant parties should show political strength, make political decisions, implement commitments and resolve difficulties, continue to move in the same direction, and simultaneously promote the denuclearization process of the peninsula and establish a peace mechanism on the peninsula, jointly opening up a lasting peace on the peninsula.

TOKYO, October 1 - A short-sighted quarterly survey released by the central bank of Japan on Monday showed that the confidence of large manufacturers in September reached the lowest level in more than a year, due to rising raw material costs and a series of natural disasters affecting production, putting companies under pressure.
The survey hardly shows that escalating global trade frictions have undermined the confidence of large manufacturers.
But the risk of a comprehensive trade war undermines the company’s business prospects and could threaten the company’s capital spending.
Active capital spending is a highlight in the Japanese economy.
The survey questioned the Bank of Japan’s view that steady economic expansion would help drive inflation toward a 2% target, despite signs that companies are gradually transferring costs to customers.
“The confidence of manufacturers tends to stagnate due to slowing exports and weak factory output, amid concerns over the global trade war,” said South Korean Chongqing, chief researcher at the Agricultural Forest Chemical Research Institute.
“Confidence is still high, and as corporate profits are improving and prices are rising, I don’t think confidence will continue to decline.”
The short-sighted survey showed that the large manufacturing economy judgment index in September fell from 21 months ago to 19, deteriorating for the third quarter in a row.
The market estimate is 22.
The large non-manufacturing economy judgment index in September fell from the June 24th to the June 22nd, deteriorating for the first time in eight quarters.
The Reuters survey is 22.
The survey showed that the major manufacturing and non-manufacturing industry assessment index for December is expected to remain unchanged.
Investors did not care about the decline in the short-sighted corporate economic judgment index, and the Japanese stock market index N225 rose to a 27-year high on Monday, as the continued devaluation of the yen helped improve the outlook for Japanese companies' export profits.
Capital expenditure is stable.
Despite a decline in corporate confidence, the latest short story highlights firm corporate capital spending plans, thanks to renewed capacity and increased investment in robotics and automation to tackle the labor shortage caused by aging population.
A short-sighted survey by the central bank showed that large enterprises plan to increase capital expenditure by 13.4% in the current fiscal year as of March 2019.
The previous short-sighted survey was 13.6%.
Nanjing said that all enterprise capital expenditure plans to grow by 8.5% this fiscal year, close to the pace of the Japanese bubble economy era.
He said, “There is still room for further growth in capital spending as small raise their earnings forecasts from now on, but this depends largely on the impact of the trade war on corporate confidence.”
The short-sighted survey showed that the capacity of enterprises to transfer costs has increased, and the output price index of large enterprises is positive, a high point in the decade, which is an encouraging sign that Japan's efforts to counter inflation have made progress.
The index measured the employment situation of large enterprises touched negative 23, the most tight level since 1992, highlighting the tightening of the employment market.
Benefitting from strong corporate spending, the Japanese economy has rebounded in the second quarter since the shrinkage of 1-3 this year.
But trade frictions escalated in the summer and supply chains interrupted by natural disasters have blurred the outlook for Japan’s economy, which relies on exports.
In US dollars, service imports and exports grew by 16.4%.

The head of the service trade department pointed out that the share of imports of emerging services in 1-8 also gradually increased.
In August, emerging service imports grew rapidly, accounting for a 23.6% share of service imports, up 1.6 percentage points from the same period last year.

The 69th International Astronautical Conference opens in Germany
The 69th International Astronautical Congress opened on October 1 in the Berlin exhibition centre in Germany, attending more than 6,300 astronauts, space agencies and enterprise representatives, expert scholars and young students from all over the world.
In a speech at the opening ceremony, International Federation of Astronautics President Jean-Yves Lagarde said that the global space cause is no longer a minority of countries and institutions involved, and that this year’s attendance has increased significantly compared to the previous one, indicating that more and more institutions and individuals are joining it.
He called on all countries to strengthen cooperation and innovation and jointly promote the development of the space industry.
Zhang Keqiang, Deputy Minister of Industry and Information Technology of China and Director of the National Space Administration, introduced China's space program at the exchange and said China will expand international cooperation in the space field and contribute to the space cause of mankind.
China Space Science and Technology Group, China Space Science and Technology Group and other relevant agencies, as well as a number of representatives of private enterprises, attended the meeting to showcase the latest achievements of China's space industry, including various types of carrying rockets, satellites and space science and technology applications products.
The International Astronaut Conference has been held annually since 1950 and is the largest event in the world’s aviation industry.
The conference will last five days and will be jointly hosted by the International Federation of Astronautics, the International Academy of Astronautical Sciences, the Centre for Applied Science and Micro Gravity Research at the University of Bremen and the International Society for Space Law.
Beijing, November 5 - A press release released by China's Foreign Trade Center on Sunday said the meeting showed China's foreign trade situation remains complex and severe, with 80.6% of companies expect exports to be better than the previous year or stable in 2018.
But considering the continued rise in the cost of comprehensive factors such as domestic raw materials and labor, and the increased external environment of the influence of Chinese-US trade friction, the exhibition enterprises also believe that the export situation for next year cannot be optimistic.
At the closing press conference of the 124th General Meeting, Xu Suan, deputy secretary general, press spokesman and deputy director of China's Foreign Trade Center, said that the number of foreign buyers attending the meeting and export transactions had decreased significantly.
This year’s buyers will meet 189,812 people from 215 countries and regions, down 1.11% compared to the same year.
Export transactions amounted to 2,064,94 billion yuan (abbreviated 298,6 billion yuan), down 1% compared to the same year.
From the market point of view, for Japan, ASEAN ten countries, the “BRICS four” and South Korea, transactions increased by 74.4%, 11.4%, 7.2%, and 2.5%, respectively, and for traditional markets such as the United States, Australia, Canada and the European Union decreased by 30.3%, 8.9%, 7.3% and 0.8% respectively.
In terms of industry, transportation tools, mechanical equipment, building and decorative materials, consumer electronics and information products, bathroom equipment increased by 24.8%, 21.1%, 20.0%, 15.1% and 7.6% respectively, and textile clothing, household appliances decreased by 13.0% and 6.7% respectively.
Xi Jinping said that as the rain and wind indicator of China's foreign trade, the situation of buyers attending the meeting and export transactions data show that China's foreign trade development still faces many uncertain and unstable factors next year.
But with the in-depth advancement of supply-side structural reforms, and the recent introduction of "six stable" and other policy measures by countries and locals, the new momentum for China's foreign trade development is accelerating, and the diversification of enterprise markets continues to make new progress, these are important bases and strong conditions for foreign trade development.
"In combination with various factors, China's foreign trade imports and exports are expected to maintain steady growth throughout the year, and the quality and efficiency will continue to improve."
The General Administration of Customs of China announced that in September, exports increased by 14.5%, imports increased by 14.3%, the trade surplus in September was $316.9 billion, and the export growth rate and trade surplus in September were both the highest since February.
Despite the continuous escalation of trade friction, China's export performance in September is still significantly above expectations, strong external demand, enterprises in the United States before imposing tariffs on exports overwhelming Yuan exchange rate devaluation, or the main supporting factors, also to a certain extent showed the resilience of China's foreign trade, but the China-U.S. trade war on confidence strike, the impact on the industrial chain can not be underestimated, analysts believe China's foreign trade challenges may appear in the fourth quarter or next year.
A Reuters survey revealed that U.S. fund managers suggested increased cash holdings in September and continued to remain cautious as the U.S. and China began the latest round of mutual import tariffs, and there were no signs of easing the dispute.
However, according to the 12 fund managers involved in the survey, the asset allocation in North America has increased to its highest since June 2017, while the UK and the euro area, especially emerging markets, have declined.
The global share distribution ratio averaged 56.6 percent and the bond ratio 35.5 percent, basically in line with the survey of last month.
The most noticeable change was that the cash distribution ratio rose to 5.1%, the highest since December 2014.
A fund manager for a large fund company said, “Some economic data brings confidence to the markets, but trade wars are still the biggest concern, so it’s best to be prepared to enter when the markets fall back.”
But fund managers still prefer stocks, especially U.S. stocks, in September, even though U.S. stocks are considered overpriced.
Today, China's open landmark Shanghai, the world's first large-scale national-level exhibition with the theme of imports - China International Import Expo, officially opened in expectation.
An exhibition is like a “window” that gives the world a better understanding of a city and a country.
Through this “window” to the Expo, people see a “open China” to a higher level; with the help of this “window” to the Expo, the world welcomes mutual benefit and win-win with “reform and opening up” China.
"For a country, opening up is like breaking a butterfly, although it will experience a moment of pain, but will be replaced with new life."
General Secretary Xi Jinping’s summary of the path of opening up highlights an important reason why China can.
Looking back on the 40 years of reform and opening up, China has dared to get into the world market, although it has encountered twists and waves, but always faces all risks with an open gesture, continuously releases its inherent momentum, and continuously improves competitiveness.
It can be said that China, using its own achievements, has strongly interpreted the value and meaning of openness.
Standing at a new historical starting point, holding the exhibition with the theme of imports is a major decision made by the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core to promote a new round of high-level opening up to the outside world, is China's initiative to open the market to the world, is China's support for economic globalization and trade liberalization practical action, showing the strong and clear will that "China's opening doors will not be closed, but will only become bigger and bigger".
The listing of exhibitors from all countries and the position of "a difficult one" is the biggest affirmation and best response to China's development of an open economy in a wider range, wider fields and deeper levels.
More importantly, the current global economic and trade order is at a crossroads.
Some countries have erected high walls of trade protectionism and returned to the old path of unilateralism, increasing the international community’s concerns about the prospects of free trade, and adding many uncertainties to the warming world economy.
In the context of this era, the event at Huangpu Jiangsu reflects China’s defense of free trade, and allows the world to see China’s self-confidence and responsibility in opening up markets and sharing the future.
Fast alone and far away.
China, with its open minds and its embrace of the world, has not only promoted its own development, but also brought overwhelming “China opportunities” to countries and regions around the world.
In recent years, China has advocated and promoted the joint construction of the "Belt and Road", initiated the establishment of the AIIB, established the Silk Road Fund ... China has provided a series of international public products, provided tangible export markets, development opportunities and jobs, so that companies from all countries can take advantage of China's development of "express cars" and "cars".
The Expo is also such a public product, a major platform for global economic and trade cooperation.
On top of this platform, more than 3,000 companies in more than 130 countries and regions, with all characteristics of high-quality products and services, take a new step in the Chinese market.
In addition to domestic, domestic consumers also benefit.
By building this "preferred preference" platform, it provides multi-channel high-quality supply for consumption upgrading, to meet the individual, diversified and differentiated consumer needs of the people.
With China's opening doors getting bigger and bigger, goods flow smoothly, things use them, and the step towards a better life will be more solid.
From a more macro perspective, the significance of the Expo has gone beyond the scope of economy and trade, but looking to the future, communicating the ideas of openness, inclusion, universality, balance and win-win, forming a consensus to jointly respond to today's challenges.
If the world is good, China can be good; if China is good, the world is better.
We look forward to bringing glory and success to the world; and we look forward to moving towards a higher level of "open China" with the world to build a bright future of a community of human destiny.

More than 90 percent of Brazilian women voters say the presidential candidate did not consider the needs of women.
Data released by the Brazilian National Geographic Institute (IBGE) recently showed that more than 90 percent of Brazilian women don’t think presidential candidates consider women’s needs.
At present, the number of women in Brazil has reached 1.07 billion, and if the whole of Brazil's women were brought together to form a single country, the country would rank 13th in the world, twice the total population of Spain.
In Brazil, the number of women voters accounts for 52% of the total number of voters, with men accounting for 48%, while the proportion of women among voters is very high, but in the Brazilian parliament, the proportion of women accounts for only 10%.
Of the world’s 193 countries, Brazilian women’s participation in politics is ranked only 154th, higher than Arab countries.
After more than 20 years of fighting for rights, Brazilian women still fail to get their rights.
Brazilian sociologist Natalia Mori points out that this phenomenon exists because of the combination of ancient patriarchal societies, racism and capitalist values.
“Politics should have been based on national democracy, citizenship, identity, access to public goods, and a society made up of multiple social groups, but Brazil’s politics belongs to the monopoly of a certain group and the majority of the population is not represented.”
A previous study by the Locomotiva Institute also found that 94% of Brazilian women do not feel that the politicians who were elected represented their rights, 90% of Brazilian women disagree with the decisions made by the politicians, and 93% of women disagree with the current government policy.
“We need to reverse the problem of underrepresentation of women in parliament, and Brazil’s political system is still affected by inequality.So far, there is still severe gender, class and racial discrimination in Brazil’s political sphere,” said Natalya Mori.
Despite the lack of women’s rights, most women in Brazil still believe in the power of democracy.
The survey showed that 76% of women believe they can play a role in democratic elections, and 72% of women are interested in politics.
In addition, 55 percent of women believe that democratic politics is the best way to make women suffer less of bias.

It is that the new terminal building of Guilin Airport can meet the peak flow of 4,000 people entering and leaving ports per hour, and applied intelligent luggage separation systems, security integrated platforms, facial recognition and other "smart airports" technologies, and planned a variety of business areas including catering, shopping, tax-free and leisure entertainment.
With growth in Europe, Asia and emerging markets largely unstimulating, the United States is increasingly becoming a major engine of global growth.
On September 23, 2018, a container cargo vessel stopped in a port in New Jersey, USA.
But as U.S. current growth is driven by fiscal stimulus, the country’s economy is also being closely watched by the outside world.
“As the U.S. is restoring full employment, a recession is inevitable.”
The only question, he said, is when it will happen and, in his opinion, it may only be not pushing back in advance.
While Barclays is optimistic about the U.S. economic outlook until the end of the year, the bank acknowledges that it’s harder to make predictions for the longer term.
“In the absence of the potential for more sustainable investment growth to boost economic growth, current fiscal-driven growth will be difficult to follow up,” said Barclays in a study report.
“In the absence of investment growth, the risk of a hard landing in the economy will rise in 2020,” they said.
A series of corporate surveys will roughly show that the major economies are in the economic cycle phase at the end of the third quarter.
The Eurozone and U.S. manufacturing industry survey, scheduled to be released next Monday, will be taken into account and the service industry survey will be released on Wednesday.
But next week’s data will inevitably focus on non-agricultural U.S. employment data to be released next Friday, which will provide clues about whether a tight job market is driving wage growth.
Its importance, not only because it is important for the profitability of and consumers’ purchasing power, but also because wage jumping or triggering overall inflation rises, could upset U.S. Federal Reserve officials.
“Salary will be very concerned as it is likely to rise significantly again compared to the previous month.
The rise in September may not break 3 percent over the same period of the previous year, but we can fully expect a breakthrough next month,” the Dutch International Group (ING) economist wrote in a study.
Europe’s politics could be a source of market volatility as holidays in China and other parts of Asia lead to the region’s data slashing next week.
The Italian government has ignored previous financial commitments made to the EU and the other EU member states will have to quickly determine whether they will firmly oppose Italy’s decision.Tria does not support the decision and he hopes to abide by EU rules.
With Brexit negotiations entering a crucial phase, the Conservative Party may also be on fire at its annual meeting in Birmingham.

After the ship is built, it will be delivered to China's National Oceanic Administration's East Sea Branch for use, China's Ministry of Natural Resources' Marine Early Warning Monitoring Division Observatory Director Chen Yuan said that the ship will be put into use and will have a major significance for the development of China's offshore marine observation system and the promotion of global marine observation.
On September 29, China's first 3,000-ton-class large floating vessel "To Yin Red 22" landed in China's armed ships group.
When the ship is built, it will break the bottleneck of equipment currently in China's large-scale floating, submarine placement, recycling, repair and other security work.
The "Sea Red 22" wheel is mainly used for float/submarine regular inspection maintenance, regular dispatch, recycling, float/submarine emergency dispatch, recycling, repair and other safeguards, while having the ability to carry out comprehensive marine investigation tasks such as cross-face investigation.
The new vessel is 89 meters long, 18 meters wide, 7.2 meters deep and has a navigability of 10,000 nautical miles.
Wang Yonglong, deputy general manager of the armed ships group, said: "The Yongjiang 22 ship is China's first large-scale float operating ship, and it is also the only domestic work ship with the capacity to hang ten meters of large float operating, which will further enhance China's large-scale float protection capabilities."
It is understood that the ship will be delivered to China's National Oceanic Administration's East Sea Branch for use after construction, and China's Ministry of Natural Resources' Marine Early Warning Monitoring Division Observatory Director Chen Yuan said that the ship will be put into use and will have a major significance for the development of China's offshore marine observation system and the promotion of global marine observation.
The vessel also has large-scale floating and maintenance operations, but also has ocean comprehensive investigation capabilities, and is the first of China's first comprehensive vessel specifically used for the floating operations and ocean comprehensive investigation.
With such a floating operating vessel, our ocean observation and ocean investigation will have a powerful tool in the future.”

Influenced by the typhoon "Tang Me", the strong wind in the port pool continues, the maximum wind speed is even up to 24, the launch signal was delayed from 1 p.m. on the 30th almost 90 minutes, the wind speed is still not seen to decrease, the event president judged Anne Mdrant to announce the cancellation of the first day of the game, and the game was postponed to the afternoon of October 1.
“The strong winds blowing from the shore continued, and the sea conditions were really too severe.”
Mdrant explains: “In such a situation, no one knows when the wind will blow to the racing boat.
Close to the city’s playground, with the current situation, cancellation of the game is the wisest option.”
There is still some disappointment for all the prepared crew.
“The boat is ready to stop, and we are in good condition.”
Qingdao driver Max Richardson said: “But I know the change of time is the right choice, and I hope today the winds are smaller and we can get a hand.”
Omika Wilkinson, known as the “Star of Hope” for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics team of New Zealand, said: “Wasting a day of time instead makes the game more interesting.
Because today's game score will increase and there are only two days left.
Everyone will be very hard.”

Despite the continuing global financial market shocks, the Hong Kong Financial Administration said on Monday that the foreign exchange fund’s investment revenue in the third quarter of this year decreased by 97% year-on-year but performed better than in the previous quarter, because under the US-China trade war, overseas stocks rose high and foreign exchange losses also narrowed.
According to the latest data of the Central Bank of China, the Foreign Exchange Fund recorded investment revenue of 1.6 billion Hong Kong dollars in September 2018, which is significantly lower than the 618 billion Hong Kong dollars in the same period last year, but better than the revised 100 million Hong Kong dollars in the second quarter of this year.
At the legislative meeting, Chen DeLong, chairman of the China-U.S. trade war, Hong Kong and emerging markets stock index in contrast with the U.S. stock index, until the end of September and early October after the U.S. stock market index continued to peak, the market sentiment began to reverse, because investors gradually realized that the trade war was unfavorable to the United States itself.
“The change in market sentiment is a good thing, and if a trade war has only one-sided effects, it doesn’t help much in resolving things.”
But he also noted that “if the US-China trade war fails to resolve, financial market volatility will continue to rise.”
In the third quarter of this year, the foreign exchange fund's share investment losses in Hong Kong narrowed by 8% to 4.7 billion Hong Kong dollars compared to the previous quarter, overseas equity investment earnings grew by 172% to 12.8 billion Hong Kong dollars; foreign exchange losses of 16.2 billion Hong Kong dollars, bond earnings of 9.7 billion Hong Kong dollars, a quarterly decrease of 24% and 31% respectively, mainly reflecting the general rise of the dollar against major currencies in the quarter and the U.S. interest rate in mid-September.
The Foreign Exchange Fund is mainly used to support the Hong Kong dollar.
Since 1983, Hong Kong has implemented a linked exchange rate system with the Hong Kong dollar.
Regarding the current financial situation in Hong Kong, Chen said that economic and asset market uncertainty increased and downside risks increased, but Hong Kong's financial system is stable, also good defence and earthquake resistance.
“Hong Kong’s international investment position is abundant, with a net asset value of $1.4 trillion equivalent to four times GDP, 2.5 times higher than Singapore and 0.6 times higher than Japan, enough to cope with the downward cycle or reversal of the economy.”
In recent years, the interest rate of the Hong Kong dollar has continued to fall and expand with the dollar interest rate difference, Chen said that the Hong Kong dollar exchange price on September 21 had risen by more than 400 basis points, the market is generally believed to be mainly related to the rise of the Hong Kong dollar interest rate, after which the Hong Kong dollar to the US dollar at the level of near 7.80-7.84, to the recent Hong Kong dollar interest rate rate continued to fall, with the US dollar interest rate difference expansion, may attract the market to the Hong Kong dollar, buy the US dollar interest rate activity increase, so that the Hong Kong dollar again triggered the weak exchange guarantee for a period of time.
But he believes that with the start of the interest rate hike cycle of the Hong Kong Bank, the normalization of the Hong Kong dollar interest rate is underway, and the situation will change in the future that the Hong Kong dollar interest rate is lower than the dollar interest rate.
“The trend of the Hong Kong dollar rate and the dollar rate will be more consistent, and we must be more careful in managing risk and prepared to deal with market volatility.”
Due to the abundance of funds in the Hong Kong dollar, the disbursement of the Hong Kong dollar further dropped, the three-month disbursement of the interest rate fell 0.9% to 2.08179% on Monday, with the dollar interest rate gap expanded from 46 base points to 51 base points; the one-month disbursement of the interest rate was a five-month low, with the dollar interest rate gap expanded from 120 base points to 127 base points.
Between May and mid-September, the current exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar most of the time was close to $7.85.
During the period, due to interest rate activities and large bidding activities after the completion of some bidding income funds flowed out of the Hong Kong dollar and other factors, leading to weak exchange guarantees after the first in April was triggered, in May and August was triggered again and again.
The Central Bank of China purchased the Hong Kong dollar at the level of 7.85 in accordance with the exchange rate system to maintain the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.
In May and August, the Bank of China purchased approximately $52.1 billion under the weak-party exchange guarantee mechanism.
Does the new tax law provide benefits to foreigners?
The relevant person in charge of the Ministry of Finance and the General Administration of Taxation responded to a reporter's question on the 30th, saying that in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in implementing the new individual income tax law, will consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for foreigners including Hong Kong and Macao people.
A reporter asked that the newly revised individual income tax law adjusted the criterion for taxpayers of individual income tax residents from a full year to a full 183 days.
Are there any preferential arrangements for foreigners, including Hong Kong and Taiwan, when implementing this law?
The current regulations on the implementation of the Personal Income Tax Law have special preferential provisions on the payment of taxes by foreigners, and individuals who do not have a residence in China but have lived in China for less than one year or more for less than five years, whose income comes from outside China, can only pay personal income tax on the part paid by Chinese units or individuals.
In order to maintain policy stability, the next step in implementing the new individual income tax law will be to consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for foreigners, including Hong Kong and Macao.

The National Administration of Market Regulation recently launched the 2018 national "quality month" series of events, and reporters came to a five-star moon center in Tianjin to visit the certification experience of mother and baby care services.
The general month centre provides newborn care, nutritional meals, postpartum repair plastics and other services.
In this month center, reporters saw that nurses daily inspected the breastfeeding situation of newborns, and professional nurses provided fine care services such as bathing and touching for newborns.
At the same time, in order to meet the needs of new mothers, from early wound care in the moon, to late-term cosmetic care in the middle of the moon, and other services, China medical treatment and beauty and other care programs are provided to help mothers recover.
A new mom who lived in the house told reporters that she had only booked the meeting room eight months in advance.
The service project directly affects the degree of comfort during the maternal menstruation and the physical recovery, some small-scale menstruation can only provide some simple menstruation services, there is disinfection hygiene irregularity, easy cross-infection, dietary non-scientific problems.
The head of the Moon Center said they were the only five-star lunar center in Tianjin to be certified as a Level B service.
“While some customers don’t initially understand the meaning of Level B certification, it’s important for the long-term development of the company to benefit customers by forcing strictly standardized process management through certification,” he said.
Pan Liffen, deputy director of the Department of Certification and Supervision of the General Administration of National Market Regulation, said that service certification is a new type of certification system based on customer perception, attention to the level of satisfaction of the organization's quality management and service characteristics, is an important component of the national quality infrastructure, and has a positive role in improving the proportion of quality service supply and enhancing China's international competitiveness of services.
Since 2004, after more than 10 years of development, the service certification project has undergone a gradual development process, such as financial service certification, maternal and child care service certification, after-sales service certification, e-commerce service certification, healthcare service certification, etc.
According to the statistics of the National Bureau of Market Supervision, China currently has more than 130 service certification agencies, more than 2,000 service certification personnel, and almost 8,000 effective certification certificates.
Panliffen said that it is necessary to further guide and promote the development of service certification, gradually expand the service certification coverage in health, education, sport, finance, e-commerce and other fields, and promote the supply-side reform and quality improvement of the service industry.
Hong Kong, November 5 - Hong Kong's building prices dropped for two consecutive months after the peak, and Chen DeLang, president of the Hong Kong Financial Authority, said on Monday that it still takes time to observe whether the building market has entered a downward cycle, and if confirmed, it could consider a timely policy of tightening reverse cycle measures.
Chen also pointed out that if the price of buildings rebound, the first affected will be the people in the building market during the peak, but it is expected that there will be a sharp fall in the price of buildings, such as the 1997 Asian financial storm, and the opportunity of citizens to significantly cut prices for the sale of property is much lower.
At the briefing of the Legislative Assembly, Chen Dilling, who led several senior members of the Gold Bureau, said that if the building market is confirmed to enter a downturn cycle, it can be appropriate to take successive easing measures.
“But we’re only seeing a few weeks of data right now, and it’s too early to say relaxation, and there’s still more time to see if the building market is entering a downward cycle.”
Since 2009, the Bureau has so far launched eight rounds of reverse cycle measures to sharply tighten the coverage of all kinds of properties, including reducing the number of exposures, and the applicants must pass strict stress tests to improve bank risk management and shock resistance.
With Hong Kong officially entering the interest rate hike cycle, the Hong Kong-wide private housing price index peaked in September for two consecutive months, and the monthly drop in September expanded to 1.44%.
However, the cumulative increase in the first three quarters of this year still reached 10.2%.
According to the data of the Hong Kong Administration, measuring Hong Kong's resilience to financial risks is still healthy, in the second quarter of this year, the proportion of Hong Kong households unpaid residential housing reached 66%, 60% higher than the average of 2009-11; the average of new loads and new loads and new loads of loads and loads offer and interest ratio is 47% and 34%, respectively, 64% and 41%, respectively, compared with 2009-11.
But Chen DeLin said that the high resistance to earthquakes does not mean that the already established citizens will not be affected by the downturn of the economy, because the property valuation will fall, and those who buy buildings in the peak period will be the first.
While the Bank of China is tightening the lending of banks to mortgage lenders, mortgage lenders can also obtain high-performance mortgage loans through mortgage insurance or by providing mortgage loans by developers.
Chen DeLin said that at present, along with the levy loans offered to developers, borrowers can reach 85-90% by levy, if the price of the building drops by 10%, there will be a negative asset (i.e. the market value of the property drops below the level of the total amount of the unpaid levy).
However, Nguyen Kang, vice president of the Bank of China, pointed out that the authorities estimated that the total amount of high yields provided by developers accounted for only 2-2.5% of the total amount of bank yields, the proportion remains low.
At the peak of negative assets in Hong Kong in 2003, the number of negative assets exceeded 100,000, accounting for 22% of the proportion of building suppliers.
As of the third quarter of this year, Hong Kong recorded zero negative assets for seven consecutive quarters.

It is understood that influenced by many positive factors such as the increase in the country's visa-free policy for Chinese citizens, the number of travellers who use the National Day holiday to travel for holiday shopping in countries such as Europe and Southeast Asia continues to increase.
On the morning of the 1st, the outbound direction of the ports of Lo Lake, Shenzhen Bay, Tsangqing, Fukuda and other ports welcomed the peak of passenger (car) flow, in which the peak of the passenger flow of the port of Lo Lake continued from 9:00 am to 11:00 am, and the peak of the passenger (car) flow of the port of Shenzhen Bay from 6:30 am to 13:30 pm.
In order to respond to the peak of the flow of expatriate (car) passengers, the Shenzhen Border Inspection General Station, in accordance with the unified agreement of the National Immigration Administration, launched the service model for the peak time of the flow of passengers (car), arranged the overtime police force to support the service in advance, opened inspection channels, guided passengers, vehicles to orderly check, ensure that Chinese citizens are in the customs line of entry and exit not more than 30 minutes, while taking into account the efficiency of foreign customs; strengthen the maintenance of order in people-intensive areas, and ensure orderly customs security.

Systemic sclerosis is a chronic disorder that accumulates multiple organs throughout the body and was previously considered to be "incurable".
Due to its mechanism of occurrence is unknown, the diagnosis is difficult, and the lack of effective treatments cannot be cured.
Recently, Liu Wanli, a researcher at the Life Sciences College of the University of Qingdao, and Chongqing National Joint Team, director of the Wind and Moisture Immunity Center at the People's Hospital of the University of Beijing, discovered that there are molecular variations in human immune globules that increase the susceptibility to systemic lupus, and this variation is involved in regulating immune B cells.
In short, the two teams confirmed that an abnormal immune molecule in the human body is a major cause of systemic scabies.
According to one of the authors of the article, Sun Xiaolin of the People's Hospital of the North, the Cheshire National team collected 2,000 large samples of systematic lupus plaque patients and conducted research, and found that patients with immunoglobulin variations produced a wide variety of pathogenic cells and self-antibodies, and the incidence and severity of inflammation such as kidney, arthritis, membranes, and vascular inflammation increased significantly.
Through immune cell tracking, animal testing, sequencing and other various research methods, Liu Wangri team has discovered the pathway of immune signaling that activates this immune molecular variation and promotes the pathogenic mechanism of B cell secretion of various self-antibodies.
The reporter learned that the two teams are strongly united, give full play to their respective advantages, and realize the close combination of basic research and clinical applications.
Liu Wangri's team is dedicated to immunization identification and immunoactivation of B lymphocytes, while Chesapeake's team has long been engaged in the clinical research of systematic macular lymphoma.
“This study is one of the results of years of collaboration between the two teams and is the first academic community to mechanically recognize that abnormalities in immunoglobulin genes will induce systemic sclerosis, laying a solid foundation for further academic research and clinical targeted treatment.”
This is not a shortcut, but a lawful act.
Lawyer carrying a hail in court?
The news was really exciting at first hearing and also exploded in the legal circle.
The Chinese law then fined the lawyer in question with a fine of 500 yuan and proposed in writing that the Spring Town Lawyers' Association investigate the matter.
According to the New York Times, the official notice issued by the Spring Town Law Association said that the two lawyers' actions do not involve violations of the law and will not be punished according to law.
From the viewpoint of many reports, the treatment of the Springshire Law Council was not defending or engaging in confrontation, but received the approval of the Springshire Central Court.
Events that could have triggered tensions within the legal community have eventually been properly resolved.
The reversal of things arises from a more complete restoration of the truth: the axes carried by the lawyers involved are identical to the defendant's murder weapon, the same type, but not opened, only in the proof-quality link as auxiliary evidence, and there is no intimidation or "threatening the security of the court" subjective intention.
To judge whether the behavior of the lawyer involved is illegal, there are four very important details to pay attention: first, the local court before two sessions, showed only a photo of the axle, from a defense point of view, showing the original item of the axle is necessary; second, the axle was only purchased 1 hour before the session, not the lawyer was unwilling to seek the consent of the judge, but objectively failed to contact the judge; third, the entire axle was not overused or improperly used; fourth, the lawyer involved at the first time publicly admitted the mistake, and apologized to the court.
Summarizing these circumstances, it can be seen that the lawyer involved "with the ax to the court" has nothing to do with it, only to defend.
After clarifying the whole fact, the Spring Town Law Council did not push the boat, but made a decision not to be punished under pressure.
This decision is also subject to factual and legal testing.
As for the fact that the axe will be brought to the court without the permission of the court as a tool of control, it is indeed easy to cause unrest and misunderstanding.
For safety and caution considerations, the previous fines and judicial recommendations of the Central Court of Springshire are also inadequate.
In order to safeguard the dignity of lawyers and prevent individual courts from misleading lawyers, the Supreme Law in 2014 issued the "Rules for the Justice Police Safety Inspection of the People's Court", establishing the principle that lawyers do not need to conduct personal safety inspections in court.
Since the rule was issued, the majority of lawyers, as a rule, rarely have incidents that endanger the security of the court due to security inspection vulnerabilities.
In very individual cases such as Springshire, as long as we communicate in the spirit of mutual respect and understanding, misunderstandings are not difficult to eliminate.
As a self-disciplinary organization of the law industry, the Bar Association has a dual mission of punishing lawlessness and safeguarding legality.
In the past, individual law associations suffered from prejudice to punishment, loss of protection, and suffering from illness.
And the decision of the Springshire Association of Lawyers, both in terms of process and outcome, is worthy of praise, setting an example for more of the Association of Lawyers to properly perform their duties.
What taxes will affect our pockets from October 1st?
The new individual income tax law will be implemented from January 1, 2019, in order to allow the broad masses of the people to enjoy tax reduction dividends as early as possible, and from October 1, the taxpayer's actual income from wages will be deducted at the starting point of 5,000 yuan per month, and the new tax rate table will be applied.

The tripartite trade agreement will bring new opportunities to 500 million people.
A joint statement released on the Canadian government website by Foreign Minister Freeland and U.S. Trade Representative Lighthizer said that the U.S., Canada and Mexico have reached a tripartite trade agreement, which will be called "USMCA" (the U.S.-Mexico Tripartite Agreement).

The outcome of the early elections to Okinawa governors due to the death of former governor Yongzhi, who died from illness, was announced early on the morning of 1st local time, opposing Yongzhi Danny, who had planned to relocate a U.S. base in Japan, was successfully elected.
The election was held on September 30, and the final result showed that Yuzhou City won a total of 39,6632 million votes, making Okinawa county governor election the most recorded vote in history, more than its main campaign opponent Zhao Xi Jinping more than 80,000 votes.
A total of four candidates participated in the election, with a voting rate of 63.24%, down 0.89 percentage points from the 2014 Okinawa County Governor's election.
On the 1st, Yue said to the media that the election results showed that the people of the county did not want to waste the efforts of the governor's lifetime, he will inherit the legacy of the governor and continue to make efforts to the Japanese government and the U.S. government to oppose the U.S. military base relocation plan and the closure of the universe base.
The U.S. military base, located in Okinawa county Iyeon Bay City, has long suffered from the disease, and the Japanese-U.S. government had previously agreed to relocate it to the outlying area of Okinawa, but the people of Okinawa strongly opposed it, hoping to move the base completely out of Okinawa.
In response to the county people's strong opposition to the relocation plan and the demands for the withdrawal of permits for landfill on the outskirts of the coast, Yue said that he did not at the beginning stand in an opposing and divided position with the central government, hoping that the two sides could fully exchange opinions, showing the intention to resolve through consultation.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also told the media on Tuesday morning that he seriously accepted the outcome and will make efforts to revitalize Okinawa and reduce the burden on bases.
Japan's chief of staff,菅义伟, said at a press conference on Monday that there was no change in the government's policy on moving the U.S. military base as soon as possible.
At the same time, he also expressed hope for talks with the city.
He will officially become the governor of Okinawa County on April 4.
Since the mid-2000s, as China’s demand for oil seeds grew, farmer Paul Thomas of North Dakota has grown more and more soybeans in his land.
The shift reached its peak this year, when he planted 1,600 acres of soybeans on 5,000 acres, reaching an unprecedented scale.
But Thomas and many farmers like him plan to transplant the former main food crops in the U.S. agricultural area: corn and wheat in 2019.
U.S. farmers have grown more soybean than corn this year, for the first time in 35 years.
The planned transition to other grain crops is because U.S. farmers are struggling to sell soybeans in the context of U.S. President Trump’s trade war with China.
China typically buys about 60% of U.S. exports of soybeans, but because of the trade war, almost zero purchases of U.S. soybeans in recent months have caused soybeans to fall to a decade low.
Thomas plans to grow more wheat next year and hopes to earn more by reducing its reliance on crops that rely on China’s demand.
Thomas said soybean prices “have given us a painful blow.”
He said that without Chinese buy-in demand, the price of soybean near its farm is $7.10 per puddle, while the price required to cover costs is $8.50.
U.S. farmers have grown a record high of soybean this year, and harvest is also expected to reach a record high.
It was at such a very vulnerable moment that they were hit by a trade war.
In response to Trump’s tariffs on imported Chinese goods, China imposed tariffs on imported U.S. soybeans in July.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture will publish a first estimate report on next year’s crops, which will include considerations of the impact on tariffs.
The forecast is expected to confirm the civil agency’s expectation of a decrease in soya seedage.
According to a report seen by Reuters, Inform Economics predicted on October 19 that the corn plantation area will increase by 4% to 9.2 million acres (3.7 million hectares) in 2019 and the soybean plantation area will decrease by 7% to 8.3 million acres.
Informa also predicts a 4% increase in U.S. wheat cultivation.
The area of soybean grown before retaliatory tariffs came into effect this year has risen to 8.9 million acres, up from about 15 million acres a decade ago.
The corn cultivation area has increased by less than 5 million acres since 2008 to 8.9 million acres, with this year's wheat cultivation area of 4.7 million acres, close to the lowest level in 100 years.
Aron Carlson, chairman of the Illinois Corn Cultivation Association, has a total cultivation area of 3,600 acres, and he’s spent half this year on growing soybeans, but plans to cut some in the future.
He said it is likely to increase corn-growing areas by as much as 20% on his farm in northern Illinois; the state is the largest soybean-growing state in the United States.
Soybean yields are lower per acre than corn, but fewer fertilizers are needed, which makes the overall cost of growing soybeans lower.
If farmers switch to end-to-end corn, it could increase costs, but it would benefit some, including the Andersons Inc. fertilizer vendor.
Anderson’s chief executive Pat Bowe told Reuters that he expects transplanted corn to be conducive to the use of fertilizers.
Bayer is also expected to benefit from farmers’ conversion of corn.
Stirlava, director of the Bangkok Airport Administration, apologized for a Chinese citizen being beaten at the airport and said Thailand welcomed Chinese tourists and the relevant departments will strengthen management to raise service awareness and avoid similar incidents.
According to the report, on the 27th, Guardman airport security had a body clash with a Chinese man who was denied entry.
Stirlava said that the behavior of the security involved was seriously violated, and the airport administration suspended it and established an investigation committee in accordance with the procedure to investigate the matter, if the matter actually would resign the security.
The Thai immigration agency has arranged for the man to return to China.
Stirlava apologized for the incident that damaged the image of Thailand and said Thailand attaches great importance to the incident, is willing to try its best to reduce the impact on the hit tourists and will send an apology letter to the parties through the Chinese Embassy in Thailand.
He said Corman airport is willing to provide convenience for Chinese tourists to Thailand, and jointly established special entrance passage for Chinese tourists at the five major international airports of Thailand, such as Suwanapur, Coruman, Chiang Mai, Phuket, Jiangsu and other in Bangkok.

Xi Jinping International: Defending multilateralism, China knows how to unite.
At a time of unilateral reversal, international rules and multilateral order are under shock.
To some extent, the confrontation between unilateralism and multilateralism has entered a critical period.
As a responsible big country, China joins the international community to safeguard multilateralism and promote multilateralism.
Faced with the new challenges of the new situation, China has made a loud voice on the development direction and path of multilateralism.
As State Commissioner and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in his General Debate Speech at the 73rd Session of the United Nations General Assembly, multilateralism in the new era should adhere to win-win cooperation, rule-based order, fairness and justice, and effective action.
At the same time, China calls for a global development cooperation pattern complementary to the United Nations as the core, the main channel for South-North cooperation and South-South cooperation, and calls on all parties to work together to build a community of human destiny.
China’s thoughts and voices reflect the mainstream voices of the international community.
As Spinoza, President of the 73rd UN General Assembly, said, “In the current situation, more than ever, the UN needs to promote multilateralism and safeguard a rule-based international system.”
President Lagarde said the international community should continue to firmly uphold the multilateral trade system, adhere to the rules of international trade and resolve differences through consultation.
In recent years, with the adjustment of the contrast of global economic and political forces, some emerging markets and groups of developing countries have emerged, playing a greater role in major international multilateral mechanisms, providing a new development momentum for multilateralism in the face of the wind.
Standing on this dimension consideration, China advocates the construction of a large family rather than compiling small circles, adhering to multilateralism ideas such as consultation and joint construction rather than engaging winners, and complying with the trend of the times, is the inevitable choice to deal with global challenges and solve world problems, representing the common demands of most countries in the world.
There are advanced ideas, more solid actions.
China’s Belt and Road Initiative has become the largest platform for international cooperation.
China has launched international and regional cooperation initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and the 16+1 Cooperation Initiative to promote international regional cooperation, complement existing international systems and order, bring innovative vitality to multilateral cooperation, and contribute to the development of the international order in a more just and reasonable direction.
As a defender of international order and a practitioner of multilateralism, China’s action is becoming increasingly strong on the multilateral stage of the United Nations.
Mediate international hotspots, tackle climate change, participate in peacekeeping actions, vigorously reduce poverty and alleviate poverty, and assist other countries in implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
As UN Secretary-General Guterres said, China has become an important pillar of multilateralism.
As the world’s “trust deficit” intensifies, as populism and polarization rise, this is the world’s most pressing moment for multilateral cooperation.
At this historic moment, the international community needs to join hands to bring consensus into action, resolutely defend multilateralism and jointly promote the building of a community of human destiny.

The fifth "disability voice month" is coming to pay attention to the issue of sexual education for disabled youths - China News Network
In recent years, the topic of sexual education for teenagers in China has been widely discussed, but the challenges for sexual education for teenagers with disabilities remain tough.
Recently, a comprehensive gender education challenge and practical strategy seminar was held in Beijing.
How to provide sexual education to children and young people with disabilities is an important topic of this seminar.
The "Sexual Knowledge, Attitudes and Behavior Report of Disabled Children and Youth in China" released at the meeting showed that the proportion of children with disabilities who suffer from sexual harassment and sexual assault is higher than healthy children.
For children with disabilities and adolescents, more is also given to the "sexual protection" concern in society.
This seminar aims to explore the three aspects of family support, school education and institutional services to promote comprehensive sexual education for children and adolescents with disabilities in China, to provide support to children and adolescents with disabilities from the source, so that they, like others, have the right to enjoy love.
Experts believe that the Chinese public’s awareness of disabled people has remained at an insufficient level.
Influenced by factors such as traditional concepts, China is not sufficiently thorough in the comprehensive sexual education of people with disabilities, especially children and adolescents with disabilities.
However, in recent years, with the support of UNESCO and public interests, the practices and pathways for the comprehensive development of sexual and reproductive health education for people with disabilities in China throughout the cycle have developed favorably.
The report shows that children and young people with visual impairment, hearing impairment, intellectual impairment and physical impairment will have more difficulties in obtaining sexual knowledge and understanding of intimate relationships than ordinary people, but overall has simplified and enriched development.
The "Comprehensive Education Challenges and Practical Strategies for Persons with Disabilities Workshop" is hosted by the Shanghai People's Public Welfare Foundation, the UNESCO Delegation in China, the International Association for Disability Assistance (France) Beijing Delegation, the United Nations Population Fund Delegation in China jointly supported, aimed at the context of the Great Strategy for Healthy China, jointly explore the comprehensive development of sexual and reproductive health education practices and achievement pathways for persons with disabilities throughout the cycle, promote special education and integrated education policy makers, educators, researchers, social services organizations, representatives of parents and other stakeholders to understand the comprehensive international policy of education and the health rights of children and youth with disabilities; for the domestic children and youth with disabilities sexual education practices, strategies, challenges and resources to conduct extensive exchanges, discuss and develop a blueprint on how to carry out comprehensive education in the future for children with disabilities and youth.
Beijing, September 30 - The Central Bank of China on Sunday released short-term net outflows of foreign asset reserves, which showed that as of the end of August this year, the central bank's foreign currency vacant positions on the currency's long-term contracts and futures contracts were zero for 12 consecutive months, and there were not many positions in the month.
The central bank's previous data showed that as of the end of August last year, the central bank held a total of $60.4 billion in foreign currency over long-term contracts and futures contracts, for the fourth consecutive month unchanged; the SDR (special withdrawal rights) valued by the SDR (special withdrawal rights) is 42,76 billion SDR.
Since then, the central bank’s long-term foreign exchange position has remained zero.
The central bank first released the data at the end of March 2016; the data showed that at the end of February 2016, the central bank held $24.38 billion in foreign currency positions on futures and futures contracts and $28.9 billion in empty positions.
The September data released at the end of October of the same year for the first time showed an empty net increase of $164.01 billion to $453.01 billion.
The central bank has previously said that the foreign currency's futures and futures empty positions on the currency mainly reflect the long-term operations carried out with commercial banks to meet the needs of the central bank to meet the long-term operations on the future foreign exchange reserves, and will continue to provide long-term hedge products according to the principle of practical demand, and the long-term operations of the central bank will have a smaller impact on the scale of future foreign exchange reserves.
On the evening of September 20, this year, on the K158 train, in Zhengzhou, the third-graduate Joe classmates took a car to Chengdu.
A gentleman on the train bought without a ticket, but took her seat: “Take a picture.”
Two-hour drive, the train manager persuaded him for an hour still invalid.
Eventually, one of the passengers with the car could not look and pull the gentleman up.
From the point of view of the public opinion, although the end result is mostly that the hegemonians are publicly condemned, administrative punishment by the public security department, and even included in the blacklist of integrity, the public still feels not to "defeat hatred": why not let the hegemonians be punished on the spot?
Why can’t they stop their immoral or even unlawful behavior on the spot and punish them afterwards?
And for the “Hegemon Lord” unreasonable behavior, why only a male passenger “looking down the road” and pulling it up?
The main reason is that only long-distance trains are equipped with passengers, short-distance trains generally do not; even with passengers, passengers are more concerned about the possible relentless reaction of the hegemon without taking compulsory evacuation measures.
Repeated hegemonic events have made people realize that hegemonians must be forced out of place or even punished in order to act as a deterrent.
This requires that our train passengers dare to take vigorous measures in a timely manner, and that trains without police passengers should be deployed as soon as possible to ensure timely stop and combat illegal acts.

To activate rural consumption, we must rely on normalization mechanisms to purify the market, guide healthy consumption demand, and enhance farmers' sense of consumption.
The data show that the consumer potential of rural residents continued to be released, and the retail sales of rural consumer goods grew by 10.5% in the first half of this year, up 1.3 percentage points above the growth rate in cities.
In a poor village in the western county visited, the whole village had only one convenience store, entered the store, some commodities seemed to have met, "Golden Dragon Fish" marked "Golden Dragon Oil", "Wang Doi" became "Wang Milk", "City" commodities.
In these years, similar phenomena are frequently exposed, some rural counterfeit goods alongside names, names are similar, packaging is similar, and the false truth is inevitable.
A consumer survey report released in a western city revealed that the problem is serious for rural traders, with 66% of consumers buying fake goods in suburban supermarkets, of which food accounts for more than half.
Relevant departments repair the rural market, every year shouting, why is "Li Ghost" still repeatedly fighting?
Unlike the urban market, farmers' rights awareness is relatively poor, coupled with many remote rural locations, in blind zones with insufficient regulatory forces, so that counterfeit goods have a fertile soil.
A commodity multi-headed, some departmental pipe prices, some pipe production, some pipe market, cross-function, year-on-year counterfeit, concentrated control of a wind, counterfeit goods escape the wind, and slowly come out, just finished the old vacation, new vacation comes out.
The lack of long-term regulatory mechanisms, rural markets are difficult to purify, illegal costs are low, and profits are large, resulting in some illegal merchants trafficking "up and down the country", and some rural areas have become "disposable markets".
From temperate to low-cost, the vast majority of farmers are moving towards developmental consumption.
Recently, the Party Central Committee and the State Council issued "Some Opinions on Improving the Mechanism for Promoting the Consumption System to Further Stimulate the Consumption Potential of Residents", in which it was proposed to promote the escalation of the consumption of rural residents, with the aim of making the majority of farmers "can consume", "will consume", "dare to consume", so that rural consumption truly flourishes.
On the one hand, we must deepen the reform, eliminate the market regulation and government's multiple and multiple management flaws, improve the food safety and product quality supervision network, and constantly compress the space for rural vacation and holiday sale.
On the other hand, we should increase law enforcement efforts, open up the regulation of "shell blood vessels", and never allow for the spread of false falsehood in the countryside.
The strict punishment of the cave farmers is the protection of the farmers, no matter how much the caveaters hide, should not become the reason for the growth of counterfeit goods, relevant departments should clarify their responsibilities, grass-roots supervision forces sink, which link comes out of the problem, must be investigated responsibility, let the caveaters, the caveaters have nowhere to hide.
Strictly adhere to market access customs, strict qualification review of production operators, keep the market circulation customs, let the products come right, go clear, find ways from the source and root, let the legal distributors operate safely, let farmers buy confidently.
Activate rural consumption to guide healthy consumption needs.
With the upgrading of consumption, many farmers are not only seeking to eat full and eat well, but also to pursue high-quality life such as culture, health and other things, and can not equate the rural market with "low-quality" and "cheap".
This needs to promote the extension of e-commerce coverage to the vast majority of rural areas, smooth access to urban and rural two-way connected sales channels, promote the combination of offline industrial development platforms and online e-commerce trading platforms, support the expansion of new models of consumption to rural markets; promote the organic combination of commercial and commercial logistics with recreational agriculture, rural tourism, and product processing; improve the rural modern circulation network system, optimize the integration of inventory facilities resources, and effectively reduce the cost of rural circulation.
Create a clear and reassured market environment for the countryside, so that farmers' consumption does not bother, rural consumption can be increasingly vigorous, in order to enhance the sense of acquisition and happiness of farmers' consumption.

The reporter learned from the Customs Tariff Committee of the State Council that since this year, after several consecutive independent adjustments, China's total tariff level will be reduced from 9.8% last year to 7.5%, with an average drop of 23%.
Appropriate tariff reduction is conducive to promoting balanced development of foreign trade, promoting a higher level of opening up to the outside world, and is also conducive to the comprehensive use of both domestic and international resources to promote domestic supply-side structural reforms.
This year is the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up, and the initiative to reduce the overall level of tariffs is a practical action to implement the spirit of the important speech of General Secretary Xi Jinping at the Boao Asia Forum, and is also an important measure of China's need to further expand opening up and actively expand imports according to its own high-quality development, this action and initiative shows that China will firmly pursue a mutually beneficial and win-win strategy of opening up, while enhancing its own development momentum, but also make China's development better for the world.

Canada’s gross domestic product (GDP) grew 0.2% over the previous month in July, a surge above expectation, warming up market expectations for the Canadian central bank to raise interest rates next month.
This would be the fifth rate hike by the central bank in more than a year.
Analysts on Reuters visits previously predicted a 0.1% growth.
The Canadian Bureau of Statistics said on Friday that 12 out of 20 industries saw growth.
The data is remarkable because the central bank predicted earlier this month that temporary factors could delay GDP data in the third quarter.
Bank of Canada chief Poroshenko promised on Thursday that the central bank would continue to gradually raise interest rates and watch economic data closely.
The central bank of Canada will announce its next interest rate decision on October 24.
With the Canadian economy boosting and unemployment near record low, the Bank of Canada has raised interest rates four times since July 2017.
Stephen Brown, a senior Canadian economist at Kew macroeconomics, said the country’s GDP is expected to grow by around 2 percent in the third quarter.
“This would be 1.5 percent higher than the Canadian central bank’s forecast, and would therefore be another reason to expect the Canadian central bank to raise interest rates next month,” he said in a report.
The overnight index exchange showed that the market’s forecast for the Canadian central bank’s chance of raising interest rates in October rose from 76.46% to 78.27%.
For the first time in 65 years, the DPRK jointly explored Han Jiang into the sea.
The South Korean Ministry of Defense confirmed on Friday that the DPRK launched a joint expedition to the Han Jiang and Qingxiang waters that entered the port on the same day.
The measure is a preliminary preparation for safeguarding the free navigation of civil ships on both sides.
South Korea's Defense Ministry announced that it was the first time the two sides had jointly inspected the Hangzhou entrance since the 1953 ceasefire agreement was signed.
The DPRK signed a military agreement in September this year and agreed to jointly explore the waters such as Han Jiang’s entrance to the sea in November to ensure future environmental protection and development of tourism in the waters.
In October, the Korean Dynasty planned a joint exploration of the waters at the General Conference.
On November 5, the joint expedition into the Korean waters was officially launched.
The joint inspectorate consists of 20 people from the Korean army and experts.
According to the South Korean Ministry of Defense, during the visit, neither of the two sides carried arms, and it was prohibited to use words to stimulate each other's actions.
“Because there is no military dividing line near the entrance gate, the area was once an unexpectedly high-rise area, but through joint exploration, it will become a new peace zone in the future.”
The waters jointly explored by the DPRK are about 70 kilometers long, with a total area of about 280 square kilometers.
South Korea will send six exploratory vessels to explore the depth of sea water, provide basic information for safe navigation in the waters; after the investigation is completed, navigation maps will be provided for civilian vessels to travel.
The DPRK had held a summit meeting in Pyongyang in October 2007 to reach an agreement on jointly utilizing Han Jiang and Qingxiang entrance to the sea, but subsequent negotiations were delayed due to tensions on the peninsula.
According to the military agreement signed by the DPRK in September, future vessels of the two sides will need to inform each other in advance before navigating in common waters.
