Welsh Assembly Members Worried About 'Sitting Like Fools'
There is panic among some Assembly Members at the proposal to change their title to 'MWPs' (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal arose from a plan to rename the Assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly across the political parties are concerned that this move will invite ridicule.
A Labour MP said his party was concerned that "the name has a similar pronunciation to TWP and PWP".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, 'TWP' means sloth and 'PWP' means feces.
A plaid PM said his group as a whole was "not happy" and that they had suggested other names.
He commented that his group was "open-minded" about the name change, but that it was a short, lexical crossover from MWP to Muppet.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter W is similar to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter U.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting the name change law, said: "The final decision regarding the descriptive term of what the members of the Assembly are to be called will be discussed among the members of the Assembly".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly the power to change the name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public opinion poll, and received widespread public support for calling the Assembly the Welsh Parliament.
Regarding the title of the members of the Assembly, the Commission favored the titles of Members of Parliament or WMPs, but the title of MWP received the most support in the public opinion poll.
It is clear that members of the Assembly are suggesting other names, but the struggle to reach a consensus could be a headache for Presiding Officer Ellen John, who is expected to submit a draft law on the change within weeks.
The Act on Reforms will also include other changes related to the functioning of the Assembly, including disqualification of members of the Assembly, design of the committee mechanism.
When the law is debated, the members of the assembly have the final vote on the question of what they will be called.
Macedonia to vote in referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote is set to settle a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece over its own province, Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to a territory of its own, and has repeatedly rejected its applications for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, the opposition to the name change plebiscite, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Saayev, argue that the name change is only the price of membership in the European Union and NATO.
The churches of Harlem are in trouble as the nuns of St. Martin's are silenced
"Historically, the older people I spoke to said that there was a bar and a church on every corner", Mr. Adams said.
"There are no two today".
He says the absence of bars is understandable.
"Nowadays, people interact in different ways", he said.
"There are no living rooms in bars now for people to go to on a regular basis".
As for the churches, he worries that the money from the sale of the property will not last as long as the leadership hopes, "and will soon be back to where they started".
He added that the remaining biotechnology centres in the area could be replaced by apartment buildings filled with people who are not helping.
"The majority of people who buy rentals in these buildings will be white", he said, "so it will accelerate the day when all the churches close together, because most of the people who move into these rentals are unlikely to be members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations, and Harlem became a black community in 1870, and St. Martin's a decade later.
The first white Methodist church moved out in the 1930s.
The black congregation that worshiped nearby gave the building its name.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a congregation of blacks under the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of small businesses on 125th Street, because the street, a major place for shopping in Harlem, was reluctant to employ or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 caused extensive damage to the building but Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to renovate the building, and they commissioned Carillon.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin's, proudly called Carillon the "Church of the Poor".
In July, an expert who read Carillon described it as something else: "a cultural treasure", "an irreplaceable historical tool".
According to Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, this was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician. Dionizio A. Lind was a black musician who moved to the larger Carillon in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Mary Weather said that St. Martin's Church could not find a replacement for him.
The complex story of architects and contractors has been heard in St. Martin over the past few months, some brought in by the church's almighty leadership, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
Westry, the governing body of the parish, which includes the leaders of Alma, wrote to the diocese in July about their concerns, saying that while Westry had nothing to do with hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese, the issue was that Westry should "pay".
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency in the diocese.
A shark injured 13 boys while diving in California.
On the opening day of the Konchi season, a 13-year-old boy was diving in the sea for Konchi on Saturday, when he was attacked by a shark, authorities said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacons Beach in Encinitas.
While diving in the sea with friends for about half an hour on Sunday morning, Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he heard a boy screaming for help and that he and his friends came to him and pulled him out of the water.
I thought he was making a noise because he was so excited about getting the conch, but then I thought, 'I got the bite!
I later found out that he was screaming, "I got bit".
"His whole jaw was torn open", said Hamel, "and it was the first thing he noticed when he found the boy".
"I called everyone out of the water: there was a shark in the water!" added Hammel.
The child was airlifted to San Diego Rady Children's Hospital, where hospital officials say the child is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Life-guard Captain Larry Gills told the media that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but was determined to be not of the endangered species.
Gills added that the boy had trauma injuries to the upper part of his body.
For investigative and security purposes, the access from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Nesinitas has been closed by the authorities for 48 hours.
Gills noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area but they are not considered endangered.
Sainsbury's to capture the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is set to take on brands such as Boots, Super Drug and Debenhams by opening department store-style beauty shops that employ specialist assistants.
As part of its focus on the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, Sainsbury's plans to open 'Beauty Isles' in 11 stores across the country, and if this proves successful, will open more stores next year, with sales of fashion goods and home appliances in the UK down, but the beauty market is booming.
The investment in beauty is part of the efforts of supermarkets to take advantage of the shelf space used for TVs and microwaves.
Sainsbury's said it would double the number of cosmetic products to 3,000, and the products would include, for the first time, Revlon, SC, Twizerman and Dr. Pow Pow.
Current product lines such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and ButtsBees will also get more space with similarly branded spaces, as seen in shops like Boots.
The supermarket is again introducing a boutique makeup range, with the majority of products being vegan-friendly, and it is such products that are increasingly in demand by young shoppers.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance's shop will be tested at two Sainsbury's stores with discounts, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, south London, and the second will be operational at Sale Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
We now see a trend towards online shopping and buying daily food in small quantities from local convenience stores, which means there is a lot to do to get people to visit supermarkets.
Mike Coop, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said that as supermarket chains compete with discount stores such as Aldi and Lidl, which sell more services and non-food products, outlets will be more like department stores.
Sainsbury's has been opening Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, and has also introduced Habitat Outlets in many stores, and the two chains were acquired by Sainsbury's two years ago, which has added grocery sales and made the acquisition of the chains more profitable, the company says.
The supermarket's previous attempt to revamp the beauty department and pharmacy department had failed.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's experimented with a joint venture with Boot Souma, but the collaboration ended after disputes over the sharing of revenues from chemist stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy follows the sale of Sainsbury's 281 store pharmacy stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
Lloyds will also play a role in the project, adding a unique range of expensive skincare brands including La Roche-Pose and Vichy in four stores, the company said.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, commented: "We have radically changed the look of our beauty islands to improve the atmosphere for customers.
We have also invested heavily in hiring specially trained helpers who provide advice and guidance.
Our range of brands is designed for all purposes, and the attractive atmosphere and convenient locations mean that we are now a cosmetic destination that challenges the old fashioned way of shopping and is indispensable for customers".
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby withdrew from £11m deal
The Dragon's Den star is angry that TV presenter Holly Willoughby has pulled out of a £11 deal with Peter Jones's lifestyle brand business to focus on deals with companies like Marks, Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time to spend on Truly, a brand of home-wear and accessories.
People have compared the pair's business to Gyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old Morning host announced on Instagram that she was stepping down.
Holly Willoughby's last-minute withdrawal from the lucrative lifestyle brand business has taken a toll on Dragon's Den star Peter Jones - Holly Willoughby pulled out of the deal to focus on her new big deals with Marks, Spencer and ITV.
Jones was displeased by the Golden Girl of TV's agreement at a tumultuous meeting at the headquarters of Jones' business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that he had no time to devote to the household clothing and accessories brand Truly because of the new contracts - £1.5 million, people close to him revealed.
The world has compared their business to the Gyneth Paltrow Group, which would have doubled Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune had he stayed in business.
With 37-year-old Willoughby announcing on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of the UK to go to one of her holiday residences.
One news source says: "Truli has been one of Holly's favorites for a long time.
It was a long-term venture that could help finance Holi for the next decade or two.
Holly's decision to withdraw has shocked everyone involved in the incident.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, because the launch of this initiative was supposed to take place soon.
"At Marlowe's headquarters, there's a warehouse full of merchandise for sale".
With a huge investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to fabrics and home furnishings, experts believe the departure of Morning Presenter, one of the UK's most financially capable stars, will be a huge burden for the company and could delay the launch.
This withdrawal marks the end of a long friendship between the two.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin Jones, and his wife, Tara Kapp, were friends for ten years.
Willoughby Truly joined CAP in 2016, with 52-year-old Jones joining as chairman in March.
The couple have been spending the holidays together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's production company.
Willoughby is set to become the brand ambassador for M&S, replacing ITV's I'm a Celebrity host Andy McPartlin.
Sources close to Jones commented last night, "We don't comment on his business dealings".
After a good fight, we fell in love.'
He scoffed at criticism from the media for making comments that some considered "unfriendly to the president" and for raising hopes for the North Korean leader.
Why did the president let it go so far?
Trump joked by imitating the voice of the "news anchor".
"I have left nothing".
Trump said he had praised Kim's interest in a second meeting after the initial meeting in Singapore in June as a major step toward North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But the nuclear disarmament talks have stalled.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ring Yo Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North sees no "relevant response" from the US to North Korea's initial disarmament moves.
He said the US continued to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
In his rally speech, Trump shared a more optimistic outlook.
"We have a good relationship with North Korea", he said.
"We were at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
We have a good relationship now".
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results, such as halting rocket tests, helping free hostages and returning the remains of the American servicemen to their homeland.
He justified his unusual approach in talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy for the president to speak the way he should, but instead of trying to get 10,000 people outside into this limited space, we'll have about 200 people standing here right now", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
The Indonesian tsunami and earthquake devastated an island, killing hundreds of people
For example, after the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that they didn't need their help.
Although more than ten percent of the Lombok population lost their homes, this was not declared a national disaster, but a prerequisite for receiving international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they are clear that there is no need to request international assistance, which is somewhat challenging", Ms Sambang said.
Although Save the Children is assembling a team to travel to Palouse, it is uncertain whether foreign officials will be able to work there.
The Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies should be allowed to contribute to relief operations, said Mr. Sutopo, spokesperson of the National Disaster Management Agency.
Considering the constant earthquakes Indonesia has to experience, the country still remains unprepared to face the scourge of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, it is not a common sight on other beaches.
While the warning is in effect, the apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palouse is likely to trigger the loss of life.
Even in the best weather, traveling to many of Indonesia's islands can be challenging.
Natural disasters make freight transportation more complex.
The hospital ship, which was docked in Lombok to treat earthquake victims, has now departed for Palouse, but it will take at least three days for the ship to reach the site of the new disaster.
During the election campaign, President Joko Widodo announced that he would improve Indonesia's crumbling infrastructure, but he spent money on roads and railways every week.
While Mr. Joko is up for re-election next year, the lack of money has made his administration miserable.
Mr Joko is also facing pressure from the sectarian issues that have been raging in Indonesia, where the country's Muslim majority prefer a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were left homeless as Christian gangs and Muslim gangs clashed in the streets with knives, bows, arrows and other deadly weapons.
See: Comfort goal by Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat to Chelsea in the Premier League, scoring in the 89th minute of Saturday's game at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Zerdán Shakiri when he was about 30 yards from the Chelsea goalpost, at which point Liverpool were 1-0 behind.
Sturridge hit the ball to his left before he hit the post.
This effort was to fly the ball over the box and slide the ball face up to the right side of the net.
The ball fell on Kepa Arizabalaga's body and finally shook the net.
"I was trying to be in that position to get the ball, and always a player like Shaq would throw the ball as far forward as possible, so I tried to make as much time as possible", Sturridge told Liverpool FC.com.
"I saw Kane running, I touched a ball, and then I didn't think much, I took the shot".
Chelsea took the lead at half-time with a 1-0 goal from Belgian Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
In that match, the Blues striker gave Matteo a pass before turning around almost in the middle of the field and rushing to Liverpool's half.
In the middle of the field, Kovacic took a quick 'give-and-go' pass.
Then he led Hazard to the box, and gave Kowaki a beautiful throw.
Hazard, running the line, kicked the ball with his left foot, and kicked the net, passing Liverpool's Alison Becker.
In the group stage of the Champions League, Liverpool will face Napoli at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy, at 3pm on Wednesday.
Chelsea will face the UEFA Europa League in London on Thursday afternoon at 3pm.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said Sunday morning.
Several people are reported to be trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings following the 7.5 magnitude quake, with waves rising as high as 20 feet after the quake, agency spokesman Suetupo Parvo Ngroho told a news conference.
The city of Palo, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, is scattered among the rubble of collapsed buildings.
The woman is dead, the police arrested 32 men on suspicion of murder.
A murder investigation has been launched following the discovery of a woman's body in Brickhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The body of a 44-year-old woman was found with stab wounds at 7.55am in Grayson Muse, John Street, and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police have requested that anyone who has seen or heard anything abnormal in the area come forward to provide evidence.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation is in the early stages, but I would urge anyone living in and around John Street, Brickenhead, who has seen or heard anything suspicious to come forward to provide evidence.
I also urge everyone, especially taxi drivers, to contact us, as there may be some footage hidden in the dash cam footage of the drivers, as such information could be crucial to our investigation.'
The body was found by a resident of Brickham, and her body was found inside a property, a police spokesman said.
Friends who believed they knew the dead woman came to the scene of the crime this afternoon to ask questions about where the body was found.
Police said that the investigation is ongoing and they are ready to inform the relatives and friends of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Muse was trying to get into his flat, but police said people were prevented from entering or exiting the building.
The cab driver got rich when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now being advised that access to the building and outside will take hours to reverse.
I heard a police officer tell me that the whole area is considered a crime scene.
I saw a woman crying at the scene of the crime.
They kept saying, "It's terrible".
At 2pm, there were two police vans inside the cordon and one outside.
A handful of police officers were guarding the block of flats from inside the cordon.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct mail to @MerPolCC, call 101 or call CrimeStoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 by logging in '247 30 September'.
The latest monument to be demolished under the "distorting history" controversy is the Cromwell Statue of Parliament.
The removal of Cromwell's statue should be called poetic justice, because England's cultural relics and religious artifacts were destroyed by his fanatical Puritan followers, as the Taliban did.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr Crick's proposal "foolish" and an "attempt to twist history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, commented: "The current debate over the removal of statues made it imperative that the statue of Oliver Cromwell, erected outside the Palace of Westminster, should become the target.
The iconic massacres during the English Civil War were never ordered by Crowell, nor did Cromwell.
The false Cromwell is now being sacrificed for the events of his predecessor, Thomas Cromwell, in the previous century.
The spectacularly crafted statue of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thonicroft is a testament to the 19th-century opinion of Cromwell and part of the history of a leader that many still consider worthy of being celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was regarded by many, perhaps by many, in the late nineteenth century as the man who, during his monarchy, protected Parliament from pressure from outside forces, more than today.
Whether it is a complete and accurate representation is a matter of ongoing historical debate.
It is indisputable that the conflict of the mid-seventeenth century shaped the development of our nation in the course of time and that Cromwell was the acknowledged individual leader representing one of the two factions that fought to divide it.
His achievements as Lord Protector should be celebrated and remembered".
The pig killed the Chinese farmer.
Local media reported that a pig had attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwestern China.
A man known as 'Yuan' was found dead, with his blood vessels ruptured and bathed in blood, near a pigsty in the market of Lyuanxiu, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer preparing vaccines for pigs in a pig herd in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2015.
Reports say he arrived with a relative from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell his 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and a herd of pigs was found outside.
The relative said there was a big pig in the cage, bleeding from its mouth.
Forensic evidence suggests that the 550-pound pig was the culprit in the killing of the farmer.
The man, who is known as Wu, said, "My cousin's legs were covered in blood, and his legs were on the ground, torn apart", according to the Guang Evening News.
CCTV footage shows Yuan coming to the market to feed the pigs at 4.40am on Thursday.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig that attacked was not the dead man's own, nor was he a relative.
Market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent someone from attacking, and that police had gathered evidence from the scene of the murder.
Reports suggest that his family and market authorities are in talks to seek compensation for his death.
Although rare, there have been cases of pig attacks on humans.
In 2016, a woman and her husband were attacked by a pig on their farm in Massachusetts, and the man was seriously injured in the attack.
Ten years ago, a Welsh farmer was thrown into a 650-pound pig tractor, and his wife saved him by scaring the pig.
In 2012, a Manitoba man who knew about a farmer in Oregon who was killed and eaten by his pigs told CBC News that although pigs are not generally aggressive, the taste of the blood may have been a 'driver'.
"They are playing.
They're picky, they're very inquisitive... and they don't mean to hurt you.
You just have to give them the right amount of respect", the farmer said.
As part of the end of Rosa, heavy rains will spread across the southwestern United States.
According to the weather forecast, Rosa is weakening as it moves up the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring heavy rain across northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
Rosa was blowing at 85 meters per hour as of 5 a.m. eastern time Sunday morning, and was classified as a Category 1 hurricane, standing 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move south by Sunday.
Meanwhile, a cloud cloud is forming over the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward and reaching the west coast of the US. As Rosa arrives on the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it will begin to push heavy tropical moisture north and southwest of the US.
Monday, some parts of Mexico will get 10 inches of rain.
Subsequently, tropical moisture and the approaching cloud cover will react to produce heavy rainfall across the southwest over the next few days.
Rainfall of 1 to 4 inches, causing dangerous flash floods and landslides locally, and possible landslides in the desert.
In some places, particularly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona, heavy tropical moisture can cause rainfall of 2 to 3 inches per hour.
In the southwest, especially over Arizona, rainfall is expected to be between 2 and 4 inches.
Due to the dispersive nature of tropical rainfall, conditions will deteriorate rapidly and there is a possibility of sudden flooding.
It is strictly advised not to go into the desert without a vehicle when there is a threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rainfall, which will turn the slopes into torrential streams, and thunder and lightning, will produce locally turbulent winds and dust storms.
The approaching cloud cover will bring heavy rainfall to parts of the Southern California coast.
Over half an inch of total rainfall is expected, which may result in minor landslides and muddy roads.
This will be the first rainfall in the region this year.
The rainfall will continue to move toward Arizona on Sunday afternoon and Monday morning, and will continue to spread to the states on Monday afternoon and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread in all four directions on Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
With the Arctic Ocean cooling but the tropical wave is really warm and continuing, the US will experience sharp temperature changes throughout October.
Sometimes this can lead to dramatic temperature fluctuations over short distances.
A prime example of dramatic temperature variations across the central United States can be expected on Sunday.
There are about 20 degrees of temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis, Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining summer heat will begin to rise and expand again.
Most of the central U.S. and eastern U.S. are expected to begin October with warmth, with 80 degrees being widely felt from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City's temperature could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of above-average temperatures in the western U.S. through the first half of October.
The Brett Kavanaugh trial was watched by over 20 million people.
The testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused six television networks of sexually assaulting her in 1980, was seen by more than 20 million people.
Meanwhile, while broadcasters have disrupted regular programming for Friday's last-minute switch, political parties continue to distance themselves from the issue, which was made possible by a deal made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI would conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had broken into a high school party and tried to undress him.
Kavanaugh said in his unemotional testimony that he was 100% sure that nothing like that happened.
On Friday, Nielsen reports that more than 20.4 million people may have seen it.
The company counted the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Viewership information from the Met networks that broadcast the news, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network, is not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen has technical difficulties in counting the number of people who sit in offices and watch TV.
If you explain it, it's the same audience size as people watching a football game or an Academy Awards.
Commentators on Fox News strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, which led to an average of 5.69 million viewers across all networks during the entire day's trial, Nielsen said.
ABC is second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS received 3.1 million viewers, NBC received 2.94 million, MS NBC received 2.89 million and CNN received 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
After the trial, public interest in the matter continued to rise.
Flake was the star of Friday's dramatic events.
The office of the moderate Republican issued a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, and on Friday morning, CNN and CBS cameras captured protesters chanting slogans against him as he tried to climb into an elevator for a judicial committee trial.
CNN broadcast live a scene where he stood staring down for several minutes as people spoke to him with hatred.
"I'm standing right in front of you", said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
"You have power when many women are powerless", someone told him.
Flake said his office had issued a statement and that he had more to say at the committee meeting, before the elevator door closed.
Later, when the committee voted to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote, it was broadcast live by all cable networks and broadcast networks.
But Flake said he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would file charges against the nominee next week, which is what the minority Democrats are demanding.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After discussions with Kruns and several other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had force, because it's clear the Republican Party doesn't have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has called for an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister calls Brexit critics 'politics playing games'
In an interview with the Sunday Times, British Prime Minister Theresa May was accused by critics of 'playing politics' and underestimating the national interest' in relation to her plan to leave the European Union.
Prime Minister Theresa May is arriving at the Conservative Party Conference in Brimmingham, UK on 29 September 2019.
The front page of Theresa May's interview also featured an interview with Boris Johnson, Theresa May's former foreign minister, who called the proposal for Britain and the EU to levy tariffs on each other a 'total scandal' and intensified his attack on Theresa May's 'Checkers Plan for Brexit'.
Dayton Simpson, suspected of being responsible for the death of the LSU star, has been arrested by police.
Police have arrested a man suspected of shooting and killing 20-year-old Wayne De Sims, a former LSU basketball player.
The Baton Rouge Police Department said 20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested on a charge of second-degree murder and has been remanded in custody.
Authorities have released video footage of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, who said Sims' glasses were lost during the beating.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene of the murder, and CBS sister station WFB reports that they contained samples of Simpson's DNA.
When Simpson was questioned, police said he admitted to fatally shooting Wade.
The lawyer reports that he's been bonded for $350,000.
A preliminary report of a gunshot wound to the head and neck was released Friday by the East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office.
The department would like to thank the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police Department and the community for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU's Director of Litigation, Joe Aleva, thanked the law enforcement authorities in the area for their "vigilant vigilance and efforts for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-footer grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
The Sims averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
Upon hearing of Wade's death, LSU basketball coach Will Ward said the team was "devastated" and "in great shock" on Friday morning.
"This is what you worry about all the time", said Ward.
Volcanic ash spewed in Mexico City
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern parts of Mexico City.
After the volcano became active and gas and ash were released and registered for more than 24 hours, the National Center for Disaster Management warned Mexican residents on Saturday to move away from the volcano.
The Centre was monitoring multiple noises and companies.
As in Xochimilco, pictures of people with a thick layer of ash on the windows of cars on the outskirts of Mexico City were circulating on social media.
In September 2017, geophysicists noticed an increase in activity at the volcano, located 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital, after an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 struck central Mexico.
The volcano has been active since 1994 and is known as "Don Goyo".
Catalan police clash with separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona following riots between pro-independence protesters and police, and thousands took part in protests to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarization referendum on leaving.
The police action came after a pro-separatist, masked mob threw eggs at police and sprayed powder paint, creating black clouds of dust on streets normally crowded with tourists.
Police used a whip to control the fight, which led to a stampede in the streets.
While pro-independence groups chanted "Never forget, never forgive" for several hours, unionist protesters chanted the counter-slogan "May Spain live forever".
Local media reported that 15 people were treated for minor injuries during the protests.
A year after Madrid declared the October 1 referendum illegal, but Catalan separatists celebrated the referendum, tensions remain high in the free-minded regions.
Although the majority of voters supported independence, the majority of those opposed to partition abstained from the vote, with very few registered voters.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured in clashes that followed the year when police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region.
Pro-independence groups camped all night on Friday to stop the demonstration in support of the National Police.
Although the demonstration went ahead, the demonstrators were forced to choose a different path.
Narcisse Termez, 68, who took part in the separatist protests with his wife, said he no longer had any hope for Catalonia's future in achieving independence.
"We had the best moments of our lives last year.
I saw my religious parents crying with joy at being able to vote, but now we are in the abyss", he said.
Despite a small but significant victory in the last December's local elections, Catalan independence-supporting parties are struggling to maintain their momentum this year, as some of their best leaders have either gone into exile themselves or are in pre-trial detention awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
John Pugh, a 42-year-old mechanic who was recording the protest in support of the police, told a mechanic that leaders from both parties were fueling the dispute.
"Things are getting worse", he said.
Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced on Saturday that he will run in next year's European Parliament elections.
"Standing as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline of democratic values and the repression we are seeing from the Spanish government", he said.
People arrested for car ramming into a house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested following a series of carjacking attacks on a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at about 19:30 BST on Thursday in Ballinagarh Crescent.
Detective Inspector Blemings said the gates and the building were damaged.
There's a chance the crossbow in the car might have been shot.
The Living Stones win 1-0 against the Rangers in Menga's goal.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston led the team to victory
Livingston shocked Rangers by giving Steven Gerrard his second loss in 18 games as manager of Ibrocks.
With Holt's team winning promotion and Hibernian in second place, Dolly Mengele's goal was a different matter.
Gerard's side have gone on without a win in the Premier League this season and next Sunday they face top team Heart City, who are 8 points ahead of them.
Before that, the Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, the Living Stones have extended their unbeaten run in the division to six games, with new coach Holt, who replaced former coach Kenny Miller last month, still undefeated.
Livingstone has squandered the best opportunities offered by the visiting team.
Holt's team should have been far ahead before he scored, as his direct moves presented Rangers with problems in every way.
Scott Robinb Sun cut the opposing team to the face of the goal, but Scott's effort to the face of the goal was wasted, and Alan Leith Gow also hit the face of the goal, but returned Craig Halcett's header.
Livingston, who knew we could confuse the visitors with their performance in the middle of the field, was happy to let the Rangers play in front of them.
And that's how this important goal was born.
Rangers succumbed to a free kick, and then Livingston attempted an opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson delivering the ball to Menga, who scored from the middle of the box.
The Rangers had the ball most of the time at that point, but the home team's defense was unbreakable, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was a stalwart in the net,
Despite the fact that the ball was kicked by Alfredo Morelos, Kelly was unable to play, and the same pattern continued until the second half.
Scott Pitman also tried to score, but the Rangers goal did not yield, and the ball went out of the open field in the Livingston style, but Lit Gaw did.
Although crosses were continually coming to Livingston's box, all was lost, and two penalty claims were dismissed for Halkett's foul and handball allegations against substitute Glenn Middleton.
The 'phenomenon' from Livingston - analysis
The BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony MacRoney Arena
A legendary performance and the result of Livingston.
By continuing to exceed expectations on this upward journey, they have excelled.
Since returning to their top position, the style of play and the team members have rarely changed, but the way he has kept the team together since taking over is to be admired for the excellence Holt has shown.
Holt had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was able to put the well-placed defense in the regular position, and Mengaya kept Conor Goldsun and Joe Worrall active throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked the motivation to fail.
They played great under Gerard, and they've fallen far short of that standard.
They didn't have the ability to finish, and they only managed to get in the face of the home team's goal once, and this game is a warning to the Rangers because they are now down in the points.
Erdogan's mixed reception in Cologne
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany gathered for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday, there were smiles and blue skies.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - a visit intended to improve relations between NATO allies.
They discussed issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
Then Erdogan left for Cologne to inaugurate a giant new mosque.
It is the largest city of Turkish origin outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent the crowd of about 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many Erdogan supporters had arrived at the compound to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurdish - raised their voices, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to Germany.
The protests and cheers reflected the difference between some German Turks seeing the Visitor as a hero and others abusing him as a dictator.
Deptford road accident: motorcyclist killed after being hit by car
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred at around 10:15 BST near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, located southeast of the city.
The driver stopped the car and paramedics examined the passenger, but he died at the scene.
The accident comes months after another cyclist was killed in the same manner on Childs Street, about a mile from the scene of the accident on Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the victim and notify relatives.
The road has been closed and buses have been diverted, and motorists have been requested to avoid the accident site.
Long Lartin Prison: six officers injured in clash inside prison
The prison office said six prison officers were injured in the attack on the high-security men's prison.
Rioting broke out at HMP Long Lartin, Worcestershire, at around 09:30 BST on Sunday, and the rioting is still ongoing.
Specialist "Tornado" officers have been brought in to control the situation, and the clash involving eight prisoners is taking place within a wing.
The officers who suffered minor injuries to their faces were treated at the scene of the clash.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to handle the ongoing developments at HMP Long Latrine.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We will never tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible for violence will certainly be handed over to the police, who may have to spend more time in jail".
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, there were reports that the prison's governor was being treated after an inmate was attacked.
In October last year, prison staff were attacked by inmates with pool balls, and officers trained to control the violence were deployed to the prison to handle the serious encounter.
The threat of Hurricane Rosa (which could benefit drought-prone areas) raises the risk of flash flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It's rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's exactly what's going to happen early next week as the remnants of Rosa move into the desert to the southwest, creating a flash flood scenario.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for areas from western Arizona to eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel in a direct path over Phoenix and arrive in the afternoon with rain.
"Since 1950, only 10 tropical cyclones within 200 miles of Phoenix have brought storms or low pressure!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a storm that struck within 40 miles of the AES border", the National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted.
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated rainfall of up to 5 inches on Arizona's Mogollon Rim.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the Central Rockies and Great Basin, are likely to experience only 1 to 2 inches of rain, but may experience isolated rainfall of up to an inch in total.
In areas where there is no risk of flash flooding, the rain from the rose may be a blessing, as the region is facing severe drought.
While flooding is a serious problem, with the Southwest currently experiencing drought, this rain is likely to be beneficial.
According to the US DROT Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing the second-highest category of extreme drought", Weather.com reported.
Rosa will be the first to make landfall on Mexico's Baja California Peninsula.
The storm, which did not pass the storm's strength, reached peak winds of 85 mph on Sunday morning, 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at 12 mph.
The cyclone's reaction to the cold waters of the Pacific will reduce the strength of the wind.
So, it is expected to hit the coast of Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening with the strength of tropical winds.
Heavy rainfall across parts of Mexico, posing a risk of sudden flooding.
"From Baja California to northwest Sonora, we'll get a total of 3 to 6 inches of rain, with a potential of 10 inches in some places", Weather.com reports.
Then, as a tropical depression, it will move north across Mexico as a tropical storm, then through Arizona, moving into southern Utah on Tuesday night, before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning.
"The main threat expected from Rosa or its residual strength is very heavy rainfall in Baja California and northwestern Sonora and the U.S. Desert Southwest", the National Hurricane Center said.
The rainfall is expected to be accompanied by life-threatening flash floods, landslides in deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Mid Somer Norton attack: four people arrested for attempted murder
Following the discovery of a 16-year-old with stabbed notes in Somerset, three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The teenager was found wounded on the Excelsior Terrace in the Mid Somer Norton area around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
The injured child was admitted to the hospital, and the child's health remains "stable".
Somerset Police said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area of Avon.
Officials requested that anyone with mobile phone footage of the incident hand it over to the police.
Trump says Kavanaugh has endured "a little bit of bitterness and hatred" from the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to protest the ruthless and unjust tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had endured "a little bit of bitterness and hatred" from the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, emotionally denying Christine Blaise Ford's allegation that he sexually abused her when they were teenagers.
Ford testified under oath at trial that his allegation was true.
The president said Saturday that the American people had seen Kavanaugh's "brilliance, quality and courage".
"Every vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for a judge with a decade of public service and the most versatile legal scholar of our time", he told his West Virginia followers.
Speaking about the importance of Republicans voting in the midterm elections, the president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination.
"We are only five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm actually running", he said.
"That's why I run everywhere, fighting for the great candidates".
Trump argued that Democrats are on a mission of "opposition and deterrence".
A senior aide to a GOP leader told CNN that the first major procedural vote on the Senate floor regarding Kavanaugh's nomination will take place on or before Friday.
Hundreds of people have been killed in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami, and the death toll is rising.
At least 384 people have been killed after a massive earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi caused waves to rise and wash away many of the people on the shores, officials said on Saturday.
On Friday evening, as hundreds of people gathered for the festival in the city of Palu, waves of six meters (18 feet) in height hit the shore, destroying everything in front of them and killing hundreds in the flood.
The tsunami was triggered by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"Yesterday when the tsunami threat was raised, people were on the beach, and the victims were people who did not flee immediately after the warning", said Supoto Parwo Ngroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster relief agency BNPB, in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't just come, it washed cars and logs and houses and hit everything on the land", Ngroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled at 800 kilometers per hour (497 mph) through the open sea before hitting the shore.
He said that some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and they survived.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centers in Palouse.
Aerial images released by the Disaster Management Agency showed buildings and shops destroyed, bridges collapsed and mosques covered in water.
On Saturday, the waves continued to pound the coastline after the tsunami ended.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 people.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said Friday's massive earthquake was 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The agency said the geography of the city, which is located on a long and narrow coastline, may have increased the power of the tsunami.
Ngroho said the damage was "extensive" and thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
He said that the bodies of some of the victims were recovered from the rubble of collapsed buildings, 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Ngroho said the deaths and damage could be higher in the coastal area of Donggala, 300 kilometers north of Palu and close to the epicenter.
Communication systems from Donggala were "disrupted without any information", Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live there", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could be worse", the Red Cross said.
The agency was widely blamed on Saturday for not warning of a tsunami in Palouse, but officials explained that the waves were breaking up within hours of the warning.
Amateur footage of a man frantically shouting tsunami warnings to people walking down the street from the top floor of a building is circulating on social media.
Within minutes, the water slammed into the shore, engulfing buildings, cars, and more.
Reuters has not been able to confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami disrupted power supply, and authorities struggled to coordinate rescue efforts as communications systems throughout Palau were disrupted.
The military has begun sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, officials said, but survivors are left without food and other basic facilities.
The city's airport is open for rescue operations only and the airport will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is visiting the shelters in Palouse on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to over 800.
The situation is bad.
World Vision staff members, who survived the tsunami and arrived in the city of Palo, lived in tarpollen tents in the courtyard of their own office, but they went through the sights of destruction, said Mr. Dosebo.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed", he said.
The situation is very bad.
Although relief teams have begun to clamp down on relief efforts, some complain that well-trained foreign volunteers have been prevented from traveling to Palau.
Under Indonesian law, foreign aid, supplies and volunteers can only be used if the government declares a natural disaster a national disaster.
It has not yet been declared a national disaster.
"It is still a provincial disaster", said Auliya Ariani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government declares this a national disaster, we can make arrangements for international aid, but that is not the case yet".
With the second night now passing in Palu after the Friday tsunami, friends and relatives are hoping that those lost will return through the hopeless stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was rescued from an ovarian cyst.
On Sunday, a woman was rescued from the rubble by rescuers, lying next to her mother's body.
Two of the paragliders trained by Gendhon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team for the Asian Games held in Indonesia earlier this month, have been missing in the tsunami.
The others trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional stress", he said.
Shri Gendhon recalled that within hours of the news of the Rova Rova Hotel collapse, the news spread among the paragliding community and he constantly sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu contestants who participated in the Beach Festival.
All the messages received only one gray check mark instead of a pair of blue check marks.
"I think that means that the messages have not been transmitted", he said.
$26,750 was stolen from an ATM in Newport, La., while it was being filled.
According to a press release from the Newport Police Department, in Newport, La., on Friday, a Brinck officer looted $26,750 while filling an ATM.
Detective Dennis McCarthy writes in the press release that the driver of the car was attempting to empty and refill an ATM at the entertainment complex.
While he was working, another "run after the Brink employee", stole the bag of money he was bringing for delivery.
The press release says that witnesses saw multiple suspects flee the scene of the crime, but police did not specify how many people were involved.
Anyone with information about the offenders should contact Newport Police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper goes by the name of "Joe".
Rapper Kanye West changes her name to "Ye".
On Saturday, he tweeted about his name change: "Officially known as Kanye West".
For a time, 'Ye' was West's pseudonym, and he used it as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change of name is set to appear on Saturday night's live broadcast, during which he is expected to release his new album 'Yandi'.
The show's creator said West will replace Ariana Grande, who left the show for "emotional reasons".
West has previously said that the new name is not only an abbreviation of his current professional name, but that the word has religious significance to him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, 'ye' meaning 'you,'" West remarked earlier this year while discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So, I am you, I am us, all of us.
I went from Kanya meaning one to you -- that whatever we are, good or bad or confused, is a reflection of us.
This album is a reflection of who we are".
West is one of the famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs, who was known by various names including Puff Daddy, P Daddy or Daddy, said that his favorite names this year were Love and Brother Love.
Jay-Z, who previously worked with West, changed his name to "No Hyphen" and "No Cap".
Mexican president-elect says he won't use military force against civilians
As the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody retaliation against the students, Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has said that military force will never be used against civilians.
"We will never use the military to oppress the Mexican people", Lopez Obrador said at Tlatelolco Plaza.
On October 2, 1968, forces were pouring into the Plaza during a peaceful demonstration. Some 300 people were killed.
Lopez Obrador also pledged to support the Mexican youth by providing monthly subsidies to students and opening more public universities.
He said that the youth are being drawn into criminal gangs due to lack of employment and educational opportunities.
The US should double its funding for AI.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI practitioner who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple, has called for the US to double the amount spent on research in the field.
Kai-Fuli made the comments following the announcements of AI by various departments of the US government, even though the US does not have an official AI policy.
China last year unveiled a plan to be the world's leader in innovation by 2030.
"Considering the fact that all other countries are far behind the US, doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, and we are looking forward to the next step in AI", Lee said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that doubling funding means the next big AI achievement is likely to be in the US.
Lee, who wrote a book titled "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" published by Huffington Mifflin Harcourt, is currently CEO of Sinovention Ventures, and has invested in China's most important AI company, Face++.
In 1980, he built an AI system at Carnegie Mellon University, defeating the highest-ranked American player, Othello, and later found work as an executive at Microsoft Research and as president of Google's China branch.
Lee praised the impact of US government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next time would be to meet philosophers.
Lee said that researchers in the United States often struggle to get government funding.
"It's not China that takes the best academics, it's corporate companies", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited brilliant individuals from top universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said that immigration policy changes could help support U.S. AI efforts.
"I think people who do PhDs in AI should naturally have a green card", Lee said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China released its "Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan".
Like the National Science Foundation and other government agencies that fund US researchers, China's National Natural Science Foundation also funds people in academic institutions, but the quality of the work of academia in China is low, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, an initiative aimed at engaging stakeholders from both industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a select committee on artificial intelligence.
This month, DAPRA announced that it will invest $2 billion in AI Next.
As for the NSF, it is currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, no action has been taken for months in relation to the US law that calls for the creation of a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the country's name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move intended to see a resolution to a decades-old dispute with Greece that had blocked Macedonia's application for membership in the European Union or NATO.
Greece has a province within Greece called Macedonia, which is a claim to its territory, and has taken the position that the name of its northern neighbor Macedonia represents a claim to its territory, thus blocking Macedonia's applications for membership in NATO or the European Union using its veto power.
The two countries reached an agreement on the proposed new name in June, but the nationalist opposition argues that the name change would weaken the ethnic existence of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign expressed suspicion that this minimum requirement might not be met, as the referendum would require at least 50 percent of the vote to be valid.
The ballot in the referendum read: "Do you agree to membership in NATO and the European Union in accordance with the agreement with Greece?"
The pro-renaming faction, including Prime Minister Zoran Sajev, argues that the renaming is the price Macedonia will have to pay to seek entry into bodies like the European Union and NATO, one of two countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I am here today to vote for the young generation of Macedonia, for the future of the country, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, which means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgievska, 79, of Skopje.
While not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would abide by the results of the referendum.
A name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission said that as of 1pm there were no reports of any irregularities.
However, in the 2016 parliamentary election, when 66% of registered voters registered to vote, the voting percentage was 36 per hour, compared to only 16% in the referendum.
"I came to vote for my children, Europe is our place", said 62-year-old voter Jos Tanievsky in the capital Skopje.
In Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018, Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Saje, his wife Zorica and his son Dushku voted in a referendum in Macedonia on the country's name change, which will pave the way for NATO and European Union membership.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, in front of the tents prepared by the referendum boycotts, fifty-four-year-old Vladimir Kvardakov would set up a small stage and pull chairs.
"We have no objection to joining NATO and the European Union, but we want to join with our heads held high, not through the back door", Kavardakov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can ask China or Russia for help and become part of Euro-Asian integration".
Prime Minister Sajev said that Macedonia, which currently has an unemployment rate of over 20%, will be able to attract the necessary investment and NATO membership.
"I believe that the vast majority will be in favour of the renaming, because 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of EU and NATO membership", Sajev said after the vote.
He said the result of the "Yes" vote would be "a confirmation of our future".
According to a poll conducted by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research on Monday, between 30 and 43 percent of voters participate in the referendum - less than the required percentage.
According to a poll conducted by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research on Monday, between 30 and 43 percent of voters participate in the referendum - less than the required percentage.
Seventy percent of them said they would vote yes.
To be successful, the referendum must have 50% of the votes and then one.
The failure of the referendum will be a serious setback to the policies of the government that came to power last May and is oriented towards the Western world.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero, advancing through the whole line of defence of Britain
Manchester City won 2-0 in Saturday's match at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, with Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling tying the defence of Britain.
Aguera scored in the 65th minute as easily as it seemed stupid.
At the start of this attempt, the Argentine striker was getting a pass in the middle of the field.
Before kicking the ball into the open field, Aguera bounced through three UK defenders.
And then you see Aguera wrapped in four green jerseys.
Aguera dismissed a defender and cheated several defenders in the side of the UK goal face.
Agwara handed the ball to Sterling on the left.
The English forward, however, returned the ball to Aguera as soon as he got it, and then the ball that Aguera hit shook the right side of the net, tricking Britain's goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
"Aguera has retail problems with his feet", city manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We told him about playing for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored at that time".
But in the Premier League fight, Sterling was the one who gave the Sky Blues the initial lead.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
In that game, Aguera got the ball on the British border.
Aguera passed the ball to Leroy Seyne, who was on the left side, with a beautiful throw.
Shane kicked the ball for a while, then passed it to Sterling, who was advancing.
The Sky Blues forward hit the net before the ball reached the boundary.
City will face Hohenheim in the Champions League group stage at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Zinsheim, Germany, on Tuesday at 12:55pm.
Scherzer wants to play Spoiler vs. the Rockies.
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there's no reason to start again.
But Scherzer, who has always wanted to compete, wants to get on the field against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but that will only be a reality if the Rockies still have a playoff mentality, with the Rockies leading one game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies beat the Nationals 5-2 on Friday night, but they're still trying to win their first division title.
"Even if we're playing for nothing, knowing the crowded atmosphere in Denver, at least we'll rub our fingers in the other team's game, which will be higher than any point I'm facing this year.
Why can't I compete?"
The Nationals have yet to announce a starter for Sunday, but Scherzer, who has expressed interest in the situation, is likely to be allowed.
Scherzer, who is set to take the 34th start, threw a bullpin on Thursday, and will be in his natural rest on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's visit to West Virginia
Speaking about the importance of Republicans voting in the midterm elections, the president indirectly referred to the nomination of his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
"The outcome of everything we have done so far will depend on November.
We're only five weeks away from one of the most important decisions of our lives.
It's the biggest -- I'm not running, but I'm actually running, and that's why I'm running everywhere, fighting for the great candidates", he said.
Trump continued, "You see the terrible, terrible terrorist groups of the Democrats, and you see that happening right now.
By whatever means necessary, which you see is trivial and unfair, they are determined to get back to power.
They don't care who gets hurt, who gets trampled for power and control, they want power and control, and we're not going to give it to them".
Trump said the Democrats were on a mission to "resist and prevent".
"What have you seen over the last four days", Trump asked, criticizing Democrats as "full of hate and wickedness and triviality and dishonesty".
When Trump mentioned Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, the audience cheered.
"Do you remember their answer?
Did you pee on the document?
Oh, what.
No, oh, no, I'll wait for that -- that's really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen".
The Labour Party is no longer a broad-based party.
And He will not forgive the blasphemers.
I was not surprised when the Momentum activists in my local party voted to warn me.
After all, I'm the latest in a long line of Labour MPs who have been told they're not welcome - remember, I've said it all out loud.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan, who was a staunch anti-Semite, had the same experience.
In my case, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn on the Takir resolution.
Ironically, Jeremy has disagreed with previous leaders on similar issues, such as responsible economic policy, national security, and Europe.
The notice for Saturday's Nottingham East Labour meeting stated, "We want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For almost all of my eight years as a local Labour MP, Friday night GC meetings were like this.
Sadly, many meetings today are not of this nature, and the promise of "more kind, more gentle" politics has long since been forgotten; indeed, if such a promise ever began.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, with each opinion being assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It started as soon as Jeremy became the leader, and my colleagues, who I thought had similar political views to mine, were hoping that I would go in the opposite direction, take a view on national security and the single market, the European Union, that I would never agree with.
Whenever I give a public speech, regardless of the subject, there is a lot of shouting on social media, some saying that I should be voted out of the MP position, I should quit central politics and I should not be in the Labour Party.
This is not my only experience.
I am certainly luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments I get are politically related.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face sexual or racial abuse every day but never shy away from it.
One of the most frustrating aspects of this era of politics is that the screaming levels are seen as a natural occurrence.
Jeremy Corbyn last week suggested that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
Actually, we are not a broad party anymore, and the party is getting smaller every time there is a "no confidence" resolution, or changes in the electoral rules.
And over the past two years, I've been getting a lot of advice, like, "Lower your head, don't talk so much, and then I'll be real".
But that's not why I'm in politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, and I was provoked by the Thatcher government's lack of tolerance in actually paving the way for my entire school classroom, and I have always tried, as a local councillor or as a government minister, to bring better public services to those in need.
I have never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one at Nottingham Ease will be confused about my policy views and the areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
I have one thing to say to those who are promoting Friday's resolution: as the country moves towards a Brexit that hurts homes and businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my allegiance to the leader of the Labour Party.
But what I really want to say is not to the Nottingham Moment, but to the Labour Party supporters and non-supporters in my constituency: I am proud to serve you, and I assure you that no threat of dismissal or political move will stop me from engaging in what I believe is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: undefeated and in the lead
While the previous two draws may have almost skewed the final result, it is certain that Ayr deserved to win today's, surprisingly interesting Tennent's Premiership match.
These two teams are the top of the table, they are undefeated in the top 10.
In short, it was the team's excellent defense and their courage to test the odds that drove them forward, and coach Peter Murczy has every right to be happy.
"Our ability has been tested in all the matches so far, and they are still undefeated, so I am happy", he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose commented: "The credit goes to the Irish, who were the first to test the odds".
Fraser led by a 14th-minute effort by Grant Anderson, which put Ayr into the lead, but the yellow card given to Scottish captain Rory Hugh for the match, by the Warriors, gave Melrose a chance, but Jason Baggott's effort was not successful.
A penalty put Ayr on the lead, and almost halfway through the game, Clymo had scored a solo try, which allowed Ayr to make the score 17-5 at half-time.
But in the second half, the Melrose started well, and when Patrick Anderson's effort led to Baggott's goal, they were able to narrow the gap to five points.
A serious injury to Ruyarid Nott caused a long stoppage, but when the match resumed, Ayr recovered the jump, and Stafford McDowell's effort led to a climax.
Then the temporary captain of Iron was given a yellow card, and the chance of Melrose in the magic circle of intense stress failed to reach Bruce Colvin.
Although the home side started to bounce again, in the penalty line-out, when Hutchinson was given a yellow card for pushing Climo without a ball, MacPherson made an attempt by bouncing towards the advancing Iron side.
As he did when the match resumed, Climo again made it to the goal, before taking Rowe on a box kick from David Armstrong and sending Gregor Henry to the edge of the field for the fifth attempt of the home side.
Still Game Star looking for opportunities in the restaurant industry
The news came after he was hired as director of a restaurant company licensed by the still game star Ford Kieran, who was about to enter the hospitality industry.
The 50-year-old is playing Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he also co-wrote, and is joined by his long-time comedy partner Greg Hemph.
The star has announced that the ninth series will be coming soon, and will be the show's final series, and it seems Keernan is busy planning her life after Craig Lang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adrift Mon Limited.
The star declined to comment on the news, but a Scottish Sun source suggests Kearnan is planning to focus on Glasgow's "prosperous rental business".
'The sea is ours': landlocked Bolivia hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific
The sailors are patrolling the Rigging-Clad Naval Base in Lampasas.
A navy blue flag is flying over government buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, naval bases are decorated with the same slogan: "The sea is ours by right.
It is our duty to recover it".
Across landlocked Bolivia, the memory of having to cede their coast to Chile in the bloody 19th-century resource dispute remains - the desire to sail across the Pacific once again.
This hope has been there for decades, but it is now reaching its peak, because Bolivia is awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1st, which has been in the works for the past five years.
"Bolivia now has a momentum, solidarity and calm, and the country is certainly looking forward to the outcome with optimism", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the ICJ ruling on big screens across the country, and they hope the tribunal in The Hague will look sympathetically at Bolivia's claim, and they feel that Chile is obliged to negotiate on allowing Bolivia a full-fledged access to the sea, after decades of volatile negotiations.
Bolivia's influential local president Evo Morales - who faces a controversial re-election battle next year - has high hopes for Monday's ruling.
"We are on the verge of returning to the Pacific", he vowed last August.
Some analysts say it is unlikely that the court will rule in favor of Bolivia, because even if the court does, nothing will happen.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no jurisdiction over any matter within Chile's territorial waters and does not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ's decision came just six months after the final arguments were heard suggests that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zarte, a Chilean expert in international law.
Instead of advancing Bolivia's goal, developments over the past four years may have set this goal back.
"The current Bolivian administration has hijacked the current problem of access to the sea", Sarate said.
Morales's aggressive rhetoric, which may have left Chile's positive view of Bolivia, may also have been leaked, they suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to hold talks at times, but after that it will be extremely difficult to hold talks.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velze, the Bolivian representative in The Hague, dismissed the idea that the court's decision was unusually swift.
He said that the verdict on Monday was a wonderful opportunity for Bolivia to "open a new era of relations with Chile" and to "end 139 years of disagreements" over bilateral benefits.
Calsadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - was focusing on the maritime issue for his political gain.
"Never give up Bolivia's right to access to the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"This is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past".
North Korea says that until the United States can be trusted, nuclear disarmament will not happen.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ryong Ho, said the nation would not disarm if it could trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly.
He also urged the United States to be prepared to honour the promises made during the Singapore Summit of Enemies.
His comments came three months after the summit with North Korea's Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo began attempts to resume stalled nuclear diplomatic talks.
Rhee said that the ongoing unrest and the US' obstructionism of the declaration ending the Korean War would only "pipe dream" that North Korea would ever be brought to its knees.
First, Pyongyang is reluctant to agree to the declaration without substantial disarmament action.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
There is widespread uncertainty as to whether Pyongyang is seriously considering abandoning an arms factory, which is likely to be seen as the only way to ensure the security of the nation.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang in preparation for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The latest in a huge collection of hats coming up on the High Street next door is on display at Parish Fashion.
If you want to increase the size of the hat collection or cover the entire veil, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown have launched a line of oversized hats that look crazy for their SS19 collection on the runway.
The totally impractical hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and these designers have brought their eye-catching creations to the ramp.
Valentino's masterpiece was an over-the-top light brown hat with a swamp-like feather-like wide edge on the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included jewel-encrusted turmeric, a magician's hat, and an pineapple - but these hats were not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also illuminated a collection of strange faces, many of which are suitable for use on Halloween.
These attractively colored masks are sewn onto the lips of many, and reminded more of Hannibal Lecter than of horticulture.
One creature resembled a complete scuba diving gear with snorkels and goggles, while another was like a melted ice cream cone.
If you're still into the big fashion craze, you're in luck.
According to the fashion experts, these large-sized hats will soon be available in shops near you.
These big-size hats came in the style of La Bomba, a two-foot-wide, wicker hat, worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajuski.
The cult label behind the impractical hats, which went viral across social media, led to another big creation, a straw beach bag the size of a swimsuit, with models walking around the ramp wearing it.
The Parisian fashion week's La Riviera SS19 collection was created from a standalone, orange-banded raffia bag with a white leather handle on top, and a cut of raffia braids.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage commented to Fimmel: 'I expect to see big hats and beach bags on the High Street next summer - because the designer has made such an impact that it will be hard to ignore the need for oversized accessories.'
John Edward: Global citizens need language skills
Independent schools in Scotland have maintained a track record of academic excellence, with another set of exceptional test results, continued in 2018, and individual and collective success in sports, music and other community endeavours, which have strengthened academic excellence.
Represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) and with over 30,000 students across Scotland, the schools strive to provide the best possible standard of service to students and parents.
The objective of the Independent Schools is to prepare students for higher education ahead, for their chosen careers and for their position as global citizens.
As an education sector where an exemplary school curriculum can be designed and implemented, we see that modern languages will remain a popular and desirable choice within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a person in a language that comes to mind, it goes to his head.
But when I speak to him in his native language, it goes to his heart".
It's a powerful reminder that when you want to build relationships with people from other countries and gain their trust, you can't rely on English alone.
From the recent exam results this year, we can see that languages are topping the league tables with the highest pass rate among independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved Higher Grade A.
Data collected from the 74 member schools of the CIS shows that 72% of students achieved Higher A grades in Mandarin, 72% of students who studied German, 69% of students who studied French and 63% of students who studied Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as key skills that will undoubtedly be needed by children and students in the future.
Languages are now considered as a choice subject in the independent school curriculum and elsewhere, as are STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) subjects.
A survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 per cent of employers cited lack of language skills as a challenging reason for recruiting candidates for positions.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more essential to prepare students for future employment opportunities.
As languages are needed for future jobs, these skills are indispensable in a globalized world.
Whatever career path they choose, if candidates have learned a second language, they will have long-term skills like this, so they will really be favored in the future.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will naturally put a person who knows multiple languages far ahead of the competition.
In 2013, a survey of more than 4,000 UK adults by YouGov found that 75% of them were not able to speak a foreign language well enough to start a conversation, and 15% of those surveyed said that French was the only foreign language they knew.
That's why investing in language learning is becoming important for kids today.
Knowing multiple languages, especially in developing countries, will give children more opportunities to find meaningful employment.
Within Scotland, each school teaches a different language.
While a handful of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, like Mandarin or Japanese, other schools will teach languages that are considered to be important for the UK as we look to 2020.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a handful of languages to choose from within independent schools with teachers who are experts in the field of foreign languages.
While we don't know what the future holds, Scottish Independent Schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children to succeed in life and equips them with the skills they need to succeed.
It is now undeniable that in a global business environment, languages will remain an indispensable and vital factor for the future of the country, and this should be reflected in education.
Of course, truly modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence for children in Scotland.
The fair at the II Footh Bienne.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron is playing for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
This is the end of the fans' wait for LeBron James to make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it has not been decided how many minutes James will play.
"The time will be more than a minute and less than 48 minutes", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Tredell tweeted that James will only play for a limited time.
After the first practice this week, I asked James about the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need pre-season games at this point in my career to prepare", he said.
Trump's West Virginia rally time, YouTube channel
Tonight, President Donald Trump is opening a series of campaign rallies in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five rallies Trump is planning for next week in places with a large following, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
As well as securing the vote for his nominee on the Supreme Court, Trump is also aiming to build public support ahead of the midterm elections in November, as concerns are raised that the Republican Party will lose control of Congress when the November vote takes place.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m. (Eastern Time).
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally live on YouTube below.
Trump is likely to make a reference to this week's trials of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, whose case is marred by a sexual misconduct allegation that the FBI is investigating and the Senate confirmation vote has been delayed by a week.
But the primary purpose of these conference papers is to give the Republican Party a slight lead in the November election.
So, according to Reuters, those familiar with President Trump's campaign said the five rallies next week are aimed at "energising volunteers and supporters as the party seeks to maintain and increase the Republican majority in the House of Representatives".
"Control of Congress is critical to the president's agenda, so as we heat up the campaign, he will visit as many states as possible", a spokesman for Trump's campaign told Reuters, but the spokesman declined to be named.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, tonight's rally, held at the Westbank Co Arena in Wheeling, will attract followers from Ohio and Pennsilvania and get Pittsburgh media attention.
Trump also visited West Virginia last month, making it his second visit to the state after Saturday's rally, which he won in 2016 with more than 40 percent of the vote.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey, who is far behind in the polls.
The fact that Morrissey is forced to lead the polls is not a good sign for him, Simon Heider, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA showcases their fighting spirit to keep up with expectations as they move into Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, the Forums on Saturday afternoon may be what this year's Ryder Cup needs.
While the fluctuating gameplay is entirely a fabricated command, it's something that players actually believe in, especially in games like this.
So, where do they say the advantage is now?
"They were six points ahead, now four, so I guess that's a little bit of a leap for us", Jordan Speeth said as he left the game.
Europe, which is four points ahead in the 12-game series, has the advantage.
However, as Speeth says, the Americans feel that the wind is at least a little in their favor and that there is plenty to be brave about. The performance of Speeth and Justin Thomas is not a small encouragement to them.
Speeth, the deadly player in From Tea to Green, is leading the way.
After two games, the celebrations were even louder when Speeth and Thomas were two points behind, and they made a crucial spit to bring the match to four all-square.
His dog, who won the match in the 15th, received the same cheers, with the chorus telling people he believed the American team was not out of the game.
"What you really need to do is know deeply about your game and worry about it", said Speeth.
That's all that's left for each player now.
18 holes to prove your mettle.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood are the only players to have scored more points than Speedy and Thomas in the last two days, the uncontested history of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's quartet of four-quarter winners, but the twins are not to be mistaken for admirers.
The only pair not to take a bogey shot on a Saturday afternoon was the Hollywoods, but they did not take bogey shots on Saturday morning and Friday afternoon, and then on Friday morning, where they played the final nine holes.
The fact that they are the ones to beat on Sunday, and the way their energy seems to flow from the noisy crowd, is confirmed by the fact that no player is more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari to secure a European chance when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
It's better if they both play different holes at the same time.
However, talking about European glory remains a thing of the past.
Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning show, was handled with difficulty by Bubba Watson and Web Simpson when he paired with Alex Norn.
On the first nine holes, a bogeyman and two doubles pushed the Spaniard and the Swede into a pit they couldn't climb.
But on Sunday, there's no one to pull you out of your hole.
The interaction between the pairs, the advice they give each other, the advice they don't give each other, the way any strategy can change in an instant, is what makes Forballs and Forms so fascinating to watch.
Europe, who have played well as a team so far, are heading into the final day with a good lead, but this foursomes session has also shown that Team USA, which some, especially their country, suspected, has a fighting plan.
Europe with a 10-6 lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe, which emerged from Saturday's Forbes and Foursomes games with a 10-6 lead over the United States, will head into the final day of the Ryder Cup with a healthy lead.
Inspired pairs Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way to a four-point lead at Le Golf National with two wins over the struggling Tiger Woods.
Thomas Jorn's European side, who were trying to regain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American side, who were on the rise in the morning's Forbo, leading the series to a 3-1 victory.
The U.S. won two games and was more resistant to the Forums, but it was not enough.
If Jim Furyk's team wants to keep the title, they need eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who were nicknamed "Mollywood" after a busy weekend, are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points from their first four matches.
They beat Woods and Patrick Reed at the Forbo, then teamed up to beat the self-confident Woods and the American rookie, Bryson DeCamp, at a much stronger 5 and 4.
Woods, who was drawn in two matches on Saturday, has shown explosive brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in the Forbo and Foursomes, including seven in a row.
After a break for the morning's Forbes, Justin Ross, along with Henrik Stenson, returned to the Forums to beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kopke, who were ranked first and third in the world, 2 & 1.
However, on that pleasant, windy day southwest of Paris, Europe could not take it all.
Three-time major winners Jordan Speeth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans on Saturday with two points.
In the Forboles they secured a tough 2-1 win over Spain's John Rahm and Ian Poulter, then in the Forzes Poulter and Rory Meckelroy, missing the opening two holes, came back to beat them 4-3.[1]
Although the Furyk side needed a draw to keep it as the trophy holders, only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team come back from a four-point deficit going into singles.
They've held on to second place for two days, but they're looking to overtake the counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says unilateral disarmament "has no way" because of lack of trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were increasing mistrust in the United States and that there was no way the country could unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Last year, North Korea took "significant steps toward reputation", starting with a halt to nuclear and missile tests, the demolition of a nuclear test site, and a pledge not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology, Ri Yong said at the annual United Nations General Assembly.
"However, we have not seen a similar response from the US", he said.
"We have no faith in our national security without any faith in the United States, and we have no way of unilaterally disarming ourselves in such circumstances first".
While Ri repeated familiar North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to nuclear disarmament, his statement is significant because he did not deny that unilateral nuclear disarmament is not at hand, as Pyongyang has done before; and because they have taken step-by-step steps toward disarmament, Ri is of the view that North Korea should benefit.
Ri noted that Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump issued a joint statement at their June 12 summit in Singapore, in which Kim pledged to work for nuclear disarmament on the Korean Peninsula and Trump promised to ensure the security of North Korea; the summit was the first time an active US president and a North Korean leader had met in Singapore.
North Korea is trying to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has insisted that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposed calls for easing of the existing tough international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US is pushing for 'nuclear disarmament first' and increasing pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal by force, even opposing the 'declaration that the war is over,'" Re said.
"The idea that we are on our knees with sanctions is a pipe dream of people who are ignorant of us.
The problem is that our distrust is growing because of the continuing sanctions".
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader had spoken about at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, referring to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, the minister added: "If it were not for the United States, the Korean Peninsula would not have been a nuclear disarmament zone.
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's present speech was dramatically different from that of last year's UN speech, in which he called Kim "Rocket Man" and told the UN that Trump, who called him "Mr. Devil President", had attempted suicide and that North Korean rockets targeting the US mainland were therefore necessary.
Trump, who threatened to completely destroy North Korea last year, praised Kim at the United Nations this year for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said more steps needed to be taken and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea disarms itself.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no time limit, adding: "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years, five months".
China and Russia have argued that Pyongyang should be rewarded by the UN Security Council for its actions so far.
However, on Thursday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council: "The implementation of the sanctions proposed by the Security Council must continue vigorously until complete, final and verifiable nuclear disarmament is achieved".
The Security Council has unanimously lifted sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to block funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was fruitless.
Although he left Pyongyang saying there was progress, North Korea condemned his "gang-like demands" in the wake of his departure.
North Korea had promised in a meeting with the US earlier this month that it would destroy a missile site and a nuclear complex if the US took similar action.
He said Kim had told him that the same measures were being demanded in Singapore, including the security guarantees and the normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students study a course on getting enough sleep
This year, a new course has been introduced to get more sleep for all students at Harvard University, and is being launched as a fight against the growing culture of "macho" sleeping through the night and learning with caffeine.
One academic found that students at the world's top university often lack clarity on the basics of how to take care of themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Sisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and he believes it is the first course of its kind in the US.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a lecture on how sleep deprivation can affect learning.
'A girl came up to me at the end of the talk and said, 'I'm a senior now, so why are you telling me this?'
She said no one had told her about the importance of sleep - it surprised me", he told the Telegraph.
This course, first introduced this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits are academic, how it helps with latent performance and improves their overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University Health Services, said the university decided to introduce the course after it was discovered that students were experiencing severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
One section has a picture of the door room where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, coaches and books, and hear about the effects of caffeine and light, how it affects latent performance due to sleep deprivation, and the importance of bedtime routine.
Another section explains to students how chronic sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then, a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages students to think about their everyday military routines.
'We know this won't change student behavior immediately.
But just as you have a right to know the health consequences of choosing to smoke, we believe they have a right to know", added Prof. Sisler.
He said that a culture that prides itself on 'learning without sleeping' still exists and that modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that lack of sleep is a growing problem.
Ensuring we get good quality, adequate sleep should be one student's 'secret weapon' against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - when we don't sleep to avoid weight gain, we're pushing the brain into hunger mode, which causes a constant hunger.
Raymond Shaw, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Sisler design the course, which Raymond attended last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He said that this course has opened his eyes and inspired the whole campus to do this course.
As a next step, he hopes to require all postgraduate students to complete a similar programme of study before joining a competition-based institution.
Professor Sisler recommended that students should consider setting alarms to tell them when to go to sleep and when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can traditionally cloud your circadian rhythm and cause problems with sleeping.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Mango's goal defeated Gerard's players
When Dolly Menga's foot left Steven Gerrard's shaky side to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston, the Rangers once again felt the anguish of being away from their regular left.
The Iberbrooks side were looking to record their first away win since a 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team suffered just their second defeat in 18 games as Gerard's manager, which put them eight points behind the unmanageable Hearts of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes before halftime, but it was unlikely that the under-motivated Rangers would fight back.
The Rangers now dropped to sixth, and Livingston moved up to third, just behind Hibernian by a goal.
The fact that the linesman and the stone had to take care of Spence with an object that looked like it was thrown from the rear would make it even harder for the Rangers.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that reached the Betfred Cup Sefi finals after beating Ayr.
Holt, on the other hand, dropped the same Levi 11 that had scored a point from Hearts last week, and the well-trained team must have made him so happy that he was breathless every step of the way.
Although the Rangers may have dominated the position, Livingston handled the ball well.
They should have scored in the second minute of the game when Menga's first league pass sent Scott Pittman to Allen McGregor's goalpost, but that midfielder squandered his big opportunity.
Although a highly skilled freak of Kagan Jacobs approached Captain Craig Halkett, his defensive partner Alan Lithgow was only able to make a shot that bounced back into the back post.
The Rangers took control, but their forward play seemed more hopeful than believable.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he should have been awarded a penalty when he and Steven Lawless clashed in the 15th minute, but the referee, Steven Thompson, rejected the Colombian's appeal.
The Rangers scored just two goals in the first half, but a header from Lassanha Collibaly and a dispassionate kick from Ovie Izzaria did not bother former Iberox goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
Levy's 34th-minute goal may have been against the grain, but if their unity is to be taken into account, no one can deny that they deserved it.
The Rangers have again failed to handle a sophisticated set piece by Jacobs.
When Declan Gallagher delivered the ball to Scott Robinson, Scott Orfield did not respond. Robinson chose Mangan to finish the simple without giving up his composure.
Gerard responded by dropping Ryan Kent in place of Collibaly at half-time. The change was almost immediate. The winger made a move with Morelos, but a heart-rending Kelly ran from his line to stop it.
But Livingston was exactly what kept the visitors entertained, and Lithgow and Halkett took long shots one after the other.
Holt's side could have pulled their lead in the final stages, but McGregor denied Jacobs and Lithgow the opportunity.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton argued for another late penalty when he teamed up with Jacobs, but again Thompson refused.
Panchamang: inventor of the Geiger counter
Now a page from our "Sun Day Morning" issue: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, Geiger's counterpart has become a major reference to science and pop culture, as seen in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans as cowboy scientists:
Man: "What is this plot?"
"This is a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you turn on these earphones, you can hear the effects of radioactivity in the minerals".
"Tell me, I'm sure this is going to blow!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But his invention still bears his name.
A new cancer vaccine will teach the immune system to 'find' shit cells.
A new cancer vaccine could train the immune system to detect and kill shitty cells.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify the clot cells as part of the treatment.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and modifying them in a lab.
Then, they can 'see' a common protein that causes many cancers, and then they can inject these cells back into the patient.
A trial of a vaccine in patients with multiple cancers is showing promising results.
When a woman was treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize scrotal cells, her ovarian cancer disappeared for over 18 months.
This method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a common protein known as HER2, which causes many cancers, and then injecting these cells back into the patient.
"Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine", says Jay Bersofsky, professor at the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
Prof. Bersofsky explained that HER2 influences the growth of several types of cancers, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and colon cancer.
A similar approach, which takes immune cells from patients and teaches them how to target cancer cells, has been successful in treating leukemia.
After her appearance on SNL, Kanye West has been down on the pro-Trump gossip press, wearing a giant hat.
But it's not that Asian.
After a disjointed performance praising US President Donald Trump and saying he would run in 2020, people called Kanye West a hoot on Saturday night's live show.
Wearing a Make America Great hat, after singing the third song of the night, titled Ghost Town, he lashed out at Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Every time I talk to white people, they say, 'How do you like a racist Trump?'
"If I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of the United States a long time ago", he said.
The SNL show opened with a skit starring Matt Damon, mocking the truth-telling angle made by Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee, in relation to sexual assault claims raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not aired, footage of West's nonsense was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear whether Rock was trying to make fun of West by posting this.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he felt too much pressure on the underwear to wear a hat.
"They scared me in the hallway.
They said, 'Don't go in that hat.'
They threatened me!
They say I'm in a sunken place", West reportedly said.
"Do you want to see where it's sunk?" West continued, "Wear my Superman cap because that means you can't tell me what to do".
Try the love".
Hearing his comments, audiences were stunned at least twice, with Koovi and SNL cast members reporting, where one told the publication: "The whole studio fell into a death silence".
West is introduced as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend rapper Mac Miller had recently died.
Many were surprised when West sang "I Love It" dressed as Perrier Bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, the head of conservative group TP USA, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: Thank you for standing out in the crowd".
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just like that, and it was absolutely amazing.
"But I will not decide to reward (buy his music or clothes or support his 'art') someone I believe is inciting and vomiting an ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
So are we", they added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, "officially the same person as Kanye West", West tweeted.
He's not the first artist to change his name, and West is following in the footsteps of Didi, who was also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, P. Diddy.
West's fellow rapper Snoop Dogg changed his name to Snoop Lion, and musical legend Prince, who was previously known as Prince, changed his name to a symbol.
Charged with murder in the Belfast restaurant knife-fighting.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after he stabbed a man at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident happened in Ballyhackmore.
The accused is expected to appear in Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charge will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harrington is attacking the toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is best known for his role as John Snow in the HBO series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old star attacked the stereotype of macho heroes, saying that such roles on screen make young boys believe that they need to be rough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed 'something went wrong' and asked how to address the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married her Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie (31), admitted that she 'strongly' believes the issue needs to be addressed.
'I feel very strongly now personally - where did we go wrong with masculinity?' he asked.
"What are we teaching boys growing up in relation to the problems we're seeing today?"
With so many characters in TV shows that pervade masculinity, Kit believes television is partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity.
He continued: 'What is the natural, what is taught?
What is being taught on TV and on the streets that young boys need certain characteristics to be a man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time: How do we change this?
Because something has gone wrong with the young people.'
He admitted in an interview that he would not be making any Game of Thrones prequels or sequels when the series ended next summer, and that he was "tired of the battles and the horses".
From November, Kit will star in Sam Shepard's remake of True West, a story about a filmmaker and his brother, a bandit.
The star recently revealed that he thinks the best thing he's ever come out of Game of Thrones was meeting his wife, Rose.
"I met my wife on the show, so the show gave me a future family and a life to move on", he said.
Rose played Yegrite, the love interest of John Snow, who played the character of Kit, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
China reports 14% increase in new cases of HIV/AIDS
China reported a 14 percent increase in the number of citizens infected with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, nearly 40,000 new cases were reported.
The majority of the new cases are sexually transmitted, marking a shift from previous cases.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in parts of China as a result of blood transfusions using blood from infected individuals.
However, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province that the number of HIV cases had been virtually eliminated.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing by one million a year.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse among LGBT communities in China is a serious problem.
China decriminalized homosexuality in 1997, although discrimination against LGBT people remains severe.
Studies suggest that because of the conservative values that remain in the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry the women themselves.
Men often spread diseases when they have intercourse because they do not have adequate sexual protection.
As part of efforts to address this problem, since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to make HIV medicines universally available.
Maxina Waters has said that the data of her staff and GOP senators has not been leaked and that such allegations are "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denied on Saturday that one of her employees had posted personal information on the Wikipedia pages of Republican U.S. Senators.
The Los Angeles Democrat stressed that these were just claims made by "far-right" pundits and websites.
"Lies, lies, more vile lies", Waters said in a tweeted statement.
The leaked information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee of Utah, and Orrin Hatch.
The information was posted online on Thursday by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during the Senate panel's hearing on sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came online shortly after all three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pandit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with the Waters office, and that the information of a member of the Waters staff was released.
"This baseless allegation is completely false, completely false", Waters continued.
As a result of these false and false allegations, the identity, personal information and security of one of my employees has been compromised, but my employee is in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This baseless accusation is completely false, completely false.
Waters's statement online drew criticism from those who had been invited, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleisher.
"There is anger in this denial", Fleischer wrote.
This indicates that she does not have the emotional maturity to be a Congresswoman.
When someone accuses you of something you didn't do, you shouldn't get angry.
We must not be arrogant.
Do not question the motives of the accuser.
We need to show calm and cleanliness.
Fleisher was trying to compare Waters's response to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics had alleged appeared extremely angry during Thursday's trial.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate running to oust Waters in the midterm elections, also tweeted his opinion.
"Great event if true", he tweeted.
The Office has notified the appropriate authorities and law enforcement of these false claims, Waters said in a statement.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are brought to light and that they are legally held accountable for all their actions that cause damage or danger to all or any of my employees", she continued.
Johnny English Strike Again review - The powerless spy poof by Rowan Atkinson
It is now common to seek Brexit references in any new film with a British twist, and it seems to apply to this second installment of the 'Johnny English' action-comedy spoof franchise - the franchise that began with the 2003 film 'Johnny English' and was revived in 2011 with 'Johnny English Ribbon'.
Will this counter-narrative self-deprecating about how obviously stupid we are become a new export opportunity for the country?
In any case, the eye-popping, rubber-faced, incompetent Johnny English has a second license to fatten things up - more than just a sophisticated comic creation designed for non-English speaking film audiences.
He is certainly a lazy secret agent, and although he has a range of odd hypocrisy to a smooth charm, a powder of Mr. Beans' imagination and a touch of the imagination of the young man who contributes a single note to the 'Charity of Fire' theme tune at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics made him look like Inspector Clausov.
He is based on the traveller and mystery-loving man who once played Atkinson in the Barclays TV commercials that no one remembers anymore.
There's a good moment or two in this latest Johnny English release.
I liked Johnny English approaching the helicopter, wearing a medieval armour, with the rotating blades sounding loudly for a while on the helmet.
Atkinson's ability to be physically funny is evident in this film, but the humor in it is powerless and oddly overblown, especially in an era when "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now confidently add comedy as an ingredient.
The humor in the film feels more tailored to children than adults, and I didn't feel the wild adventures of Johnny English were more novel or focused than the silent film fun that Atkinson played as Mr. Bean.
The film also touches on the perennial theme of the Great Britain's current crisis.
A cyber-hacker breaks into Britain's super-secret web network and reveals the identities of all British agents working in the field of covert intelligence, disappointing the agent on duty - unfortunately, Kevin Eldon, who plays the agent, has only a small role.
This is the final nail in the coffin for a prime minister who is already politically unpopular, arrogant and hates everything. And while Emma Thompson does a great job of playing this character like this Theresa May, the truth is that she has nothing more to do in the script.
The Prime Minister's intelligence advisers are informing them that since the identity of all the spies active in the intelligence field has been revealed, they need to bring in someone who is retired.
The intended target, a lousy Johnny Englishman, is looking for a job as a schoolmaster in some wealthy institution, but the client is teaching off-the-record lessons on how to conduct undercover operations: Here's some good fun, and it's great that Johnny is teaching the School of Rock-Types Academy English espionage.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an urgent briefing and is reunited with his long-time classmate Bogue, played by Ben Miller.
Bug is now married, his wife is a submarine commander, and Vicky Pepperdine has been destroyed in this 'Jolly-Hockey-Stick' character.
Batman and Robin return to Her Majesty's Secret Service, and 'Work' begins, but things get complicated when they have to face the gorgeous beauty played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls dangerously into the spell of an influential tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: Jake Lacey plays the drunken billionaire Jason Volta.
English and Buff begin a procession of artificial copycats: They set fire to a French restaurant disguised as waiters; they smuggle themselves abroad in Volta's luxury van and make a mess of things; John English tries to use a virtual reality headset to get to know the inside of Volta's house.
They've certainly put all their talent into this part of the film, but it's so gentle and so playful, it's like watching Koch TV on the whole.
It's an average movie.
I still couldn't help but think, when I watched other Johnny English films, that the British film industry couldn't provide a character that matched the genius of Rowan Atkinson.
The Labour Party denied reports that it was planning a scheme to allow British people to work four days a week but pay five days' wages.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a progressive plan that would allow Britons to work four days a week but pay five days' wages.
The party reportedly wants the profits made by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to be passed on by company bosses to workers by giving them an extra day off.
If that happens, employees can enjoy a three-day weekend - but they can still buy their old wages.
The idea is in line with the party's economic agenda and the party plans to tilt the country in favour of workers, news sources say.
As a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy, the Trade Union Congress has endorsed the idea of a four-day work week.
A senior Labour leader told the Sunday Times: "The policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'This will not happen overnight, but the four-day work week is a fitting ambition in line with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers and as the party's overall industrial policy.'
The Labour Party was not the first party to adopt a four-day work week, the Green Party had promised a four-day work week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, at present this ambition is not accepted by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: 'The idea of a four-day week is not party policy and is not considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to explain his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he had decided to take back power from the "faceless directors" and "profits" of utilities.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans mean that current shareholders in white-collar companies may not get their full stake back, as a Labour government could be charged 'deductions' based on perceived wrongdoing.
He confirmed plans to include workers in the company boards and create inclusive ownership funds to transfer 10 per cent of private sector enterprises to employees.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy on "60 Minutes" ask if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh will change their minds.
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, which delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, has raised questions about whether the bureau's findings will persuade any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired Sunday, "60 Minutes C" reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham whether the FBI's finding would lead to a reversal of their decision.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course", said Kennedy.
"I said I was going to trial, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
After this happened, after the allegation came out, I called him and asked, 'Did you do this?'
He showed determination, determination and unshakable character.'
Graham's vote, however, seemed to be set in stone.
"I've made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and it's just an accusation shot", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett has denied it with heroism", Graham added, referring to Christine Balsi Ford.
No one they named could confirm this.
This is a 36-year-old story.
I don't see any change".
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival will be hosted by New York this Saturday, with the annual music event featuring impressive performances by celebrities, as well as a remarkable mission: eradicating poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, tens of thousands of people flock to the Great Lawn in Central Park to attend the Global Citizen Festival, not only to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Prosperity Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against poverty.
To receive a free ticket to attend the event (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concert fans will have to perform a number of tasks or "activities"; these activities include volunteering, emailing or calling a world leader, and other meaningful ways to help raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But with just 12 years to go, how successful has Global Citizen been?
Is rewarding people with a free concert ticket a fundamental way to get people to respond to the call to action, or is it another form of nonprofit called "clictivism" - the state of people who think they're making a real difference by signing an online complaint or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says they have documented more than 19 million "actions" from supporters, helping a platform of different goals.
It says these measures have helped to motivate world leaders to announce more than $37 billion in guarantees and policies, aimed at mobilizing the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the Group has selected 390 pledges and announcements derived from its operations, and has disbursed or funded at least $10 billion.
The group estimates that the money they have raised has directly impacted 649 million people worldwide so far.
One of the key pledges, following more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens, is a $35 million pledge to help end malnutrition in Rwanda. The pledge was made by The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based non-profit of investors and implementers committed to "helping children grow to their full potential".
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like yourself, we can put the social injustice of malnutrition on the back burner", said Tracy Ullman, Power of Nutrition Ambassador, to the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
After taking more than 5,000 steps to call on the UK to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government announced that it will fund the Power of Nutrition initiative, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition.
One of the most frequently asked questions on its website is, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: "It's going to be a long, hard road - sometimes we'll fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights movement and the anti-apartheid movement that is ahead of us, we will win, because together we are stronger.
This year, the event in New York will feature artists Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Moni, and will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Huff Jackman.
US Navy could be used as "barricade" to disrupt Russian energy exports: Home Secretary
Washington, D.C. reports that U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Sinek has revealed that Washington could seek naval assistance "if necessary" to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets including the Middle East.
Sinké accused Russia's intervention in Syria of being a way to seek new markets, noting that Russia is intervening there at the invitation of the legitimate government of Syria.
I believe they are engaging in the Middle East because they want to be a hub of energy in the Middle East, as they do in Eastern Europe and the south of Europe, he said.
According to this officer, there are ways and means to solve this.
With our Navy, the United States has the ability to ensure that the sea lanes are open and remain open, and to block their energy if necessary and ensure that it does not reach the market, he said.
Sinkhe was addressing participants at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that describes itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that in practice they are one and the same.
Describing Russia as a "one-legged pony" with a fossil fuel-dependent economy, he said that "the economic path forward for Iran and Russia is, to a large extent, to make the most of fuels and use one instead of the other".
The Trump administration is on a mission to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, excluding Russia, which would be a much cheaper option for European customers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to back away from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, is making Germany a "prisoner" of Berlin and Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be seen as a tool for pressure and that consumers should have the right to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Mosul in September.
The US position was met with a backlash from Germany, which reiterated its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading trade union, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay out of the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It's a big headache for me when a third country interferes in our energy supply", said Dieter Kemp, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren will make a "firm decision" about running for president in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would make a "firm decision" about running for president following the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed that he would consider running at a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and time demands a woman at the top of the government", they said, The Hill reports.
"After November 6th, I will be serious about running for president".
During the town hall, Warren criticized President Donald Trump, saying he was "leading this country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren was openly critical of Trump and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
"We need an FBI investigation before we can vote", Warren tweeted Friday.
However, according to an opinion poll released on Thursday, a majority of people in Warren's own constituency think Warren should not run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent of the people supported such a contest.
Former Governor Deval Patrick received the most support in the opinion poll, with 38 percent supporting his candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other conservative Democratic leaders discussed as possible contenders for the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a formal decision on running in January, the Associated Press reports.
Sarah Palin referring to the PTSD of the track bridge at the Donald Trump rally
After joining the Army in September, he spent nearly a year in Iraq.
Track Pall was arrested and charged in a domestic assault case Monday night.
"When I think about what my own son is going through and what he went through when he came back, I can understand the plight of other families who are affected by PTSD and other injuries that come with it when our soldiers return home", she said, speaking at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described her son's arrest as the "elephant in the room", saying, "They come back a little different, they come back hard-hearted, they wonder, they wonder if the soldiers and airmen who are with them and every member of the military are getting any respect for what they've given to the country", she said of her son and others who have retired from the military.
He was arrested in Vasilla, Alaska, on Monday and charged with domestic violence against a woman, who was assaulted with a weapon and was intoxicated, according to Vasilla Police Department spokesman Dan Bennett.
18 states and D.C. challenged the new asylum policy.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy denying asylum to victims fleeing gang-related or domestic violence.
In opposition to the new policy and in support of an asylum seeker, representatives from 10 states and the District of Columbia filed a 'front-of-the-court brief' in Washington on Friday.
The full name of the complainant in the lawsuit Grace vs. Sessions, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal policy, has not been disclosed.
She said she was tortured by her partner and "children who are members of criminal gangs", but her application for asylum was denied by US officials on June 20.
They were locked up in Texas.
Attorneys from states supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries with widespread attacks and domestic violence by criminal gangs, and where asylum seekers in the U.S. are coming in large numbers.
The Board of Immigration Appeals in 2014 overturned a U.S. asylum policy that allowed undocumented immigrants who fled domestic violence to apply for asylum.
"The new law is a disregard for decades of state, federal and international law", said Carl Racine, the Attorney General of the District of Columbia, in a statement released Friday.
The "Front-of-the-Court Brief" claims that federal law requires that all claims for asylum be settled based on the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, but that such a prohibition violates that principle.
The lawyers then argued in the brief that the policy of denying entry to immigrants hurt the US economy, saying that asylum seekers were more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary workforce".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June ordered immigration judges to stop giving asylum to people fleeing attacks by criminal gangs and domestic violence.
Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear related to race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion, Sessions said in a policy statement on June 11.
All the problems that people around the world face every day -- even all the serious ones -- shelter was never meant to be the solution.
The search for the stranded has been intensified in Patchill, with the death toll doubling, and rescue operations in Palouse have been ordered.
For those who survived the disaster, the situation was even more dire.
"The pressure is intense", said a mother named Riza Kusuma, 35, while comforting her feverish son at one of the evacuation centers in the bustling city of Palu.
Ambulances are arriving with bodies every minute.
There is no clean water".
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, picking up waterlogged supplies and trying to move whatever they could find to safe routes.
The 7.5 magnitude quake injured hundreds of people and destroyed hospitals.
Some of the injured, including Dwy Harris, who suffered a fractured back and shoulder, rested outside the Army Hospital in Palouse, where patients were treated outside the building due to the continuous strong earthquakes.
Dwayne Harris' eyes filled with tears as he recalled the quake that shook the fifth floor of the hotel where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I think I was crushed by the ruins of the wall, Dwayne Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he and his family had come to the city to attend a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, but then I heard no voice.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're somewhere safe.
US ambassador accuses China of threatening with 'advertising'
A week after a Chinese daily published a four-page ad in a US daily about the bilateral gains of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US media to spread China's propaganda.
Following allegations that China was trying to interfere in the November 6 US congressional elections, the US president referred to the China Daily supplement in the Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa.
Trump's allegation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US election is a new step in Washington's intensifying campaign to pressure China, US officials told Reuters.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, relations between Beijing and Washington have been mired in an escalating trade war, with both countries repeatedly raising tariffs on each other's imported goods.
In the trade war, China had earlier increased import tariffs in retaliation to the US, and the new tariffs were designed to target import firms in states like Iowa, which supports Trump's Republican Party, said the economist in China and the US.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and long-time governor of Iowa and owner of one of the largest exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had offended American workers, farmers and businesses.
"China is now doubling down on the intimidation by publishing propaganda in our own independent media", Bruns Tade wrote in a Sunday Des Moines Register op-ed column.
By placing a paid advertisement on the Des Moines Register, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the freedom of speech and freedom of the press that are nurtured in the United States to spread propaganda, Brandstad wrote.
"In contrast, here at the newsstands on the streets of Beijing, you can see limited voices of dissent, and you cannot see the true reflection of the divergent opinions that the Chinese people may have about China's troubled economic path, because the media is under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He also wrote that his article "slipped one of China's leading newspapers from its promise to publish", but he did not mention which newspaper.
With the Kavanaugh scandal continuing, analysts are predicting a Republican majority of women voters ahead of the midterm elections.
As many leading Republican Party leaders stand with and oppose Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who faces multiple sexual accusations, political analyst Vidhana has warned that the Republican Party will face a setback, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiment around this is so high, most Republicans already seem to want to move forward with a vote.
There is no going back", wrote Grant Rehr, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, in an article published in The Hill on Saturday.
Reehr said he suspected that Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last-minute demand for an FBI investigation would not be enough to placate angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow or in November", Karin Jean Pierre, senior adviser and national women's advocate for the progressive group Movon, said Friday, the Washington, D.C., newspaper reported.
Mike reports that on Friday morning, protesters demonstrated in the Senate corridor, chanting "November is coming!" as the Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination, despite the oath of office of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
"The enthusiasm and inspiration of the Democratic Party is going to be left off the chart", unbiased political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news site.
"People say it's already high; it's true.
But it's still a long way off, especially among the fringe female voters and younger people, ages 18 to 29, who don't like the president but don't often vote".
Even before Ford's public affidavit explaining sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had suggested that there would be a setback if the Republican went ahead with confirmation.
"This is messing up the GOP", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, NBC News reports.
"It's not just about the committee vote, the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be appointed to the bench, but about the way Republicans handled the allegation and how Republicans treated the victim", said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats pick candidates.
However, in the context of the Ford and Kavanaugh sworn sources, Americans seem to be divided on who to trust, and they are somewhat inclined to trust Kavanaugh.
A new opinion poll conducted by Yugaw shows that 41 percent of people believe Ford's oath of office is absolutely or accidentally true, and 35 percent said they absolutely or accidentally believe Kavanaugh.
Furthermore, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh had lied either implicitly or accidentally because of his oath, compared to just 30 percent who said the same about Ford.
Following a request from Flake, The Guardian reported that the FBI is currently investigating allegations put forward by Ford and at least one other wrongdoer, Deborah Ramirez.
Ford was sworn in last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee, saying he had assaulted Kavanaugh himself while he was 17 years old.
Ramirez alleges that while attending a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s, the Supreme Court nominee showed his genitals.
The inventor of the World Wide Web to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a startup that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
InRapt, the latest project in this technology legend, is built on Berners-Lee's own open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store data and which people to allow access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal behind the Input was world domination.
"We need to do it now", he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment".
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or a POD.
It will contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's a technology that allows Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify to be accessed in one browser at the same time.
The unique thing about personal online data stores is that it is entirely up to the user to decide what kind of information which people can access.
The company calls this "personal empowerment through data".
The idea behind InRapt is to be the company that provides the resources, process and appropriate expertise to help make Solid accessible to everyone, says John Bruce, CEO of the company.
The company currently consists of a security platform purchased by Berners-Lee and Bruce from IBM, some on-staff developers and a community of volunteer coders hired to work on the project.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using tools available on the InRupt web site.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook or Google about whether or not to introduce a complete overnight change to their business models.
"We do not ask their permission".
In a post published in the Saturday Media, Berners-Lee wrote that "The mission of Intrept is to provide commercial power and an ecosystem to help preserve the integrity and quality of the new Web built on solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been influential in the debate over net neutrality.
While Input is launched, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
I'm incredibly optimistic about the next era of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard van: Priest remembered for his service in World War I
The only Church of England priest to win the Victoria Cross for his part in the First World War has been commemorated by his countrymen 100 years later.
The award was made to Lieutenant Colonel the Reverend Bernard Vanne for his part in the raids on Bellenglaes and Lehaucort on 29 September 1918.
However, four days later, he was killed by a sniper, never knowing that he had been awarded the highest British military honour.
His two grandchildren unveiled the memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
Michael Van, one of his grandchildren, said the unveiling of the stone, exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning work, was "a vivid symbolism".
According to the London Gazette of 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin, "through heavy snow and bullets fired from the field and machine guns".
He then leapt into the line of fire, displaying "great valor", leaping single-handed into a field-gun column and leading his battalion forward, shooting down three of the enemy soldiers.
A month before the end of the war, on October 4, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper.
"I know I haven't lived up to my grandfather's example of courage", said Michael Van, now 72, "but it makes me humble".
He and his brother Dr. James Van presented a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said he was very proud to play his part in the parade, adding that the support of so many people demonstrates the courage of a true hero.
MMA fans who stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 had to settle for Peppa Pig.
Imagine if you stayed up all night to watch the crowd cheering for the ballot 206 and were denied this important event.
The San Jose-based Bill has 13 fights, including six on the main card, and it is shown live on Channel 5 in the UK at night.
At 6am, as the fight between Gerard Moussaci and Rory McDonald was about to begin, the coverage shifted to Peppa Pig, to the shock of UK viewers.
Those who waited until morning to enjoy the battle were utterly disappointed.
A fan tweeted that the screen shift to children's cartoons was "a kind of dirty joke".
"Because of the government regulation, it's not appropriate to air that content at 6 a.m. and they had to switch to a children's program", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the Pig, yes".
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said that in the future, the company will try to create a schedule that will include more UK audiences.
"When we think about the replay, I think we can solve this problem", said Cocker.
"But it's six o'clock there on Sunday morning, and we can't solve it until our time on Sunday and their time on Monday.
But we're trying to solve it.
Believe me, when the coverage changed, there were a lot of text messages flying around, not all of them friendly.
We were trying to fix it, and at first we thought it was a technical glitch.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that won't happen again.
We've cut six fights down to five, as we normally do, and I think we've given the audience more than we need.
This is an unfortunate situation".
Tom Daly admits to feeling "uncomfortable" about sex
Olympic diver Tom Daly says he grew up feeling inferior because of his sex - but this inspired Daly to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he went to high school that "everyone is not like me".
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Disc, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he spoke about gay rights, which gives "hope" to others.
He said that being a parent has diminished his interest in winning the Olympics.
The show's longtime regular, Kirsty Young, was on a leave of absence for several months due to illness.
Daly sat on the shipwreck of Laverne's first program, and said that she felt "less" than others while growing up because "the society didn't accept that boys and girls were liked equally".
He said: "The feeling of being inferior and different is the real thing that has given me the strength and the strength to succeed".
He said he wanted to prove he was "something" and so he wasn't disappointed when everyone finally found out about his sexuality.
A two-time Olympic bronze medalist, Daly has now become a major LGBT campaigner, using his presence at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to urge more countries to legalize heterosexuality.
He said he was open because he felt lucky to live in public without any adverse consequences and wanted to give others "hope".
Three-time world champion Dalí said that she was "surprised" to fall in love with a man she met in 2013, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black.
Daly married an Oscar winner 20 years her senior, but he said the age gap was never an issue.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" - when Daly first competed in the Olympics at the age of 14, and Daly's father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to meet someone of the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs to his own.
In June, the couple became the parents of a son, Robert Ray Black-Dally, who Daly said changed his "entire outlook".
"If you had asked me last year, I would have said something related to 'I want to win a gold medal,'" he said.
"You know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
Following her diagnosis of brain cancer in 2011, at the age of 40, Daly gave her son the same name as her late father Robert.
His father never admitted that he was going to die and the last thing he asked was if the tickets for London 2012 were still left, because he wanted to see himself in the front row, Daly said.
"But I couldn't say 'No Daddy until I sit in the front row and watch,'" he said.
"I held his hand until he took his last breath, and it was only when his breath actually stopped and he died that I finally acknowledged that he was not invincible", he said.
The following year, Dali competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to bow down to a mother country in front of a crowd at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling", he said.
It also inspired him to choose his first song - Pride by Heather Sman, which resonated with him until the Olympics, and he still gets excited when he hears the song.
Desert Island Discs is on Sunday at 11:15 BST on BBC Radio 4.
Mickelson, who wasn't in top form on Saturday, didn't get off.
Phil Mickelson of the United States will make history on Sunday in his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he'll need to get his form up to make sure it's not an unpleasant milestone.
Mickelson, who is playing in his 12th historic appearance at the biennial event, was released by captain Jim Furyk on Saturday in the Forbo and Foursomes.
Instead of playing the game as he usually did for the Americans, the five-time major winner spent his days training in the ring, encouraging others and hoping to solve problems that he himself had.
Even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old, who was not accurate with the ball, was not a man for the rugged Le Mans National Golf Course, where the grass-covered course would punish mistakes.
Although the golf course is not as tough as it was, Mickelson is facing the accurate British Open champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth match on Sunday, who has teamed up with rookie star Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their events this week.
If the four-point underdogs get off to a strong start in the 12 singles matches, Mickelson's play will certainly be decisive.
Furik expressed confidence in his player, not saying he could say anything else.
"He fully understood what role he would have to play today, and he knocked me out and told me that he would be ready tomorrow", Furik said.
He's got a lot of confidence.
He's a great guy, and he's contributed a lot to these teams last week and this week.
I probably didn't imagine he'd play two games.
I imagined more, but that's what happened, and that's what we thought.
He wants to get on the field, like everyone else.
On Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played.
A Ryder Cup career that doesn't quite match the heights of his personal record would be over.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but his presence has brought a lot to the team that cannot be denied, Furyk said.
"He is funny, he is fiercely sarcastic, he is funny, he likes to make people laugh, and he is a great person to be on the team", Furik explained.
I think it was fun for the young players to play against him this week.
He's going to provide more than just play.
Captain Thomas John knows the big lead will soon be gone.
European captain Thomas John knows from experience that the unbroken lead in the singles on the final day of the Ryder Cup will be crushed.
Dane made his debut in a 1997 match at Valderrama, where the team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans but they came to the finish line by a very slight margin, with a lead of 141⁄2-131⁄2 to win.
"You're reminding yourself that there's a big lead at Valderama; we had a big lead at Brook Line, where we lost, and we won at Valderama, and it was just a win", John said, commenting on the class session of 2018 when John's team won 5-3 at Le Golf International on Sunday and 10-6 yesterday.
So history has shown me and the rest of my team that this is not over.
You might be bored tomorrow.
Get out of that situation quickly, do everything right.
Nothing ends until you get points on the board.
We have one goal, and that is to try and win this trophy, and that's all we're focused on.
I always say that I'm focused on my 12 players on the team, but we know who's on the other side - they're the best players in the world".
John, delighted by his team's performance on the rugged golf course, added: "I could never get ahead of myself on this.
Tomorrow is a different animal.
It's a different kind of personal demonstration that's coming tomorrow.
It's a pleasure to be on the course with a partner when things are great, but if you're on the course alone, your ability as a golfer will be fully tested.
That's the message you're supposed to send to the players, which is to bring out the best in you tomorrow.
Now, you're leaving your partner, and he's got to go out and get the best out of himself".
Unlike John, the opposite attitude is shown by opponent Jim Furyk, who asks the players to perform individually rather than as partners, with the only exceptions being Jordan Speith and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Fury had seen both ends of the great sporting event at the final day at Angel Maric, and was part of the winning team at Brookline, where Fury had lost to Europe's "Miracle at Medina".
On the final day, when Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, was asked how he had lined up his players, he said, "I remember every detail of it".
"We have 12 major matches tomorrow, but you want to get a quick start like you saw at Brookline, like you saw at Medina.
When the speed goes the other way, there can be a lot of pressure in the midfield.
We've set the lineup accordingly, we've set the style of the players exactly the way we feel, you know, we're trying to pull out some magic tomorrow".
Thomas has been given the task of leading the attack, and in the top match he will face Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Ross, John Raham, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Pulter being the other Europeans coming in the first half of the order.
"I went with this group in this order because I think it's inclusive in every way", John said of his singles choices.
The commissioning of the new German battleship has been postponed again.
The German Navy's newest warship, intended to replace older and Cold War-era warships, was due to be commissioned in 2014, but local media report that it will not be commissioned until at least next year due to faulty systems and snowballing costs.
The military spokesman was quoted as saying that the commissioning of Rhineland-Palatinate, the flagship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class battleship, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, the Die Zeit newspaper reported.
The Navy was supposed to receive the ship in 2014, but the fate of the Pride project was adversely affected by problems encountered prior to delivery.
To replace the aging Bremen-class battleships, the Navy ordered four Baden-Württemberg-class ships in 2007.
The ships are known to have high-powered artillery, anti-aircraft, anti-ship missiles, and some classified technologies such as radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Another important feature is that long-term maintenance is not required, so it is possible to deploy new warships away from the home ports, for up to two years.
However, Die Seite suggests that the continuous delays to commissioning means that these advanced-technology warships will be obsolete by the time they enter service; the ships are said to be those that allow Germany to show its might in foreign countries.
The ill-fated F125s made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ships and sent them back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
The first time in the history of the Navy that a ship was taken off the ship and returned to the shipbuilder.
No one knows anything about the reasons behind the ship's return, but German media reports that the ship has several critical "software and hardware defects" and therefore would be of no use to the warship if deployed for combat missions.
Software inadequacies are particularly important as the new Baden-Württemberg class battleships will be operated by a crew of 120 men, just half the size of the old Bremen-class battleships.
Further, there has been a report that the ship is overweight and overweight will reduce the performance of the ship and limit the ability of the Navy to innovate in the future.
The 7,000-tonne "Rhineland-Fals" is believed to have been twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the German Car during World War II.
Even if the faulty hardware is replaced, the cost of the entire project - including the training of the crew - becomes an issue.
The initial estimated cost of €2.2 billion is said to have reached €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
In light of recent warnings that Germany's naval strength is declining, issues affecting the latest warships are particularly relevant.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the navy was actually "deploying ships that are depleted".
The problems are complicated by the decommissioning of old ships and the failure of the Parak to get new ships, officials said.
He expressed regret that none of the new Baden-Württemberg class warships have been of use to the Navy.
The National Trust is monitoring the secret life of the whales
A new study is being conducted at a Scottish hill estate to understand how the whales use the landscape to hunt for food.
The findings are expected to provide new insights into the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
At Inverareve Gardens in West Rose, scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will observe the study of common, soprano pipistrelles and brown long-eared dowbenton whales.
Special recorders will be installed at key locations around the estate to track the activities of the whales throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
The sound analysis of all recordings will help to determine the frequency of the waves and to determine which species of waves are making the sound.
A habitat map and report will then be prepared to create a detailed landscape-wide picture of the behavior of the whales.
Rob Dever, a conservation consultant at NTS, hopes the results of the survey will reveal which areas of the ecosystem are most important to the whales and how each of the whales' species uses them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of ecosystem conservation activities such as grassland creation and best management of rainforests for whales and other related species.
Over the last century, the number of whales across Scotland and the UK has declined dramatically.
The whales are threatened by buildings, development and habitat destruction that affect their breeding grounds.
Wind turbines, electric light, fly papers, chemical treatments of construction materials, and attacks from pet cats are threats to the bats.
Baillie are not really blind.
However, because of their nocturnal habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes in catching prey.
They use a highly sophisticated eco-location technique to accurately identify insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS is taking the Bavals very seriously, who are in charge of the maintenance of over 270 historically significant buildings, 38 major parks and 76,000 hectares of land across the country.
The institute has ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, conduct mass tests, and sometimes save animals.
The organisation has opened Scotland's first and only dedicated whale sanctuary at the Treva Estate in Dumfries, and the sanctuary, called Galloway, is home to eight of the whale species found in Scotland.
The estate manager, David Thompson, says the estate is a model area for the whales.
"There is plenty of space for the bats here in Trive", he said.
"There are old buildings, lots of big trees and good ecosystems.
But there's still a lot that we don't know about the whales, so what we're doing here and at other estates will help us understand more about what it takes for the whales to thrive".
He emphasizes the importance of inspecting the whales before performing maintenance inside buildings, because accidentally destroying a mother herd could kill 400 females and cubs, and sometimes even wipe out entire whales in the area.
Here we protect the whales, and it's illegal to kill them, harm them, harass them or destroy their nests.
Elizabeth Farrell, a Scottish official with the Bat Conservation Trust, has appealed to the public for help.
They said: "We still have so much to learn about our whales, how many species there are, and how well they multiply".
Ronaldo denies the abuse story published by German magazine, lawyers seek compensation from the magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the story of the abuse against him "fake news", saying that people were "making a name for themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to take the case to court against the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
In 2009, Ronaldo, who played as a forward for Portugal and Juventus, allegedly raped an American girl, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room.
Ronaldo allegedly paid the woman $375,000 to keep the affair quiet, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking to his 142 million followers in an Instagram live video within hours of the allegation being reported, the 33-year-old Ronaldo denounced the reports as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no. I was just like,
"They told us it was fake news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said in a live stream.
"They want to be famous for my name.
It's only natural.
They want to make a name for themselves by saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm happy, I'm fine, with a smile added.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to file a defamation suit against Der Spiegel over the allegations, which according to Reuters were an unauthorized reporting on privacy concerns.
The star's lawyer Christian Shirtz said he would seek compensation for "moral damages as serious as the violation", adding that "it is one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent times".
The alleged incident allegedly took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the star's room after meeting at a nightclub, where Mayorga was interviewed by Ronaldo.
After the alleged incident, Mayorca claims that Ronaldo knelt before him and told him that he was "99 percent" a "good man" but that "one percent" had cheated.
Ronaldo confirmed that the two had had sexual relations, but the documents claim it was by mutual consent.
Mayorka claims that she went to the police and took pictures of the injury in a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "that retaliatory measures would be intimidating" and was concerned about "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old said that she had taken legal action by cancelling the settlement, which was still in dispute.
Ronaldo was preparing to leave Manchester United for Real Madrid at the time of the alleged attack, and had joined Italian giants Juventus for a fee of $100 million this summer.
Brexit: UK 'will forever regret' the loss of its carmakers
Business Secretary Greg Clark said that the UK would "regret it forever" if it lost its position as the world's number one car maker after Brexit.
He added that he was "concerned" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that it would suspend production at its Barnaston plant near Derby if Britain left the EU without a deal.
"We need a deal", Clark said.
If a no-deal Brexit is to take place, the Japanese carmaker said jobs would be lost due to the impact of delays at the borders.
The Burnston plant, which manufactures Toyota's Oris and Aventis, produced 1,50,000 cars last year, 90 percent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"If the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, I think we will stop production at our factory", said Marvin Cook, managing director of Toyota's Burnston plant.
In the wake of Britain's exit from the European Union without a deal, other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have raised concerns about how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW says that the mini plant in Oxford will be closed for a month following Brexit.
In the event of a no-deal Brexit, the main concerns expressed by car manufacturers are related to supply chain risks.
Toyota's production line is based on the time of arrival of components, with parts arriving to Toyota from suppliers in the UK and EU every 37 minutes.
On March 29, if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, there could be a blockage at the border, which could lead to delays and shortages of components, the industry says.
The company said it was impossible to store more inventory than it could for a day at Toyota's Derbyshire plant, so production would have to stop.
Theresa May's Checkers Plan for the future relationship with the EU, said Clark, was "fully planned to avoid such checks at the border".
"We need an understanding, not only to enjoy the current success, but to have a better understanding that allows us to take advantage of this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The evidence from Toyota and other manufacturers reminds us that we have a highly successful supply chain and we definitely need to be able to keep it that way".
While Toyota did not say how long it would halt production, the company warned that in the long run, the extra costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and result in job losses.
Peter Suvallaris, a unit union convener at the plant who has worked at Barnston for 24 years, said his members were concerned about the increased level of unemployment: "In my experience, once these jobs are gone, they will never come back".
A government spokesperson said: "We have put forward a clear and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union.
The White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein will be delayed again.
The White House said Sunday that the ongoing fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh will delay Donald Trump's crucial meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein by a week.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, the Special Counsel investigating Russian election interference, ties between Trump's aides and Russia, and the president's obstruction of justice.
Whether or not Trump will remove the deputy attorney general and thereby undermine Mueller's independence has fueled Washington rumors for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Despite the news that he was about to retire, he went to the White House last Monday.
Instead, he announced a meeting with Trump at the United Nations in New York on Thursday.
Trump said he was "not interested" in dismissing Rosenstein, but delayed the meeting to avoid it during the Senate Judiciary Committee trial, which saw Kavanaugh and one of the women who alleged he had sexually abused her, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into Kavanaugh, again delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "No date has been set, it's likely this week, and I think it could be postponed by another week given everything else at the Supreme Court.
Let's see, I'm always interested in giving the media new information anyway".
Sanders hasn't held a White House press conference since Sept. 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked who the cause was.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to "crowd-out" by TV reporters, although she stated: "I don't disagree with the fact that they are coming in crowds".
She suggested that there would be more direct contact between the media and Trump after that.
"The president is handling more Q&A sessions than any of his predecessors", he said. And he added, without proof, "We've looked at the numbers".
There will be more press conferences, and Sanders said, "If the media gets a chance to ask the president of the United States questions directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We've tried to do that many times, and you've seen us do it many times over the last few weeks, and now instead of holding a press conference, you're going to be talking directly to the president of the United States".
Trump regularly answers questions during press conferences with dignitaries or during open sessions when he leaves the White House.
It's rare to hold press conferences by yourself.
This week in New York, we demonstrated why it appeared freely but strangely in front of a gathering of reporters.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Health Secretary wrote to thank EU workers working in the NHS in Scotland and express the country's wish that they remain after Brexit.
Less than six months before Britain leaves the European Union, Sean Freeman, MSP, sent a letter.
The Scottish Government has already offered to cover the cost of the residence status applications for EU citizens working in the field of devolved public services.
In the letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "As the summer approaches, compromise talks on withdrawal between the UK and the EU are ongoing, with expected decisions likely to be taken this autumn.
But Britain has already begun preparations for a no-deal scenario.
I know this is a time of uncertainty for all of you.
That's why I want to emphasize how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
The valuable experience and skills demonstrated by colleagues from across the EU and beyond have played a major role in strengthening and improving healthcare operations, thereby benefiting patients and society.
Scotland is your home. We want you to stay".
Christian Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery following a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery for a head injury following a loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, May 31-27, the Tennesseean's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters he was injured just before halftime.
"He got on the sideline and got stuck", Reed said.
On the sidelines, trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen and placed him in a tracher, then took him away for further examination.
An official from the state of Tennessee informed Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie's surgery was completed from Vanderbilt Medical Center.
"There is no information available on the severity/type of injury" and the state of Tennessee is trying to determine when the accident occurred, he said.
It was the first season at Tennessee State since redshirt sophomore Abercrombie moved from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles before the end of Saturday's game, and this season, he had a total of 18 tackles.
Foreigners will have to pay high stamp duty when they come to Britain to buy property.
Foreigners will have to pay a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK, and the extra money will be used to help the homeless under Tory plans.
This move will neutralize Corb's move to attract young voters.
In the UK, those who don't pay taxes will be charged more stamp duty.
The Treasury expects this to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreigners will have to pay higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK - and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The move is an attempt to block Jeremy Corb's efforts to attract young voters by providing more affordable housing and targeting the higher income group.
The stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the extra money will support the government's move to provide housing to the homeless.
Surcharge - In addition to the current stamp duty, imposed on second homes and rental houses two years ago - can be up to 3%.
The Treasury aims to raise up to £120 million a year.
13% of newly built London properties are bought by outsiders, which drives up prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to break into the housing sector.
Many affluent areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" because a good percentage of foreign buyers spend more time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in stamp duty to help more young people own their first home.
He accused property prices of rising because large construction firms own land but do not use it, and urged Mrs May to drop quotas on affordable housing to address Britain's "housing scandal".
Mr Corbyn announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to the eviction of "no-nonsense".
He also wants to give more power to the councils to build new houses.
Mrs May said: Last year I said that I would dedicate my Prime Ministership to restoring the British dream, that is, to making life better for every new generation.
It means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not true that non-British residents and foreign companies can afford to buy homes as easily as hard-working British residents.
The dream of many people having their own home is far from reality, and the shame of not having a place to sleep is still a reality".
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate wish is to rule Scotland.'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate ambition" is to take control of Scotland at some point.
The challenge for the 42-year-old, who is currently third in League One, is to revive the North-East club.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"As a player, my ambition is to play for my country.
I got a B cap, that's all", Ross told BBC Scotland's SportsSound.
But growing up with my dad in Hampden, Scotland, as a kid, it was something that always held me back.
But I'll only get that chance if I manage the club".
Ross' predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo de Cano.
The former Aloha Atleti boss said he had no hesitation in succeeding established names at such big clubs, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, success will be measured by the question 'Can I bring this club back to the Premier League now?'
The structure and facilities of this club undoubtedly place it in the Premier League", he said.
"It's not easy to get it there, but I'll see that I've won here if I can get this club back there".
Ross has spent just three years of his managerial career as an assistant boss at Dumbarton and 15 months on the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa to clinch promotion from the relegation play-offs to the third tier, and saved St Mirren from relegation to the Championship title winners the following season.
Rose says he is happier now than he was in his sports career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"That may have been the real turning point", he says, taking over from Lova.
"I honestly believed that management was more suited to me than playing.
Strange as it may seem, I've made a living off of it, and I've been able to climb a few heights.
But playing can be difficult.
There's a lot to go through every week.
I still have work issues and pressures, but I feel great about management.
I always wanted to be a manager, and now I am. I am happy to do what I love at my good age".

The pressure on restaurant chains has increased as the extreme summer heat has spurred loss-making pubs in the UK.
The figures suggest that the sales in July rose by 2.7 per cent in pub bar groups, while in restaurants it was down by 4.8 per cent.
The figures were compiled by Peter Martin, CGA of Business Consultancy, who said: "The continued summer and the expected prolonged England participation in the World Cup have been a trend in June in pubs in July.
The restaurant sector has seen a further decline in July, down from the 1.8 per cent drop in June.
When the drink-led pubs and bars were stronger than they had been in years, the restaurants were going down.
Food-led pubs have also been struggling with the summer heat, but this one wasn't as much as the restaurants.
People think they're all going out for a drink.
In most bars and pubs, the sale of drinks increased by 6.6 percent in the month, while food decreased by 3 percent".
"These results from the end of April are still coming", says Paul Neumann, analyst at Lisher and Hospitallity, RSM.
The major factors influencing sales in markets are weather and social sporting events.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups are concerned, but the 4.8% year-on-year decline in sales is in addition to the continued price pressure.
Food-led operators are the most affected by the prolonged summer, and we must wait and see if the comparatively mild weather in August will provide temporary relief".
The overall growth of 2.7 per cent in July, which was driven by new openings in the pub and restaurant sectors, actually indicates a slowdown in brand roll-outs.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, a sales tracker for pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK, collects and reviews the performance data of 47 working groups with a turnover of £9 billion. It is a benchmark in the field.
One in five children has a social media account that they keep hidden from their parents.
One study reveals that one in five children - even those aged 11 and over - may have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students found an increase in "fake Insta" pages
This news has raised concerns that sexual content is being posted.
About 20 percent of the children said they had a "main" account to show their parents.
One in five children - even those as young as 11 - have social media accounts and keep them hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students found an increase in "fake Insta" accounts - a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
This news has raised concerns that sexual content is being posted.
About 20 percent of students say they have a clean "main" account and secret personal accounts to show their parents.
A mother who had access to the secret website of her teenage daughter, who was only 13 years old, was shocked to see a teenager calling on others to "rape yourself".
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of Independent Schools found that 40% of children aged 11-18 had two profiles, half of which kept secret accounts.
HMC Chief Mike Bucknan said: "It is an unfortunate fact that teenagers are trying to create online spaces that parents and teachers cannot find".
Scottish it's on the latex board "it'll be the sound of the lads" by Elyd Doyle
Elid Doyle was elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics as a Non-Executive Director at the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Council.
Chairman Ian Beatty said: "This is a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from the vast experience gained internationally over the past decade.
"Elid is highly respected in the Scottish, UK and world athletics community and we believe bringing him on board will greatly benefit athletics in Scotland", Beatty added.
Doyle said: "I am very excited to be the voice for the athletes and I believe I can make my own contribution and help to lead Scotland's sport".
The American, who won four Olympic golds, including the 200m and 400m races at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, and is now a regular BBC pundit, has lost his mobility following a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "A month ago on this day I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time could tell how much he would recover from this.
It was a very difficult time, but I'm all right, I've learned to walk again, and I can now exercise with enthusiasm!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
An online advert comparing mothers to cows sparked controversy
An advertisement comparing nursing mothers to dairy cows has sparked a variety of online comments.
To launch a product titled "The World's First Wearable Noise-Free Breast Pump", consumer tech company LV has advertised a fun music video showing the facility that the new pump provides mothers.
It shows four moms dancing to this music in a cow-washing area. The lyrics are: "Yes, I'm milking, but you can't see the tail". And "If you're not paying attention, I'll tell you, it's not the nipples, it's my tits".
And the chorus says, "Pump, pump, I'm giving it to the kids".
However, the ad posted on the company's Facebook page sparked controversy online.
The video, which has received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, has been met with mixed reactions from fans, many of whom have been critical of the dairy industry's "inside outs".
"It was a bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
They carry their babies in the womb and produce milk, just like us, except that they take their babies away from them within days of birth", one observer noted.
The LV Breast Pump (LV/ 'Mother') can be fitted very well inside a nursing bra
Another commented: "To understand that it is equally difficult for mother and child
But why not use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who can breastfeed their babies?"
Another added: "Ruthless advertising".
Others were in favor of the ad, with one woman saying the song was "fun".
"I think this is a good idea.
If I had been breastfeeding, I would have.
I felt like a cow when I was pumping.
This ad is a little bit off, but I'm gonna take it as it is.
This is a good product", one commented.
Another commented: "It's a funny ad targeting mothers (sometimes in the workplace and in the toilet) who look like "pumping cows".
It's not praising or criticizing the dairy industry".
The dancing women at the end of the video reveal that they all had pumps inside their bra.
The idea behind this campaign is that women who pump their breasts look like cows.
However, the LV pump is certainly convenient, with no wires or tubes and will fit snugly inside the nursing brake, giving women the freedom to walk, pick up children and go outside while pumping.
Anna Ballarin, the mother's partner and ECD, says: "The LV pump is a revolutionary product, and it takes a bold, rousing start.
We have tried to bring to light the disadvantages of breast pumping by comparing nursing mothers and cows, and to show the freedom of the new pump in a very interesting and relatable way.
This isn't the first time LV Pump has been in the news.
At London Fashion Week, the model, mother of two, used this product to catwalk designer Martha Jacobowski.
Hundreds of immigrant children were moved to tent camps on the Texas border.
While the number of children crossing the border each month remains unchanged, there has been a huge increase in the number of unauthorized immigrant children because some of the Trump administration's harsh policies make it difficult to acquire children through sponsors.
Many traditional sponsors become undocumented immigrants, and risk their own situation if they step forward to take responsibility for a child.
The risk was increased in June by a policy calling on federal authorities, sponsors and adult members of their household to submit their fingerprints and share that information with the Immigration Authority.
Matthew Albers, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, explained to Congress that a dozen people had been arrested for sponsoring undocumented miners in the past week.
The agency confirmed that about 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"About 80 per cent of the sponsors or their families are illegal immigrants in the country and a large part of them have a criminal background.
So we were just trying to get them to dig", Mr. Alburnes said.
To settle the children's case quickly, officials had introduced new rules that would require them to appear in court within a month of being detained.
Instead of appearing in person to an immigration judge to ask for their legal status, more people are making conference calls.
Those who are not eligible will be immediately deported.
Over the next few months, as shelter workers comment and report, children who are held in detention for longer periods become anxious and depressed, which can lead to poor outcomes and attempts to escape.
Such concerns are heightened by the fact that children in difficult conditions in such large facilities as those in Torino are more likely to be neglected.
They said that moving children to tent cities without giving them the time to prepare mentally or even to say goodbye to their friends only exacerbated their feelings.
Syria calls for immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish troops
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Interior Minister Walid al-Ma'ulam called on Syrian refugees to return home as the country's war is entering its eighth year.
Molam, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were present on Syrian soil illegally in the name of countering terrorism and that they would "do as they wish".
"They must withdraw immediately without any conditions", he told the assembly.
The source stressed that the "war on terror" in Syria, which has killed more than 3,60,000 people and displaced millions since 2011, is almost over.
He said that this holy struggle will continue in Damascus until "illegal foreigners" and terrorist groups are "eradicated from all Syrian territory".
There are approximately 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria providing training and advice to Syrian Arabs and the Kurdish army, which opposes President Bashar al-Assad.
There are over 1,000 French troops in this war-torn country.
In terms of refugees, Maullam said it was time for them to return, accusing "some Western countries" of "spreading unrealistic fears" and keeping refugees away.
"We have appealed to the international community and human rights organizations to facilitate their return", he said.
"They are politicizing a matter of absolute human rights".
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide aid for the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold, has opened the way for further political talks, UN diplomats said.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has averted a major offensive by the Russian-backed Syrian army in an area of three million people.
Maulum stressed that the agreement has a precise "timeline" and expressed hope that the military attack will target the fighters, including jihadists from Nusra Front who are linked to Al-Qaeda, and "will wipe them out".
UN Ambassador Stefan de Mistura said he hoped to convene the first meeting of a new committee composed of members of the ruling party and opposition to pave the way for the drafting of a post-war Syrian constitution and elections.
The basic terms for the Government's participation in the Committee were put forward. He said that the function of the Panel should be to "review the provisions of the existing Constitution".
Why Trump could win a second term
According to that logic, Trump could win the 2020 election if impeachment corruption and his rule are not ended, as many liberal-minded people expect.
Then it would be the most dramatic final bid for the presidency.
There is no shortage of spectators so far.
Since 2014, prime time ratings have more than doubled at CNN to 10.5 and at MSNBC to 16.
Nielsen noted that prime-time viewership has risen from 1.7 million viewers four years ago to an average of 2.4 million, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" is leading cable ratings with nearly 35 million viewers.

Hard-fought midterm House races are infused with outside money.
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th has a cash flow that's due to the realignment of congressional districts that brought two officers into the same race for office.
The most recent boundary changes stop the Pittsburgh Democrat, Conor Lamb, who won a special election in another district last spring.
Lamp is running against fellow incumbent Republican Rep. Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania's 12th district, which has now been overlaid into the 17th district.
The boundaries were redrawn in January by the Supreme Court ruling that the old districts were unconstitutionally misrepresented in favor of the Republican Party.
The New 17 contest marked the beginning of a financial feud between the big finance parties, The Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
After winning the widely viewed March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District by a small margin, Lamp became a household name in Pennsylvania.
The seat was held by the Republican Party for over a decade, with President Donald Trump winning by 20 points from that district.
Political pundits have given the Democrats a slight chance of victory.
The United States considered and later withdrew from sanctioning El Salvador for its support of China.
Diplomats said the Dominican Republic and Panama had backed Beijing without causing significant dissatisfaction from Washington.

State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. diplomatic chiefs from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama following recent decisions that Taiwan will no longer recognize Taiwan, Department spokeswoman Heather Norbert said in a statement earlier this month.
But the fines were only considered against El Salvador, which received $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control, development and financial aid.
The proposed penalties, including cuts to benefits and visa restrictions, are expected to weigh on Central American countries, leading to increased unemployment and murder rates.
While domestic meetings are underway, North American and Central American officials have postponed the planned high-level meeting to review the progress of last year's high-level discussions on security and economic prosperity, which they hope will be a step toward efforts to contain immigration.
High-level officials are calling for the conference to be moved forward by mid-September, which will also help consider the penalties on El Salvador.
The Deputy Prime Minister Mike Pence, who was in charge of convening the conference, has postponed it to mid-October to include senior officials from the administration, the diplomats said.
Three U.S. diplomats have also returned from Washington without any new messages or sanctions, including to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic.
Bolton, a White House spokesman, declined to comment on a discussion that was opened by three US officials, including diplomats, who were supposed to discuss the uncertainty in the domestic situation in the United States.
An outside analyst who is very close to the administration confirmed their arguments and spoke of the uncertainties.
The history of the study
The next major event is the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, which may be a special piece of evidence in public records regarding Trump's unfairness.
Mueller is reportedly expanding his investigation into whether the Trump campaign has been complicit in violence in our election.
If Trump and a jury of his peers at that meeting were to take responsibility as they were about to go before the voters again, is it possible that Congress would not take responsibility?

Ranger Graham Torrance expressed optimism in the clash with Rapid Wien.
A win over the Austrians earlier this month, followed by a thrilling match against Villarreal in Spain, puts them in the strongest position to qualify for Europa League Group G, where they will face Rangers Rapid Vienna on Thursday.
Midfielder Graham Torrance has been ruled out of his debut with a knee injury, with the season 2-2 at Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can work miracles on the springboard with the result.
"We are happy that Villarreal is in good shape", said the 31-year-old.
"We go out and we come back with points, believing we can do something.
This may be the last time we'll ever look closely at this, but it will have a positive effect.
They may have played well in the first half, but we came back better in the second.
Thursday is a big European night.
We can hope to get three points, but it's a difficult game because they have good results from the previous games, but I believe that with the support of our people we can do it and we can achieve a positive result.
Last year was difficult because of my injuries and the changes at the club, but now I'm relieved.

I hope that we can leave last season behind and move forward and succeed".
Women lose sleep over the fear of saving for retirement.
While many of those surveyed had different views on how they should be protected, very few had to speak to their family members about it.
The study found that half of the respondents in the country talk to their partner about the money they need for long-term care.
Only 10% of them talk to their kids about it.
"Everyone needs a family member to protect them", says Holly Sinder, vice president of the International Life Insurance Business, "but many are not prepared to take the steps to even talk about it".
This is where we start.

The earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in the massive earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palau on Friday, officials said, with the death toll likely to rise.
Relief officials said no information was received as all communications were disrupted in Dongla Regency in northern Palu, very close to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
More than 16,000 people were displaced in Palouse as a result of the earthquake.
Here are some facts about the provinces of Palu and Dongla in the Republic of Sulawesi
The capital of Central Sulawesi, Palu is a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island. The population was estimated at 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Tongkala Regency is located on the northwest coast of Sulawesi Island, extending 300 km (180 mi).
The regency is a sub-provincial administrative region with a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main components of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, especially the coastal area of Tonggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province but it is more concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Silvas.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, the areas of Palu and Tonggala have experienced several tsunamis in the past 100 years.
The 1938 tsunami in Tonggala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
The 1996 tsunami that struck the western province of Tonggala killed nine people.
Geographically located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, Indonesia is prone to earthquakes.
Here are some of the most significant earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent times.
2004: A major earthquake in the Indonesian province of Iqui, North Sumatra, on December 26 affected 14 countries along the Indian Ocean coast, killing 226,000 people, more than half of whom were in Iqui.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes occurred in late March and early April along the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on Nyas Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006 An earthquake in Indonesia's most populous island, Java, in 2006 at 6.8 magnitude caused a tsunami that devastated the entire southern coast and killed about 700 people.
The 2009 7.6 magnitude earthquake was felt in the city of Patang, the capital of North Sumatra Province.
About 1,100 people died.
In Sumatra, a 2010 7.5 magnitude earthquake in the Mentawai Islands caused tsunami waves as high as 10 meters, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
A minor earthquake in 2016 in the PD Regency of Ike Province caused extensive damage, and was a reference to the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
But this time it wasn't the tsunami, it was me, and 100 people died under the collapsed buildings.
The 2018 Indonesian earthquake on the tourist island of Lombok killed more than 500 people, mostly from the north of the island.
The quake caused thousands of buildings to collapse and thousands of tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palinte's eldest son is arrested for domestic violence
The eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin has been arrested on domestic abuse charges.
The Alaska State Troopers reported in a report on Saturday that Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for domestic violence, interfering in domestic violence reporting, and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, he had also taken the phone from the woman who tried to report the alleged crimes to the police.
According to KTUU's report, the $500 unsecured bond was recalled from the other-su patriotic facility.
When he was presented in court on Saturday and asked to apologize, news networks reported that he replied that he was "absolutely not guilty".
Pall faces three counts of Class A misdemeanor, which carries a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was charged with a Class B misdemeanor, for which he was sentenced to one day in jail and fined $2,000.
This isn't the first time Pal has been charged with criminal offenses.
He was arrested by the police in December 2017 for assaulting his father, Todd Pall.
This incident was reported to the police by his mother, Sarah Palin.
The case is pending in the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with the report of a domestic violence offence, and possession of a weapon in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend also complained that he was beaten in the face.
In 2016, the Veterans Group criticized Sarah Pall for her son's misconduct that had hindered his service with PSTD.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: hundreds killed
384 people were killed in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude quake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The death rate is likely to increase in the coming days due to the failure of power and communication networks.
The quake was felt in Central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos of the impact of the incident have gone viral on social media.
As the tsunami approached the coast, hundreds of people gathered on the shore for the city's beach festival.
Federal prosecutors have called for a rare death sentence for the suspect in the NYC terror attack.
New York City lawyers are calling for the death penalty for Cyfullo Saipov, the NYC terrorist attack that killed eight people, the rarest execution in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Zypov used a home depot rental truck to attack a bike path on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, causing the deaths of pedestrians and cyclists on the road.
According to the Southern District of New York's notice of cause of death, to justify the death sentence, lawyers would need to prove that Mr. Saipov had "intentionally" killed all eight and had inflicted "consciously" serious physical injury.
Both charges are punishable by death under the statute.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Sipov on 22 counts, including 8 counts of murder in aid of robbery, which federal attorneys use for common organized crime, and assault and destruction of a motor vehicle.
The lawyers said the manner in which the crime was committed was "cruel, cruel and despicable" and that such an attack required "substantial planning and planning".
"Saffulo Habibullavich has caused injury and damage to the family and friends of Saipov Diego N. Rick Angelini, Nicholas Cleaves, Anne-Laure Decade, Darren Drake, Ariel Erliz, Her Nan Ferrucci, Her Nan Diego Mendoza and Alajan Drao Damian Pugnuco", the notice of the state of the deceased said.
The five people involved in the accident were Argentine.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York sentenced a man to death.
Khalid Barnes, who was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, was sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last execution in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a federal couple convicted of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, the Uzbek national, Saipov, has not expressed any remorse in the days and months since the attack.
Police said he told investigators that he was only happy with his work.
Saipov told authorities that the attack was inspired by ISIS videos he saw on his phone.
Police said he had asked to fly the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He has pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
Federal defendant attorney David Patton, who appeared for Saipov, said he was "naturally disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to impose the death penalty without any possibility of release from prison will increase the mental impact of all those involved", Pathan said.
Saipov's opponent had already requested that the lawyers not seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Faraj should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to "nail the People's Army" at the Tory conference protest.
The former UKIP leader suggested that politicians should "get hot" from Eurosceptics - one of Theresa May's own MPs had suggested she be put in charge of consultations with Europe.
If Farage had been Brexit secretary, the UK would have 'gone out' by now, said Peter Bon, the de facto backbencher, in Birmingham in March.
May's challenges in reconciling her divided ranks were underlined by the Tories, who lined up in the city for a special protest against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is struggling to protect his Chequers compromise plan from the attacks of the Brexiteers, the Remainers and the EU.
The allies argued that they would go ahead with a deal with Brussels regardless of the setbacks - and would force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between their promise and 'difficulties'.
At the Leave Me Leave rally in Solihull, Bone said he wanted to "get the checkers out".
He suggested that Mr. Farage be given equal responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd be out by now", he said.
Wellingborough MP added 'I support Brexit, but we need to get Chequers out'
He said, expressing his opposition to the EU, that we are not subject to world wars.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.'
Bonn has denied claims that public opinion has changed since the 2016 election. The claim that the British public has changed their minds and wants to stay is completely false.
Tory Brexit campaigner Andrea Jenkins also attended the march, and she told reporters, "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers are not well known in the public, the opposition is not going to vote for them, and it is not popular with the activists who have overstepped our party and elected us in the first place.
Please stop checking out the checkers.
In her message to Miss Maine, she added: 'The Prime Minister can only keep his position as long as he keeps his promises.
If you are going to avoid the decision taken in the 2016 referendum, then you should make the politicians at the rally 'feel warm'.
'It is a matter of trust between us - the people - and our ruling class,' he said.
'They are trying to cheat Brexit but we are here today to tell them we will not let you do that.'
In his message to the excited crowd, he added: 'I want you to 'feel warm' our political class on the verge of betraying Brexit.
'We are mobilizing the People's Army of this country, which gave us the victory in Brexit, and we will never rest until we become an independent, sovereign and United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, the Remnants had marched to Birmingham before a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Since the group started over the weekend, the Tory activists have been waving a little bit of wisdom against the Brexit banners.
After the start of the conference, Lord Adonis of the Labour Party mocked the security issues facing the app from the Conservative Party.
These are the people who are telling us that the IT systems are right, that Canada Plus Plus has all the technology, frictionless borders, free markets without restrictions in Ireland, he added.
This is a complete joke.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren plans to watch the presidential election carefully
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would carefully analyze running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at a town hall in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
A staunch critic of President Donald Trump, Warren is running for reelection in November against GOP state representative Geoff DeHale, who was co-chairman of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
She is among the speculators who will take Trump's place in 2020.

Baton Rouge police said Saturday they have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wade Simms on Friday.
The arrest of 20-year-old Dayton Simpson was announced by the Baton Rouge Police Department at an 11 a.m. ET news conference.
They asked for help identifying the man in the footage and released video footage of the Friday night shooting.
Sims, 20, was shot dead outside the Southern University campus Friday morning.
"Wade Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head, which resulted in his death", police chief Murphy J. Paul told 247 Sports on Saturday.
Ward went to defend his friend, and Simpson was shooting.
Simpson, who was holding the gun, was questioned and admitted to being at the scene and that Wade shot Simpson.
Simpson was arrested and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department without incident.
The 6-foot-6-inch junior Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games, including 10 starts, last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton ended his World Championship after handing over the team order to beat Sebastian Houtman.
It was clear from that moment that Valtteri Bottas had qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton in the match on Saturday, where Mercedes' team orders played a big part.
Boots had a good start in the pole and defended his position in the first two laps, inviting home-field advantage to attack teammates, which made Hamilton worse.
The home went to Pitts first and allowed Hamilton to drive through the traffic in the wallet.
Mercedes had taken a lap earlier and was behind home, but Hamilton went ahead after the wheel-to-wheel action, and cut the Ferrari driver who had avoided the risk of holding impatiently after the double move to defend at the third corner.
Max Werstappen started from the back row of the grid and finished seventh at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
After a sudden finish, he was stuck on the tyres and held the lead for much of the race, then finished fourth behind Kimi Raikkonen.
He finished 44th on lap 44 at the pits and failed to accelerate on the remaining eight laps, so Rykon finished 4th.
It was a difficult day, because Voltaire did so well and was the gentleman who asked me to let him go.
"The team did the impossible job of resisting", Hamilton said.
That was definitely rude body language.
President Donald Trump mocked at a rally Saturday the argument of Senator Diane Feinstein that a letter written by Christy Blaisford alleging that she sexually assaulted Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was not leaked.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, he said that while the Senate Judiciary Committee had not heard anything about the letter the president had directly sent to Ford, what was happening in the Senate was revealing to people how "selfish, untrustworthy and bad-natured" people were.
"The beautiful things that are happening in the Senate right now are what are likely to happen when you see people who are angry, selfish, bad-natured and unfaithful", he said.
If the news gets out, they'll say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I did not".
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak?
And remember their answer -- did you leak the document -- "Oh, oh what?"
Oh, no, I know.
I didn't leak".
Oh, wait a minute.
"We've leaked... no, we haven't", he added, imitating the senator's expression.
The letter explaining the allegations made against Kavanaugh by Ford was sent by Feynstein in July and leaked in early September - but Feynstein denied that it was leaked from his office.
"I did not try to cover up Dr. Ford's allegations, and I did not release his story", Feynstein told a committee, The Hill reported.
They asked me to keep it a secret, so I did.
But the president was not comfortable with their protest, and he said at a rally on Saturday night, "I'll tell you, it was very bad body language".
Maybe they didn't, but they showed a body language that was like they'd never seen it".
The president said that while the Supreme Court nominee, accused of sexual assault by three women, is still being defended, the Democrats may be raising their own charges.
"They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
You can see their selfishness and bad behavior, and they don't care who they hurt or who they run after to get power and control", the president reportedly said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Doyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars have fought back from Friday's Elite League defeat to Belfast Stynes with a 5-3 win in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants had already taken a two-goal lead with strikes by Patrick Doyer and Francis Bellevoir.
Even before the Giants were restored to the lead, Mike Sullivan and John Crowney were bringing home the home side.
Francois Bouchard tied for the lead for Tandy before Lucas Lenduwald Nelson scored the winning goal.
It was Adam Kiffe's third Elite League defeat of the season from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting between the two sides, with the Giants winning the other three games.
At 3.35 in the fourth, Kendall McFaul opened the scoring with a goal from Dwyer, and four minutes later, David Rutherfurd doubled the lead with a goal from Belluver.
After a busy opening time, Sullivan had brought home the home team back to the game at 13-10 before Matt McWorthey's equalizer was delivered at 15:16.
Drawer, with his second goal of the night at the end of the first half, ensured the Giants' lead before taking the first break.
The home side group was reorganised and Bouchard once again put them in the level teams with a 27-37 power play goal.
Crowney and Charles Corcoran helped Neil Sun lead Dan Dicks to the lead at the end of the second period and secured his team's fifth-half victory in the final period.
After losing four of their last five games, the Giants arrived in Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller died trying to save a plane carrying 100 people
The Indonesian air traffic controller who died while preparing for the safe landing of a plane carrying hundreds of people became famous after his death.
The massive earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday killed more than 800 people and left many missing, which was also caused by the tsunami.
Strong aftershocks are affecting the area, with many people trapped in the city's rubble.
While many of his colleagues escaped with their lives, the agitated Mutiyahara Siss Al-Jufri, 21, quit his job at the control tower of the Pallu airport, refusing to flee.
He remained in his office to ensure the safe departure of Battic Air Flight 6321 which was on the runway at the time.
He then mistakenly thought the control tower was collapsing and jumped from it.
He later died in hospital.
His decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Indonesian air navigation spokesman Johannes Sirit said, according to ABC News of Australia.
We had a helicopter ready to take him from Balikpapan in Clementon to a big hospital in another city.
But we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palo.
"This is heartbreaking news", he added.
Meanwhile, the country's disaster mitigation agency said that due to the lack of access to Dongla, Siji and Baotung, officials fear the death toll could be in the thousands.
Agency spokesman Sutopo Parvo Nagrao said he believed the death toll could rise because many could not be reached and many bodies were under debris.
Waves of over 20 feet (6 meters) crushed many, leading to a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military industrial aircraft are delivering services and supplies.
"Bodies are being brought in every minute by ambulances", a 35-year-old mother named Reza Kusuma told Sky News.
Fresh water is very scarce
"Small markets are being looted everywhere".
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross has arrived at the scene to search for survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
It's a tragedy, but it could get worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo visited Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "You must complete all evacuation operations without day or night.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, earthquakes in Lombok, Indonesia, killed 550 people.
Air New Guinea now reports one person missing after the Micronesia lagoon plane crash
The airline, which operated the plane that crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, said one person was missing, and had earlier said that the 47-person crew had been safely evacuated from the crashed plane.
Air New Guinea said in a statement on Saturday afternoon that a male passenger could not be located.
The airline said it is working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing person.
The airline did not respond to requests for further information such as age and nationality of the missing person.
Local boats have been deployed to rescue passengers and crew aboard the plane that crashed into the water while attempting to land at the Chuck Island airport.
According to officials, seven people were hospitalized on Friday.
The airline said six people were in hospital on Saturday and all of them were in a state of emergency.
It is still unclear what caused the accident and how exactly it happened.
The airline and the US Navy said the plane landed before reaching the runway at the lagoon.
Some eyewitnesses said the plane seemed to be overtaking the runway.
American passenger Bill Gaines said the plane had come too low.
"That was a good thing", said Jains.
Jains said that he and his fellow passengers struggled to get to the emergency exit through the water that was halfway up the waist of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were scared and crying and he had a minor head injury.
Sailors working on a nearby pier helped bring the people ashore with a windbreaker, which helped the plane to save all people within about 30 meters (100 feet) of the water, the US Navy said.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG-registered aircraft over the past two decades, but none of these have involved Air New Guinea.
The timeline of the woman's burning alive at night is being released by analysts.
The prosecution reviewed the case of the defendant in the 2014 burning of a Mississippi woman alive.
As an expert witness in the field of investigative analysis, U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to piece together details of the exact night's movements of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tells and the 19-year-old deceased Jessica Chambers.
Contrary to his earlier claims, using location information collected from multiple cell phones, Clarion Ledger reported that he learned that Telles was with Chambers on the evening of the incident.
While the defendant claimed he was in the vicinity of his friend Michael Sanford, cell phone data indicates he was in the vicinity of Chambers, police spoke to Sanford.
But on Saturday, Sanford admitted that he wasn't in town that day.
When asked by his lawyer if Telles was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said, "That's a lie, because my truck was in Nashville".
Another discrepancy is that Telles said they had known each other for two weeks at the time of Chambers' death.
Cell phone records indicate they've only known each other a week.
After Chambers' death, Teles Chambers' messages, calls and contact information were removed from the phone, according to Roulet.
"He wiped her out of his life", Hale said.
The defendant's closing arguments are scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judge said that he hoped to be released for trial on the same day after the hearing.
The Hybrid: What is Conscious Hip Hop?"
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the art form by filling their music with positive messages.
The Bristol-based The Hybrid says hip-hop has moved away from the status quo, which emphasizes political messages and social issues.
They want to bring hip-hop back to its roots and re-populate conscious hip-hop.
Artists like Fugees and Common have recently been revived in the UK by contemporary artists like Lockey.
Another black woman?
A NY lawsuit was filed against the couple for their "anti-racist" message.
A New York couple has been sued for racial slurs after receiving a text from their mother claiming she was "another black woman".
The couple denied the racial accusation, saying the case was a form of robbery.
Lindsay Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed outrage at Giselle Maurice, who came to look after her child on her first day at work in 2016.
"No, it's another black woman", Lindsay Plasco-Flaxman said in a message from her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she switched sides and sent it to Maurice twice.
When Amalie realized that the "disgruntled" Place Co Flex Man, who had been their predecessor, was African American, that they had done a very poor job, and that he was referring to a Filipino, the New York Post reported, she let Maurice know.
Maurice was paid a day's wages and sent home in a Uber.
The Morris couple are now being sued for $350 a day in severance pay for six months, which is said to be the amount the mupp had promised them, but there are no contracts.
"I will make them understand that they should not do such things", she said in a post on Friday, adding, "I can understand that it is discrimination".
The couple denied the claim that they were racist, saying that after being spoken to in a hurtful way, they had no choice but to be fired from their jobs because they could not be trusted.
"My wife sent them a message that she didn't mean to say".
But they're not anti-racist.
"We're not anti-racist", her husband told the Post.
"But even if you were mistaken, would you be willing to hand your children over to the man you treated so harshly?
Your newborn baby?
Never will".
Describing the case as 'a slap in the face', Plasco said his wife had given birth to the baby just two months ago and that they were "in a very difficult situation".
"Would you follow such a man?
I don't think that's a good thing", he added, who is also an investment banker.
Although the case is still legally pending, the verdict quickly infamously denounced the couple on social media, denouncing their behavior and logic.
The new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that readers would disagree with the book Talking Bear.
In a letter, Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was accepted, wrote: "Before it is published, it is very difficult to put ourselves in the shoes of someone who is reading it for the first time.
It's interesting to know what we know now about Paddington's great success".
Inspired by a small butterfly, she said her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before writing the book, was confident even when the work was rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of his death was "bitter and sweet".
She described Paddington as "a very important member of the family", and added that her father was very proud of the achievement.
"He was perfectly calm, a man who didn't like to brag", they said.
Paddington was as real to him as you really are to a smart kid, and even if we didn't, we'd be proud of their accomplishments.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
If it was his creation and his imagination, he would give Paddington the credit.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
She and her daughter rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors were desperate to save her life.
"Nad would call to tell me that she was in such a bad condition, that she didn't expect to survive", said Mrs. Ednan-Laperos.
"Then I got a call from Nad, saying she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
I did just that.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby".
I'll be right with you.
I'll be with you.
The medication that doctors gave her to pump her heart was slowly being drained from her body, and she was leaving her body.
She died shortly before this was all over.
I had to wait there, watching all this.
I couldn't cry or scream, I was surrounded by my family and others.
I had a hard time keeping it together.
Grief-stricken over the loss of her daughter, Mrs. Ednan-Laperos, in the midst of her excruciating pain, boarded the plane with the other passengers.
"No one knew anything", they said.
"I lowered my head, tears pouring down my cheeks
It was hard to describe, but it was during the flight that I felt the sympathy for Ned.
He needed my love and care.
I knew how much he loved her".
Sad women drop postcards to prevent suicides from bridges.
Two women who lost their loved ones work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Postcards are being dropped on the Wilsh Bridge, including inspirational messages from Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys and phone numbers of people to call for help.
Davis' son, Taylor, suffered from depression from the age of 13, and committed suicide at 18.
She said, "I wish that none of my Lord's creatures would ever suffer the like of what I have suffered".
Davis, a 45-year-old woman in Lydney, recalls that her son grew up to be a chef and the owner of an attractive smile.
"He was known to all for his smile.
They always said his smile would light up a room".
He quit his job before he died because he was "in a completely dark place".
In 2014, Taylor's brother, who was only 11 at the time, found him dead by suicide.
Ms. Davis said: "I was always concerned about the outcome".
Ms. Davis made the cards to let people know that you have a lot of people around you, including friends, to come and talk to for help.
Don't be silent - you have to talk.
Ms. Davis' longtime friend, Ms. Humphreys, lost her partner, Mark, at the age of 15, shortly after the death of his mother.
"He never said he was sorry or depressed or anything", they said.
"We noticed a change in his temper in the days before Christmas.
When the kids took off their uniforms on Christmas Day, he didn't look them in the face or say anything to them.
They said that his death was a great tragedy for them, but they could have just lived with it. "It created a huge gap in the family.
We were all dragged away.
But we had to fight and keep going".

As the FBI investigates, Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance.
"I feel that if we had gotten what he wanted - a time-bound investigation, an investigation with limits - we would have brought about some unity", Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "getting into the biased fray".
Why don't Kavanaugh and his Republican aides want an FBI investigation?
Time is the cause of their discontent.
With only five weeks left before the November 6 midterm elections, if the Republicans don't win as expected, their bid to get their man on the nation's highest court will be weakened.
George W. Bush calls the senator and lobbies him to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House, and through him, Bush meets his wife, Ashley, who was his personal secretary.
What happens if I report to the FBI?
The Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will vote on the bill.
It's still unclear if Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which could allow Vice President Mike Pence to end the partnership and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
Under Kim, the number of defectors in North Korea is declining
South Korean lawmakers have said that since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, there has been a decline in the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea.
Park Byung-seog, citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, said that the number of migrants had increased from 2,076 in 2011 to 1,127 last year.
Park said the main reasons were the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the imposition of higher tariffs on smugglers.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Most of the North Korean immigrants have been granted South Korean citizenship in chronological order.
Seoul says that about 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Many crossed through China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats these migrants as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and often forcibly returns them to the country.
Relations between the North and the South - although still virtually at war - have improved dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two leaders met in Pyongyang for pending talks on denuclearization.
This comes after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, where they jointly agreed to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But with little progress, North Korean Foreign Minister Ryong Ho on Saturday blamed the US sanctions.
"Without any kind of trust in the United States, there is no certainty in our international security, so we cannot implement disarmament unilaterally first", Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is "crazy" and unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh insane and said she was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court by nature.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I think if a woman spoke like that now, they would call her 'crazy.'" Pelosi said in response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
When he talked about his family and his high school days, he was sometimes very emotional, and he would raise his voice and carry it.
Kavanaugh blamed the Democrats on the committee for what he called a "ridiculous and coordinated character assassination" by liberals angry at Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi argued that Kavanaugh's testimony proved he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because she said he was showing anti-democratic attitudes.
"I think that such statements and the way he spoke about Clinton and the Democrats disqualify him", she added.
Pelosi expressed disappointment when asked if he would be impeached if Kavanaugh was confirmed and Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm just saying -- if he's not willing to tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not fit to sit on the Supreme Court or in the position he's in", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he is concerned about what Kavanaugh's policies will be like against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, especially considering him a conservative legislator.
In his affirmative arguments, Kavanaugh ignored questions about whether certain Supreme Court decisions could be overturned.
"This is not the time for a crazy, easily influenced person to go to court and say, 'That would be great,'" Pelosi said.
And women need to use it.
It's a legitimate abuse, a deep rage that's been going on for months and years, but they can't show it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Ms. Steinmeier told me 45 years ago.
"I don't find anything unusual about it, do you?"
She continued, "There was a woman who was an executive at one place who helped me a lot, and she said that when she was angry, she would cry, and she would say that she developed the habit of crying when she was angry, and she would say to the person she was talking to, "You might think that I'm crying because I'm sad.
I'm mad at you".
Then they went on.
And I thought it was a very smart decision".
Tears are also allowed for excessive anger but are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of the most vivid memories of my previous job is that one day, in an office with a male-dominated staff, I was crying out of unmanifest anger, when a woman older than me, a manager I had always looked up to with fear, grabbed the scarf around my neck, pulled me down the stairs, and kicked me down.
"Don't let them see you cry", they told me.
"They don't know how angry you are.
They think you're too sad, so they'll be happy to bring you in.
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with him in Gary Hart's race for president.
In 1987, when Hart was caught off-guard on the boat called Monkey Business and thrown out of the race, Ms. Schroeder was very disappointed and thought there was no reason not to consider running for president herself.
"It was a very ill-considered decision", she told me with a smile 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates, and they never wanted another.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Since the campaign had been going on for a long time, they were too late to raise the money, so they vowed not to run until they had raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
Some of her supporters gave the men $1,000 dollars, and they realized they were only getting $250.
She wondered, "Do they think I will be of benefit?"
She was very emotional when she said in her speech that she was not running a political campaign - thanking her supporters, anger at the system that made it so difficult to raise money and focus on voters instead of representatives, anger at gender discrimination - all of which took her breath away.
"Everyone must have thought I was going to be nervous", Schroeder recalled, recalling the media reaction to him.
"You must have thought that Clinex was my corporate sponsor.
"I remember thinking, 'What are they going to put on my grave?'
"Did she cry?"
How does the U.S. trade war with China benefit Beijing?
Pragatbar said that while the trade war between the US and China is raging and the war is not over, a rift between the two countries would be beneficial for Beijing.
US President Donald Trump warned earlier this year of a tariff increase on Chinese exports, including solar panels, iron and aluminum.
The highlight of the week was the new price information for about $200 million worth of goods, of which almost half of the total goods coming into the U.S. from China are taxed.
Each time Beijing has retaliated in the same coin, recently raising tariffs of 5 to 10 percent on 60 million US goods.
China has vowed to retaliate against the United States, and the world's second largest economy will not suddenly lose its shine.
Rejecting the Washington Tone is like yielding to sanctions, but publicly yielding to the United States is embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
But Pragatbhar says that if Beijing can do things right, the US trade war pressure will reduce the interaction between the two economies and things will be in China's favor in the long run.
"A sudden political decision in Washington or Beijing that actually causes an economic collapse in either country could have consequences that are more dangerous than observers have concluded", said Abigail Grease, a research associate with a special focus on Asia at the Center for a New American Security.
Syria is 'ready' for the return of refugees, says Interior Minister
Syria says it is ready for the return of refugees and asks for help in rebuilding the country that has been devastated by seven years of war.
Foreign Minister Walid Al-Moullam said that the country's facilities are improving.
He said that the situation in the country is more stable and secure today because of the progress made in combating terrorism.
The administration is continuing efforts to normalize and resettle the provinces devastated by terrorists.
The refugees now have all the facilities they need to return, and terrorism and unilateral economic policies have affected their daily lives and forced them to leave the country.
The UN estimates that 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another 6 million people living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moullam said that the Syrian regime would accept any form of aid to rebuild the country.
He stressed that he would not accept conditional aid from countries that tried to create riots or from others.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup again in Paris
Team USA defeated Team Europe to claim the 2018 Ryder Cup, winning the final by a final score of 10-5 to 16-5 at Le Golf National in Paris, France.
This is the sixth consecutive defeat for the U.S. on European soil, and they have not won the Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe won the title again, beating the United States by 14.5 points under Danish captain Thomas Jorn.
US star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, put his tee shot in the water on the par-3 16th hole, giving up to Francesco Molinari in the match.
Italian golfer Molinari, who has performed brilliantly in all his rounds, became one of only four players to score 5-0 in the tournament since its inception in 1979.
The American Jordan Speth defeated the lowest ranked player in the European team, Thorb John Olsen of Denmark, 5-4
Dustin Johnson, the highest ranked player in the world, lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter in what may have been the last Ryder Cup of his career.
Having played in eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became one of the tournament's all-time leading scorers with 25.5 points.
"I'm not a quick-tempered person, but I couldn't help myself this time.
It's been a rough year.
I want to thank Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm very happy to have the cup back.
It's all teamwork, and I'm happy to be able to help with that", said Garcia, expressing his feelings about the European success.
He handed over the torch to fellow player John Rahm, who beat US golf legend Tiger Woods 2 & 1 on Sunday".
"I am very proud to have won Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him play", said 23-year-old Raham.
Tiger Woods lost all four games in France, and now he has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
With 14 major titles - only Jack Nichols has more - one of the greatest players of all time had a strange tactic.
Team USA struggled throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Fino, who had a strong showing throughout the tournament.
"I'm proud of them, they fought", said U.S. captain Jim Furyk after his team's disappointing performance.
There was a time this morning when we were pressuring Europe.
But we were broken.
Give my regards to Thomas.
He's a good captain.
And they all played well.
We'll reorganize, I'll work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup Committee, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 men, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You deserve to be commended.
"It's just that Ar played better than us".
Red Tide updates: The intensity is decreasing in Pinellas, Manati and Sarasota.
The Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission's latest report shows a general decline in red tide ratios along the Tampa coast.
Patchyer bloom conditions have been reported in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier, according to the FWC, indicating a decreasing severity.
Red tides are seen rising from the northern Penelope to the southern Lee in a blossom of about 130 miles.
Patches were seen in Hillsborough County, 10 miles off the coast, but it was less than previously seen.
Red tide was also observed in the Pasco area.
In the past week, moderate-to-high intensity weather was reported in coastal areas of Pinellas Province, low-to-high intensity weather in Hillsborough Province, extremely low-to-high intensity weather in Manatee Province, extremely low-to-high intensity weather in areas off the coast of Sarasota Province, extremely low-to-low intensity weather in areas off the coast of Charlotte Province, and extremely low-to-high intensity weather in areas off the coast of Lake Tahoe Province, and extremely low-to-high intensity weather in areas off the coast of Korea.
Respiratory problems continue in the provinces of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
But no respiratory problems have been reported in northwest Florida in recent weeks.
