Eemeli Kouki led the Hurricane at home opening - Savo Volley's second victory
The Hurricane-Loimaa, who had the Champions League medals seven times in a row, started the 2018-19 season with a home match, with Raision Loimu falling 3-0 on Saturday.
The general player Eemeli Kouki, who returned from Romania to Finland, was 22 points the most powerful of the Hurricane.
There were some movements abroad, but they did not realize, and then came a call from Loima.
It was quickly agreed, Kouki said.
As well as Tomi Rumpunen, who played in Loimusa, supported Koukia with 18 points.
The most efficient of the guests was the national team player Samuli Kaislasalo, playing with a match-specific agreement with 17 points.
The win of the game is always important.
Many players had experience from the opponent, and it brought additional extra to the game.
Our game is not yet ready, but the continuation of the medal is, of course, the goal, Kouki said.
The most efficient of Savo Volley
Miro Määttänen was Savo Volley's most powerful with 18 points, when the team defeated Vanta Vanta Ducks 3-0.
Our game was great, especially at the end of the attack, but fortunately we got a pressed victory.
I didn’t know anything about the different downloads when I played against my former team, Määttänen said.
Antti Siltala, who started his career in the 2000-01 season in the 3rd series, scored 12 points.
The coach Jukka Tuovinen was pleased with a lot of things.
The room was small and the atmosphere was on the roof all the time.
A good guy left home.
He was a good player, he was a good player, he said.
Siltala's previous season in the league was 2006-07, when he won the silver in Pielaveden Sammos Tuovisen while he was then the chief coach.
Thiago Maciel was Ducks' most powerful with 14 points.
Mikkonen is again the star of Akaa-Volley
In the 2012-13 season, Joni Mikkonen, who won the point stock exchange of the league, has started this season strongly.
The hacker made 25 points when Akaa-Volley took its opening win after defeating Kokola Tigers 3-2.
The season has started very well on its own.
Today we were close to defeat, because we were the fourth one with 17-21.
There was some mistake, and the fifth part came there at the same time, Mikkonen said.
A few years ago, the Tiger's most powerful was 28 points made by hacker Edvarts Buivids.
Alexander Kudrjashov supported by 17 points.
There was a little bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit.
Finland ranked 1st in the world in comparison of human capital
Finland is the world's top in comparison of human capital, the scientist newspaper Lancet says.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In the last two years, Finland was the first in the statistics.
In 2016 the top stone was almost the same as in 1990.
So far Finland followed Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later, the Netherlands was ranked one higher, and instead of Canada, Taiwan was on the list.
In 2016, Niger and South Sudan were the worst in comparison.
When measuring human capital, we look at the education level of the population, access to education, skills and health.
The World Bank has pointed out that human capital is linked to economic growth.
Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois held Atlético in court, the local game ended uncolored
Real Madrid's goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois went to brilliant races, and the local match of the Madrid teams ended with an uncolored match late on Saturday in the Spanish Football League.
Atlético Madrid's Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were the closest to the match, but the Belgian Courtois got to fight.
Courtois played at Atlético three times in a loanship as a Chelsea player.
In the first week, the International Football Federation (FIFA) selected him as the goalkeeper of the year.
In reality, the best place to play was Gareth Bale, but his shots turned over at the end of the goal opening half.
Bale stayed after a break because of a travel disadvantage.
According to ESPN, the disappointed Real supporters cried out the name of Cristiano Ronaldo who moved to Juventus during the match.
In the United States, the right to abortion is now being attacked - a powerful document explains why
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to find out if one of the nine members of the Supreme Court could choose President Donald Trump's candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In the Republican Party, many hope that Kavanaugh's decisive vote could abolish the decision known as Roe against Wade, which made abortion lawful in the United States in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary Reversing Roe - The United States and the Abortion Rights tells us how the current situation has come over the years.
As unbelievable as it seems, the topic is also up to date in Finland.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (sin) has done public work against safe abortion and has received a variety of support from the majority of the people in our country.
In the beginning of the powerful document, we meet with the gynecologist Colleen McNicholas, who has remained the only abortion doctor in the state of Missouri due to the laws.
The armed guard of the clinic says he is defending the U.S. freedom of religion.
The news video reminds us of the deadly terrorist attacks on clinics.
Abortion was illegal in the United States.
At that time, the Lutheran Church men’s association guided women to trusted abortion doctors.
The motivations of the interviewed pastor are good, but in fact they are not even needed, a photo of the dead woman for an abortion itself is enough.
Deaths occurred in the United States in about 5,000 years.
The legislation of abortion was supported by the Republican Party.
In 1967 the California abortion law was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later, Reagan, in his 1980 presidential campaign, began to reversibly confuse religion with politics in order to scratch voters.
His abortion was also accompanied by his successor George Bush.
The same was done by Donald Trump.
The document goes to the deepest core of the matter in search of the underlying cause for the politisation of abortion.
When religious organizations beneficial to racial separation were refused to be tax-free, they became politically active.
Abortion was chosen.
Religion has brought extraordinary nodes into politics.
In the U.S. we are in a situation in which the president, whose sexual harassment has called, but the voice of the religious right is attacked by his abortion, has chosen Kavanaugh as a supreme court candidate, who is now accused by many women of sexual harassment.
Kavanaugh has the power to decide on the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
Israeli army killed seven Palestinians, including two children, on the border with massive protests
More than 200 Palestinians have been killed in the last half of the year when Israel has shot off protesters in the border zone.
Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians on Friday in the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, two children were killed, 12 and 14 years old.
According to the Ministry, 505 people have been injured.
89 of them were injured.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened a fire and made an attack on the border zone when the protesters threw Israeli troops with stones and explosives.
The army says it has begun the use of force so that the protesters do not break the border ceiling or turn it to the other side.
At least 191 Palestinians have been killed in the Gaza Strip protests since March, when Palestinians began weekly protests on the border.
According to the United Nations Human Rights Commissioner, there are 12,000 people injured.
Protesters demand Palestinian families access to the territories from which Palestinians had to leave when the State of Israel was founded in 1948.
A Palestinian shooter has killed one Israeli soldier.
Explosives dropped by layers and helium balls from the Palestinian side have burned forest areas and agricultural lands in Israel.
He was sentenced to punishment, he could not shoot himself.
Wigan's topman, Chey Dunkley, appeared to have thrown him back in a burden in the punishment zone.
The judge Gavin Ward continued the game.
According to his interpretation, the clay was clean.
She couldn’t believe her eyes.
The situation seemed to be troubled by the arbitrator Wardia, who sentenced Norwich the punishment in the 85th minute when Pukki was thrown.
Ward showed a punishment point, and Mario Vrancic scored the 1-0 win.
He has scored five goals for Norwich in the Champions League.
The previous was born last Saturday against QPR with a stylish breast muscle.
The work tasted again.
After losing the ball, he continued until the end of the situation.
He created painting situations and defended without tiredness.
Norwich was the fifth in two weeks.
The team continues in the liigacup.
There is a five-winning pipe behind.
The aid service for pedophiles was filled immediately from the reservations - in Finland, about 40,000 people experience interest in children
It is estimated that two percent of men and a small portion of women experience at least some degree of sexual interest in the pre-age age.
In Finland, this means about 40,000 people.
Children or young people who are sexually interested have been difficult to get help.
The Criminal Care Support Foundation and Sexpo’s joint SeriE project will train professionals to meet pedophiles as customers and help people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was announced in the spring, the e-mail receipt began at Sexpos, which provides advice and therapy, and the meeting times were booked very quickly to the end, Yle says.
However, they are promised to be released by the autumn.
Sexual preference to children causes a lot of shame.
Most pedophile feelings in themselves have not realized their fantasies and thus did nothing criminal.
However, preference is usually a permanent feature.
Most of them hope to get rid of those thoughts that bother and depress them.
They also make a normal life difficult, says Sex Therapist Patricia Thesleff, who works as a special expert in the project.
I think work is valuable if one child is saved from sexual violence, says Thesleff.
Korean leaders or a Congolese gynecologist?
U.S. President Donald Trump as the Nobel Peace Prize winner - the idea may sound suddenly strange, but Trump is one of the biggest favourites as the prize winner according to the betting events.
In the background, Trump’s role in getting North Korea, at least at the level of talks, to commit to a nuclear breakthrough.
The most popular winners of the Nobel Peace Prize are South Korean President Moon Jae and North Korean President Kim Jong-un, who have met three times this year and have promised to pursue a peace agreement between their countries.
The warming between the Koreans is considerable, since the warming between the Koreans was very high last year.
Nevertheless, the reward of Kim, who has been the leader of nuclear weapons for years and the land with the iron pick, will undoubtedly raise criticism.
The Nobel Prize winners will be announced on Monday, and on Friday the peacekeepers will be the most attracted, the Peace Prize.
If the prize is not awarded to the Korean Peninsula diplomacy participants, one of the top candidates is the Kongo doctor Denis Mukwege.
A renowned gynecologist has been treating thousands of women victims of mass rape in his hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has become the world’s leading expert in the field.
In his work, Mukwege has attracted attention to sexual violence, which is a karma side product of many conflicts.
The United Nations Refugee Organization (UNFPA) won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981.
The Nobel Prize Committee has estimated that 331 candidates will be awarded this year.
The names of candidates are not revealed to the public.
Trump would not be worried if he received the Nobel Prize.
In May, a journalist asked him in the White House if he thought he deserved the Peace Prize.
“Everyone is of that opinion, but I’d never say it,” Trump said with a smile.
I want to make it ready.
The prize I want is a victory for the whole world, the president continued referring to the North Korean talks.
However, there are things that make Trump's Nobel unlikely.
The award-winning Norwegian Nobel Committee has often given recognition to individuals and organizations that represent liberal democracy and multi-dimensional world order – just the kind of international cooperation that Trump has seen as an opponent.
In the 2000s, the prize was awarded to three U.S. politicians who have all been Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2009.
Thus, Trump’s reward would require the Nobel Committee to be an ideological complete code.
A fire in the tunnel: drivers behaved like a snorkeling and were driving in the wrong direction
The road crash occurred on September 8th.
Traffic in the tunnel area was interrupted due to the announcement both to Turkey and Helsinki.
When it was revealed that it was a system error, the fire plant sought to make traffic normal.
However, it did not succeed very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Traffic Center said it cannot be opened because there are drivers on the road therefore shock and they drive how it hurt, the day-friendly firefighter Pasi Kääriäinen told the STT at that time.
The motorway was then left to drive even in the wrong direction just after a moment of waiting.
When the first begins to act against the traffic rules, a few others often follow, Traffic Safety Contact Manager Tapio Heiskanen surprises.
According to the traffic rules, motorways and tunnels should not be stopped for a compulsory reason.
Traffic safety reminds that in exceptional circumstances it is not possible to risk traffic with urgent solutions.
Alarm vehicles must always provide the most uninterrupted way possible.
Driving in the opposite direction on the motorway is prohibited, as well as making u translation and withdrawal.
The same prohibitions are also applicable in tunnels, where, in addition, the driving lights must always be connected.
Parking is also prohibited, as well as parking is prohibited.
There have been even cases where a driver has stopped in the tunnel to throw snow from his car.
It should be clear that it is the wrong place and time for that activity, Heiskanen says in the Traffic Safety statement.
Ilves fans would have wanted to continue their celebration even though the ship was stuck on the lake base
The Ilves fans transported by the interior vessel M/S to Tampere would have wanted to stay on the vessel to continue their victory celebrations, even though the vessel had been stuck in the lake base, says Juho Syrjä, who was the head of the vessel at the time of the event.
M/S Tampere, who was on the way from Hämeenlinn to Tampere, drove out of its route late Saturday night and was stuck in the bottom of the Vanajawater in Aka.
19 passengers and five crew members were evacuated to the continent.
No one was injured in the hole.
The Ilves fans would have wanted to continue their celebrations on the ship until the morning, but it was more reasonable to send them back to the port and the bus, Sirjä told STT.
Ilves fans were in Hämeenlinn following the match between Ilvekse and HPK, which ended with the 4-3 victory of Ilvekse.
According to Syriya, the hawer on Saturday was due to the fact that the surface of the water in the Vanaja water was about a half meter below the normal.
The navigation was also complicated by the fact that the nearest trail mark was covered by logs, which is why its reflectors were not normally visible in the dark shadow.
No more mentioned
The incident occurred on the west side of the narrow Jumusensalmen shortly after the shipping route had ended the motorway bridge between Tampere and Helsinki.
More dramaticity was not associated with the incident, according to Syria, as the speed of the ship was very low at the time of the incident and the crash to the ground did not cause a more mentioned collision.
According to Syriya, the catch on the ground has not caused ships to drop or shrink, and in these sights the ships’ crossroads continue normally.
The submarine went on Saturday morning to check the ship's condition before the ship began to be dropped from the bottom.
For the sake of security, we are still going to check that there was no damage, Syriya says.
Syriya believes that the next crossroads in M/S Tampere, bucked next weekend, can be treated in accordance.
The cruise period of the ship will continue until the Independence Day.
No use for ambulance
The rescue department received an alarm on Saturday after half a.m.
The port was alerted by the ambulance to receive the evacuated passengers, but the ambulance was not used.
The daily firemaster Matti Willman said late evening that the evacuation conditions in the lake were difficult due to darkness and quite heavy winds.
The Pirkanmaan rescue agency half after three on Sunday night that all the passengers on board had been evacuated and passengers were transferred by bus to Tampere.
The 1957 cruise has been renovated in the years 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Trump's judge candidate accused of intimidation and kidnapping may be left out of top
Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated as a judge of the U.S. Supreme Court, may well be missing the job he sought, says program director Mika Aaltola of the U.S. Foreign Policy Institute.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and misconduct during school.
Aaltolan said the suspicions have brought so much political pressure to the Republican Party that President Donald Trump may end up presenting someone else in office.
In the U.S. there has been a lot of controversy when the presidential candidate for the Supreme Court has raised a lot of controversy.
In this case, the judge's candidate is usually withdrawn by himself, says Aaltola.
The president has managed to keep his face.
Nomination for Democrats
The U.S. Supreme Court is seeking to be beyond politics, but at least in the case of Kavanaugh, the choice of a new judge has become a very political process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, the decision is likely to raise the Democratic Party in the upcoming interim elections.
It would raise voting frequency among young people and women who are more likely to vote for Democrats.
On the other hand, appointing a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for the Republicans.
The opportunity to be appointed does not affect every presidential term, as in the United States, the judges of the Supreme Court are appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have abandoned their own request for retirement at the age of about 70 to 80 years.
The Republicans also hesitate.
The candidates for the Supreme Court of the United States are normally undergoing a background examination, Aaltola says.
Although Trump has only set a week deadline for the FBI's further clarification, it may still show up something important, according to Aaltola.
It may bring.
There is rarely a smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
According to Aaltola, at least it is certain that Kavanaugh’s suitability or inappropriation to the office will be discussed even before the Senate makes its decision.
The Republicans have a majority of 51 to 49 votes in the Senate, but at least two female Republican senators are supposed to have a doubtful attitude towards Kavanaugh's nomination.
The worst thing would be that the nomination would be given to the vote and the Republicans would be lost.
A woman identified Salisbury as an agent of military intelligence
A Russian woman has told the BBC that she has identified the suspect of Salisbury poisoning as an agent of the Russian military intelligence service.
The woman said on the basis of the photos that it was a military representation of Anatoli Tshepiga working at GRU.
The online community Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia said earlier they had uncovered another suspect of poisoning men with the Tshepiga.
Earlier, they said they found evidence that the current identities of men are covered personalities.
The BBC group travelled to the Far East near a village on the border with Russia and China, where Tshepiga grew up.
A woman living in the village identified the young Tshepigan Bellingcat on the photos published.
He identified the same man on the images of the British police showing a man who now calls himself Ruslan Boshirov.
The Russians are suspected that former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter were poisoned with Novitshok nerve poison in March.
The scripts survived.
Eversti Tshepiga was awarded the Honorary Honor of the Russian Hero in 2014.
Russia continues to deny the suspicious GRU connection.
The suspects of poisoning said earlier in September in an interview with the Russian television they were in Salisbury as tourists.
The Old People in the War Reform
Now we have a living example of what the government of Siberia defines the war-reform limitator in practice means.
My birthplace Vaala sote-services is produced by the municipality of Oulunkaare, whose head of health services is the former regional director of Attendo elected in 2016.
The Board of Directors warns the authority of the change limitator.
If the military expenditure is now rising, the municipal state aid will be cut in the future.
The central decision makers of the municipality were shaken, and most of them are ready for a large structural reform of the elderly care, which would end the facility of the health center’s bed department and the unit of small memorial diseases.
Home care would be added, which means long distances in Vaala the fact that the elderly living in the remote villages are cut off from their roots near the health center as a "home" to be treated.
Attendo believed that the municipality would pay for it to its customers.
The leftist party did not sweat a bad preparation, but organized a good public event, with a lot of relatives, neighborhoods, and also authorized by other parties.
I presented the deo of the war-region preparation, how in the municipality of Vaala older people are treated at home most in the northern part of the country.
In addition, the neighborhood authorized Carina West was involved.
The local newspaper made a big story about the opportunity, and it again raised the preparers of the Oulunkaara to their backs.
Sote manufacturers do not write on any paper that Attendo has built a new housing in Vaala, which is now waiting for empty inhabitants.
There are no other service providers.
The preparers are talking only about the service chain, but they don’t tell what level of care it receives or what staff structure Attendo will take care of the elderly until the treatment.
Without a nurse?
The medical facility is closed because there is no doctor's nighttime.
Attention will also take care of the doctors of the Vaala Health Center.
The Vala example tells us how central officials turn the authorized with the lack of knowledge and the authorized are put back on the wall with a change limitator.
Thus the central party will empty the inhabitants of the Vaala, because who remains there unsafe to reside voluntarily if there is a chance to move away.
Was the center one electoral proverb that the whole country was held as a resident?
Turkish President Erdogan opened a large mosque in Cologne
In Germany, thousands of people in the city of Cologne showed their minds when the visiting Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan opened the largest mosque in Europe.
Hundreds of people had gathered on the beach since the morning.
Erdogan is not welcomed, he read in the balls of the protesters, and in the shots, fascism was condemned.
During Erdogan's visit on Thursday, several demonstrations have been held, and security measures have been strict.
In Cologne, about 10,000 people were expected to protest in advance on the streets, including the human rights situation in Turkey.
In the vicinity of the Great Mosque, Erdogan’s supporters were also gathered.
However, the police had isolated the large area from the mosque environment for security reasons.
In his open speech, Erdogan said his visit to Germany was successful and said it was strengthening the relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met with Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
Erdogan and Merkel swear on Friday to rebuild relations that have deteriorated significantly since the 2016 Turkish coup attempt.
However, Merkel stressed that there are profound disagreements between the countries, among other things, on human rights issues.
Review surrounds the visit
Both Cologne mayor Henriette Reker and North Rhine-Westphalia Prime Minister Armin Laschet canceled their participation in the opening after the criticism of Erdogan's visit was accelerated.
A 30-year-old student from Turkey, Cansu, said he had arrived in Switzerland to demonstrate against Erdogan.
I want to be a voice for those who cannot leave the streets in Turkey.
They have been arrested, murdered and submitted.
For Erdogan, everything that differs from his own thought is terrorism.
In the last stage of Erdogan’s journey to Germany, a significant portion of the population in North Rhine-Westphalia is of Turkish origin.
Three people accused of murder of a journalist
Three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
The prosecutor said on Friday that three people were accused of the February murder of Kuciak and his spouse, as well as other crimes.
Earlier this week, the police arrested eight people in the investigation of the murder, but five of them were released.
Kuciak was found in February shooting with his spouse at his home in Bratislava.
He had investigated the links between politicians and the Italian mafia.
The police have suspected the murder was linked to the investigations of Kuciak.
The case and the article published in Kuciak have raised concerns about the freedom of the media and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be trouble in distribution on Sundays.
Due to the error in printing, Sunday Karjalainen will also have to be posted as an addressless.
This may appear in the distribution of the newspaper in decentralization areas where the distribution into joint boxes must be performed from the outside.
The situation was the same for the newspaper on Saturday, and the problem may continue on Monday.
The post puts additional newspapers in the province.
The newspapers of the other Finnish subscribers will be posted separately only on Monday.
The distribution of these newspapers is significantly delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut.
The reporter Arto Nyberg will interview today in direct on his upcoming discussion program, including Vesa Heilalaa.
The studio tells him about his upcoming space trip, which he booked from the Virgin Galactic in 2010.
The price was 151,000 euros, which needed a bank loan to pay.
If the original plans were true, Vesa would have been in space a long time ago.
The date of departure has been delayed a year by year.
Now it seems that after the unfortunate attempt that took place in 2014 and claimed deaths, things are right.
If everything goes well, commercial flights will begin this year or not later than next year.
The Vesa flight number is 300, which means its journey is about a year from the first departure.
The flight will take 2.5 hours and be in a weightless state for 5 minutes at a height of 100 kilometers, the Finnish astronaut says on his home page.
In the same address, he also follows his search for space.
As a child, I read a cartoon called Space Journey and watched the Star Trek TV series.
The Star Wars has been seen, and that’s why the idea has remained connected...
Why not ?
Everyone has his own dreams.
Manchester City was a host.

Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Räikkönen and surprised Ferrara: "Lost a very important driver"
In an interview with the Swiss newspaper Blicke, Mersun's British man was asked if he believed that Kimi Räikkös' release from Ferrar's services would help Hamilton in the end of the season.
Hamilton leads Ferrari's second jury Sebastian Vettel with 40 points.
A little less than three weeks ago, Ferrari announced that Räikkönen would not continue to play in the next season, and at the same time, Räikkönen announced that he would move to Sauber.
Hamilton, of course, doesn’t believe that Räikkönen would hit the hips.
I don’t think Kim will change in the remaining matches.
He is an exceptional professional - a fantastic driver.
He remains one of my favourites and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It has no sense for me.
Hamilton has previously said that Räikkönen has been one of his examples.
I don't know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and dreamed of Formula One, I played the F1 game on PlayStation all the days.
I’ve always been Kimi, which is pretty crazy, Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season will continue on Sunday with Russia's competition.
The race starts at 4 p.m. with Mercedes Valtteri Bottas.
The show follows the moment.
Football A-Youth SM series championship was a full farce: the opponent arrived at the spot with only 7 players.
The highest level of football boys ends on Saturday, when the last round of the season will be played.
Before the round started at 13 p.m., the outcome points for the championship were clear: FC Lahti Academy is practically enough to score a point against Vasa IFK.
In order to turn the situation in the last round, the second in the championship, Ilveksen, must win the PK-35 and desire the defeat of the golfers.
But the championship was practically guaranteed already before the start, as Vasa IFK had arrived in Lahti with only seven players.
If there were a few players, the game would not have been started.
FC Lahti Academy won the match 16-0.
The balls led by 7-0.
One reason for the failure is that the team has played partly with the same players in the A-Youth SM series, i.e. the P20 series and the Men's Twelve C series.
Vasa IFK has played in the Twenty Practice against the fall throughout the season.
With a twenty-first decision round on Saturday, Vasa IFK is forced to win JBK in a guest match and at the same time hopes that Tampere United will lose its own guest match against KuFua in Silinjärve Toiva.

Serena Williams is an emergency with a video in which she sings in the upper part - campaigns for breast cancer awareness
Tenis superstar Serena Williams is back.
Now she is campaigning to raise awareness of breast cancer by posting a video on her Instagram account in which she only sings hands in front of her breasts, the news agency told AFP.
The song was released in 1991 by the Australian Divinils, I Touch Myself.
In the video, Williams supports the Australian Breast Cancer Association’s activities.
“I called the worldwide hit of The Divinils to remind women of doing regular self-activity audits,” Williams wrote in his Instagram message.
And yes, this put me into the discomfort zone, but I wanted to do it because the topic affects all women, regardless of skin color, all over the world.
Early discovery is everything a and o - it saves many lives.
The second author of The Divinils is Chrissy Amphlett, who died from breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
Music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, made in honor of Chrissy Amphlett.
"He died of breast cancer but gave us a hit song to remind women to put their health in the first place," Williams says.
The video has been viewed 1.5 million times.
It was published early on Sunday morning.
In the video comment, Williams is praised for his courage.
Williams left the Beijing tennis tournament earlier this week.
This is the backdrop of the U.S. Open tennis tournament three weeks ago.
Williams shot the match's chief judge and, among other things, claimed that men are accepted much more restrictive behavior than women.
A Chinese restaurant on the mountain road is not suitable for height injuries
In addition to traditional Chinese flavours, the restaurant offers magnificent landscapes.
A restaurant in the Chinese province of Zhejiang is opened.
It is literally located in the language of the canyon.
If you want, you can see the forest.
The remaining landscapes at the heights make restaurants visitors cheer in the mountains of Longquan.
Access to the restaurant requires a walk in the middle of the persian trees.
The restaurant opened for tourists on September 19, 2018.
The comments on YouTube wonder where the restaurant's bath is located.
A walk to the restaurant requires a good foundation, the location is.
This is the end of the day, this is the end of the day.
Everything good ends in time.
Today, this is the case for the domestic landdrama of the Corpel's shadow, which has been quiteined.
The third production season has gone like hot stones: last week the season was viewed by 722,000 Finns as a television premiere.
The highlights in themselves no longer have any practical significance, as the series of Heikki Creoman and Jukka Mäkisen is not going to be a continuation.
In the final period, the relationship between Jaskan and Mirkou is once again taking a mind-harp forward, and the mother of Jaskan seems to be the first to think about what the future will be.
The intersection between Anss and Misa is warm, in the light of recent events directly romantic, but then in the patterns the Laiho again appears.
The police have a doubtful attitude towards the man.
Nevertheless, no one of you can imagine the fate of Layout in advance.
Anita, in turn, gets to hear incredible news.
The last will of the far is revealed, which brings the woman to the edge of tears.

The show will be on TV1 at 21.05.
Is it worth going to work tomorrow with a small flu?
Facts for and against
The flu season is hot.
A lot of people stay at home or not.
However, it is worth thinking about whether it is worth other people to go to infect because the disease can be infectious even if the symptoms are small.
Sometimes the symptoms of flu suddenly hit, sometimes they appear in the hips.
In the latter option, you may already infect others, even if your symptoms seem small, says the Prevention publication.
Is it worth staying home?
According to the prevention, the flu is infectious even when the person itself has no symptoms.
The virus is infected a day before the symptoms begin and then from five days to a week.
Children can infect the disease for longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you should not be at school or at work.
You can return to work when the cough is relieved and the fever is no longer, says Professor of Medicine Gregory Poland.
Training should also be avoided.
Too fast return to the room will slow the recovery.
Also remember to wash your hands, moisturize the nasals and throw the rubber papers into the rubbish.
Painful to move?
If you have to leave the home when you are sick, consider using a protective mask.
The mask does not keep the viruses curated, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
Then the fingers will not be placed on the nose or mouth, Poland says.
The minds are also limited to the machine.
How can infection be avoided?
The best way is to keep your hands washing and avoid touching your face.
The latter is difficult to avoid.
For example, in the United States, an average person touches his eyes, nose or mouth every 15-30 seconds, Poland warns.
New Miss Finland repeats the mysterious tradition: "My husband is a hockey coach"
The ice cream and the ice cream are often combined with each other.
This was the case with Alina Voronkov, 23.
The 2018 Miss Finnish Crown was awarded by Alina Voronkova.
She is currently living in the city where she moved at the age of 15.
Alina's mother is an Inker-Swedish and her father is a Russian.

My mother and father moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was tempted because of my Russianity.
In Pertunland I had no friends at all, Alina tells me at the announcement ceremony of the Miss Finland semi-finals.
After graduation, Alina decided to start with a clean table and move to Lake to go to high school.
Soon the missile found new friends and the day went to roll hopefully.
When I was 15 years old, I thought I was an adult, but I did not think about it.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner, Joonas Hurrin, who is familiar with the Pelicans lines.
After the SM league career, the hockey player has played abroad, such as Sweden and China.
In 2009 he participated in the 18 year old World Cup.
At the beginning of the struggle, the couple was almost a year away, but later Alina was able to travel with her husband to the world.
If I get into the winning triangle and thus I get a career, then I don’t want to believe that it would affect our relationship in any way.
Even if we had to live separately, then our trust works well and in the distance it is the good side that it as the primary point remains above the meeting time, Alina virnist in May.

Previous Post Previous post: The world’s strongest man lost dozens of pounds
In 2017, the world’s strongest man, Eddie Hall, is undergoing a dramatic transformation.
The British Eddie Hall hunted the title of the world's strongest man for a long and determined time.
Hall could eat up to 10,000 kilokalories per day for food and weighed 200 kilograms, according to the Mirror magazine.
The shirt was 5XL.
Before winning the title, Hall acknowledged he was hurting his body.
The human body is not created to be this size, Hall said.
The British hunted the winning of the world's strongest man in all means and the family man promised to end his career if he got the title.
Hall didn’t want her children to grow up without her father.
Hall fulfilled his promise, and he was no longer seen in the April 2018 World's strongest man competition.
Soon Hall posted a picture on Instagram in which he poses his active career significantly in a thinner state.
Hall writes that his current weight is 169,5 pounds.
Hall has written his training today five times a week aerobically.
The program includes racing, cycling and swimming.
In addition, Hall performs four exercises a week at the gym.

The previous Finnish winner is Janne Virtanen, who was one in 2000.
The restaurant ship M/S Tampere crashed in the St. Lake - "Fastly stuck with a stone"
The interior water vessel M/S Tampere flew late Friday afternoon on the Akha St. Lake.
The rescue agency received a warning of a water traffic accident on Friday after 12 p.m.
The 30-metre ship M/S Tampere has crashed on the shell, and is strongly stuck with a stone, described the day-friendly firemaster Matti Willman.
The ship had 19 passengers and five crew members.
The rescue agency said human injuries were avoided.
Passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated to the continent from the ship.
Now they are transferred by bus toward Tampere, the day-friendly chief Jari Nieminen told STT at 1 a.m.
The port was alerted by ambulance to receive evacuated passengers.
The ship that travelled from Hämeenlinn to Tampere had for some reason moved away from its route on the west side of the narrow Jumusensalme.
Police are investigating the cause of the incident.
The firefighter Matti Willman said earlier this evening that the conditions on the lake are difficult due to darkness and quite heavy winds.
The rescue agency said the fate of the ship was unclear.
The ship does not appear to fall.
The submarines begin after the evacuation operation to check what the situation is there on the ground.
Built in 1957, M/S Tampere is currently a restaurant ship, with a maximum allowed number of passengers of 180 people.
The ship also has a private meeting room to be rented.
According to the ship’s website, the cruiser has been renewed in the years 2001, 2014 and 2017.

Former managers call for unpaid remunerations from Robert Helenius
Robert Helenius's night match against Erkan Teperi shades money.
VITA-SANOMAT informs today the boxing manager Jaakko Helmisen and the rescue judge Jussi Kokkilan about the appeal, in which Helenius with the delay rates is charged with unpaid manager payments for a total of more than 80,000 euros.
According to the interview, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helenius 15.4.2014-30.1.2015.
We have tried to agree, but there is no other option.
Here has been a clear order, and the work has been done very much, Kokkila says to Vita-Sanom.
The current manager of Helenius, Markus Sundman, sent an answer to Iltalehd, telling about the event the view of the basketball player.
Helenius denies that he is obliged to pay the required amount.
According to his reply, Kokkila and Helminen had provided their services to Helenius in a financial situation and promised to be able to organize matches and sponsorship revenues for him.
It was verbally agreed that Helenius is obliged to pay awards only per cent of his matches.
It was repeatedly assured that Helenius had nothing to pay, only to receive the income they organized.
This is also the normal and only practice in the management activity of professional athletes.
The salary has never been agreed and that would have been unreasonable in the situation of Helenius, Sundman explains in his latest message.
There has never been a written agreement.
According to his reply, Helenius had from the beginning wanted to agree on the income distribution in writing, but Kokkila and Sundman received the draft until the end of 2014.
He declared the proposal as a body for himself and would break the cooperation with Kokila and Helmisen.
Helenius did not take it once when he was in contact with Kokila and Helminen.
A year after the end of the cooperation, Helenius was given a "unparalleled but measurable" calculation of the manager's work.
This year, the same claims have been filed.
Helenius considers the subsequent activity of Helminen and Kokila as a crush, in return it is stated.
Helenius will meet today in Stuttgart with Erkan Teper, the seventh in the IBF’s heavy series challenge.
A good man and a good journalist.
The entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio was aware of the disappearance of the radio broadcaster and reporter Erkki Pälli for decades.
Long line radio broadcaster and reporter Erkki Pälli died at the age of 83, from unhealing liver cancer.
The death announcement was published on Sunday in Helsinki.
It is that he died on September 3.
Pälli a serious illness on his Facebook page in March 2018.
The publication was also seen at that time by Ile Vainio, whom the knowledge of the fate of the acquainted afflicted.
He has already left on Facebook as if he was saying goodbye.
He considers Erkki Pälli as a multidisciplinary expert, who became a great journalist.
He remembers that Pälly was considered a man with fast hocks and fun stories.
I learned to know Erk as a little boy when I first visited Finnlevy at the age of 12 and started there as a warehouse.
We met with Erika.
He was then Finnlevy's informant and in various tasks, Ile Vainio reminds.
When I advanced to make albums as a music producer, there were hundreds of occasions where Erkki Pälli was a regular editor at all the festivals making stories about the artists.
She was always expert and saw how big fire she had for entertainment, music and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he came directly to the skin of his interviewers.
He was a good man and a good journalist.
For many, he became known as a prestigious Ylu radio singer, but he also wrote great newspapers.
He also interviewed me several times.
He was good to speak, and he was good to speak.
Over the course of decades, Pälli worked in addition to reporter work in the Fazer-levy company with Toivo Kärjen.
He worked as a music producer on the Vesa-Matti Loire discs.
But Polly's greatest passion was the radio work, where he had his own style.
He has been working on radio since the 1960s, and he became known to numerous listeners in the Ylen ether.
He retired in 1998.
The Finnish Ski Association announced on Saturday that the financial year that ended in May showed a profit of about 450,000 euros.
The Union describes its economic situation as an experienced “full regulation”, although the economy is, of course, burdened by “a significant debt in balance”.
Executive Director Mika Kulmala calls for a quick reaction and a rigorous economic crisis.
We will react to the situation as soon as possible last autumn by taking adaptation measures.
The careful planning of the operations and the financial management have been overwhelmed throughout our organization, Kulmala says in a statement.
We also succeeded well in the partnership and, in addition, the world cup winnings were the maximum in the past competition season.
However, in the future, the cost management must be accurate, and at the same time, we must constantly look for new financial models.
I heard my wife crying for help, but then came silence.
Dozens of bodies lie on the back of a hospital in the town of Palu on the island of Sulawes, Indonesia.
Only one building separates them from the area to which the injured survivors are gathered to assess the need for injuries and care.
Patients are also treated outside for post-trauma.
One of the people in the hospital area was a 52-year-old firefighter Baharuddin, who was searching for his son.
As many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
I have one child and he is missing.
I last talked to him when he was going to school, Baharuddin told AFP.
At the army hospital's shelter in Palussa was Dwi Haris, who has been injured in his back and arms.
He was at the start of the shock in a local hotel with his wife and daughter.
The family was invited to the wedding party.
I was probably stuck under the wall that collapsed.
I heard my wife crying for help, but then there came silence.
I don’t know what happened to him and my child.
I hope they are safe, Haris told the news agency AP, according to British media.
Small shops are stolen.
The 35-year-old baby's mother, Risa Kusuma, tried to calm her baby from the fever.
He described the atmosphere in the city as tight.
There is little clean water.
Small shops are stolen everywhere, Kusuma said.
Many of the inhabitants of Palu have been sleeping outside or in temporary bamboo houses.
Even if the house was somehow standing, possible post-trauma could destroy it definitively and buried the inhabitants in the desert.
According to news agency AP, more than half of the prisoners who were in the Palu prison fled after the walls of the prison collapsed.
There were about 560 prisoners, so there are about 300 refugees.
Also some of the prisoners in the Donggala prison have fled, reports The Jakarta Post.
According to the newspaper, the prisoners were angry and burned the prison into the fire after the guards had refused to leave to search for their relatives who suffered from the earthquake and the tsunami.
The airport has been reopened mainly for support flights.
Among the first, the C-130 aircraft of the Army landed on the ground, bringing assistant equipment.
Commercial flights to Palu field are allowed only limited.
Pilots are forced to land on the ground without the help of the airline, as the airline control tower was severely damaged in the earthquake.
Rain runs over Finland at night
A long rain area will spread across the country on Sunday night from the west, according to the Institute of Meteorology.
The rain will mostly rain, but in the Central and North West there is a rain or snow expected.
The last night's blows are not repeating, because the temperatures under the clouds remain higher.
A cloudy night keeps the lowest temperatures quite effectively.
Just in the west you can instantly go to the side of the package, said the day-friendly meteorologist Ville Ilkka.
On Sunday, the rain area goes to the east in the morning.
In the south and west there is a puto or half cloud.
In the afternoon, the temperatures move always to the Oulu height at the 10-13 degrees stage.
The starting week looks similar in terms of temperatures in the south and central parts of the country, but the weather becomes more unstable.
There are wind and wave warnings.
Real storms are not expected in the coming days, but otherwise there is a typical autumn variable weather.
The autumn begins to be very serious, he said.
The final is not seen on television.
From IL-TV you can watch the glamour and glamour of the red matte of the Miss Finland competition.
Evening entertainment reporters are drawing a direct broadcast on IL-TV from the red floor of the Miss Finland final from Billnäsin ruuk.
The broadcast starts around 18.50.
The new Miss Finland will be crowned on Saturday among the ten finalists.
The Miss Finland 2018 final will be held at Raasepor in Billnäs.
Before the final start, you will be able to follow the atmosphere from the spot in the live broadcast of IL-TV.
The live broadcast starts around 18.30 and lasts for about an hour.
This year, a lot of the winners of the previous years have been invited to the final.
They were represented by Miss Finland in 1998 by Jonna Ziprus.
Other representatives of the jury are the well-being entrepreneur Jutta Gustafsberg, photographer Nadi Hammouda, Joun Commerce CEO Minttu Murphy-Kaulanen and Seiskan news producer Katja Lintunen.
We hoped that he would go to the university before leaving Mississippi.
The Russian dad Dimitri and the Inker mother Svetlana believed their daughter to succeed in the Miss Finland final.
The parents of the new Miss Finland, Alina Voronkov, Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova proudly followed the first moments of their daughter on the crown.
They came to the audience from Pertunma and intended to drive back home after the final.
A wonderful atmosphere!
We believed in Erika all the time, but half an hour before the result began to get excited, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is an Inker and Dimitri is a Russian.
Alina speaks smoothly Russian, although she has lived throughout her childhood in Finland.
Svetlana tells us that Alina was younger and more interested in acting and many other things than any other career.
Alina was often told that when she’s so nice she should start with a little bit.
But he said he wanted to be a radio player.
Later, Alina was enthusiastic about the beauty competition.
The parents wanted Alina to go to the university before participating in the Miss Finland competition.
This was the way, and finally Alina wanted to get a bachelor's degree before the Mississippi.
We already asked last year why he didn’t participate, but he wanted to make it ready.
Parents believe that Alina won the competition because it is a healthy example for both young people and adults.
He does a lot of exercise and is eating healthy.
And Alina likes to be present, it looks like.
Alina's boyfriend, Joonas Hurri, tries to work in Japan and fails to get to Finland to encourage his love in the final.
Alina's parents believe that the youth relationship will last any year.
That is the purpose!
The parents hoped that their daughter would come soon.
There has been a long break for visitors because of the missiles.
I’m sorry, even if there are messages.

Sari Piippo left his career in Brussels and became a home mother in Finland - the idea of cartoon came to mind: the lack of drawing skills did not slow down
The story was once out of my husband’s statement, in which he proposed it as a person in the story I developed, says the Spanish cartoon blogger, home mother and former EU translator Sari Piippo.
Sari Piippo says she was in Brussels as an EU translator for economic and legal affairs until after her fourth child, the family became a return mutant ten years ago.
I have been very pleased as a home.
This was the best time in my life, but at some point I remembered what the big would do when the little child began to be big.
Then in 2014 the picture became a cartoon.
Piippo says he had never dreamed of making a cartoon, even though he had read Aku Anka, Tint and Asterix as little.
I had last drawn it as a child, but when these manuscripts of the Creature Shadow began to emerge then the situation changed.
In the beginning, I made a few dozen manuscripts in the table box.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (s. 2000) is a skilled painter, but I didn’t get her attracted until the summer of 2016, when I gave Viivi with a drawing disk.
His passion lasted a dozen stripes, and then he was forced to start trying himself, laughing Piippo, who tells the drawing plate was a great incentive for him.
Drawing is a simple and convenient tool to try to get something done.
I didn’t even try to draw on paper, Piippo tells him about his relationship with drawing, which he usually practices in the evening.
Manuscripts pops in mind constantly, but usually I don't make it ready at once.
A total of three stripes will take even more than a few hours.
I can play with the colors and I can play with the colors.
Starting drawing is always the hardest, because drawing is not my strongest kind.
Sari Piippo says he appreciates newspapers’ contemporary pictures, including Scott Adams’s Dilbert.
As a person of organic harassment, the L-theme is a pork-like mother with a salad hairstylist.
Other persons are Man, Pissis and Twins.
In the human world, the human being is what he eats.
The ideas of the series come from your own life and social media.
Sari Piippo doesn’t want to preach or offer forced bull even if the Creature Hole is penetrated between things.
Piper says he will read his series to his husband and his children.
It’s a great feeling when you look at the cartoon and find that this is what I’ve done today.
And the challenges are enough for the households!
The series can be read online at www.series.ablogit.com

Indonesian earthquake: Airline manager killed himself - didn't leave a broken tower until he saved hundreds of passengers
The hero of the Indonesian earthquake is the 21-year-old airline leader Anthonius Gunawan Agung.
Agung stayed alone in the airline tower until he was able to transport hundreds of passengers with a passenger plane to travel safely from the island struck by the earthquake.
The young man was on his headquarters at the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport in the city of Palu when the earthquake hit on Friday.
As the others fled from the flight control tower, Agung refused to leave his place before being guided by Batik Air’s passenger plane from the airfront.
This could save hundreds of lives, the Indonesian Aviation Administration told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri airport on Saturday after the earthquake.
The aircraft brushed and broke.
Finally, Agung tried to save himself by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg was broken and he had serious injury.
He was sent to a nearby hospital.
He was scheduled to be transported by a helicopter to a better-equipped facility, but he died 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, a representative of the aviation administration told The Jakarta Post.
The earthquake continued to increase when the flight reached the air, and its intensity was eventually measured at 7.5 magnitude.
At least 832 people died.
The Indonesian Aviation Administration has respected Agung's heroism on social media.
Rehn thought about the end of his trade war: "We need to watch the next tweet"
The trade war between the United States and China is reflected in the entire world economy.
Growth forecasts have been calculated throughout Europe and the Bank of Finland has also slightly lowered its own economic growth estimates.
CEO Olli Rehn said in Yle's first meeting that although the increasing tension has no direct impact on the European trade flows, it undermines confidence, which in turn reflects on corporate investment decisions.
This also applies to Finnish exports.
I think Europe is a good bread for now.
It has been able to build peace with the United States and has contributed to calming the situation also with China and Japan.
The European Union does not seem to have a trade war on its feet.
You need to look at the next tweet and then evaluate it.
We have a pretty unpredictable partner in the direction of Washington, however, he said Yle in an interview.
Europe has its own risks.
One of them is the third-largest national economy in the euro area, Italy, which is also one of the most debtful states in the euro area and the entire western world.
The markets reacted sharply yesterday afternoon by the Italian government to clearly present a deficit budget.
In the next year, the deficit will be more than 2.4 per cent of the national product.
It is concerned about the situation in Italy.
Five percent of the country’s loans are problem loans and more than ten percent are unregulated loans.
Furthermore, its public economy is in weak burden and the country again seems to exceed its commitment to its European partners.
It may not be worth painting further new crises, Rehn replied when asked whether Italy would come to a new economic crisis in Europe.
The second issue of Europe is the UK’s disagreement with the EU.
Rihanna hoped it would fit.
The controversial difference would have much more negative effects.
Rehn started as the Chairman of the Bank of Finland in July.
European Central Bank (ECB) chief executive Mario Draghi will resign within a fair year.
The discussion of his followers has begun.
Both the name of Rehn and his predecessor Erkki Liikasen has been glorified in the speeches.
It doesn’t bother if Finnish names are included, Rehn said and added that he won’t comment on the matter further.

During the evening, the journalists and photographers present on the stage tell a long-prepared true story that has not previously been published in any of the HS media.
There is something that no one has ever heard of.
“There are strange spies in the night of Helsinki, impressing your report on the other side of the world, and a narrative of a very up-to-date health issue,” says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of Black Box.
After the presentation, the audience will have the opportunity to meet the journalists and photographers of HS and to continue the discussion.
Helsinki News has been organizing live journalism nights for three years.
They have been popular from the beginning and often sold out.
More than 15,000 people have already visited.
The Black Box was awarded in the Bonnier Gallery as a journalist of the year.
The winners thanked for the new way to do journalism and the desire of journalists to get close to their readers.
The Black Box of the Spring 2019 will be seen at the National Theatre in March-April.
The show will also be visited in Tampere and the Market.
The presentation is different from the presentation at the same time.
The missing fungus was found thanks to an "unprecedented experiment"
The Finnish police’s drone expertise is the world’s top: “We are asked for training”
According to the director of the police college, the police can use the drone in addition to searching for missing persons, for example, in criminal locations investigation and intelligence tasks.
On Tuesday, the police were able to find a missing fungus using a drone in just a few minutes.
Kimmo Himberg, the director of the Police School of Science, quoted the case and said, among other things, that "with unprecedented trials and effective training we are the key to the world here too."
The drone is a pretty new captivity and even more new in police tasks.
There is no statistics that the Finnish police would be the master of the use of drones.
According to Himberg, there is a strong idea that this is the case.
This has happened, for example, when the Finnish police experience has been in international events.
There is a lot of interest in it elsewhere, Himberg says.
It would be hard for visitors to see the Finnish police’s drone operation.
We are asked for training.
increased further
Himberg reminds that finding the lost in Finland in winter conditions as soon as possible is very important.
The missing man was found by the drone in just a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
He added that he should be trained more.
For now, drones are widely used in police tasks, and their use will be increasing and increasing in the future.
That’s what I dare to say, Himberg says.
In addition to searching for missing persons, the police may use drones, for example, to investigate an accident or a crime site and to perform certain intelligence tasks.
For example, it is already necessary to check some area a little further, where we may be afraid that there will be violence.
The drone can be used for pre-representation.
Karjalan Rugby to 1st Divar
Karjalan Rugby celebrates the victory of the 2nd division on Saturday.
The rivals were still in the middle of the match with a 7-12 defeat to the Helsinki Rugby Club, but they found the line in the second season and fought the southern guests 26-12.
The 2-division champion also knew Karela Rugbyl's historic rise to the 1-division.
Previously, the team has played in the first place, but at that time the Finnish rugby series activity was divided into two levels, the SM series and the multiplayer 1 division.
The team is planning to take the cast, but it knows a lot of work for the next winter.
The current roster of less than twenty players must be grown to 25.
The 1 division also knows the growth of the number of games and the longer game routes, so the fundraising must also be consistent with it.
Coach starts season in Montreal, strengthens head coach
The head coach of Montreal Canadiens, Claude Julien, on his Twitter account confirmed that the Finnish attacker, Jesperi Kotkaniemi, will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal booked a super promise for Kotkaniemen, 18, in the first round with the number three in the summer reservation event.
The attacker joined the training strength of Montreal since the end of the summer and has shown strong drawings in the training matches of September.
He managed to score the goal in his first training match.
Head coach Julien said the Finnish had taken big developments after arriving in the outcome camp.
The NHL season starts on Thursday night.
Montreal will meet Toronto Maple Leafs.
What is a good leader?
This week, a lot has been discussed in Finland.
Nokia’s chairman Risto Siilasmaa told HS in an interview with his book Paranoid optimist, in which he emphasizes his leadership philosophy.
At the same time, he criticizes the leadership of his predecessor Jorma Ollila.
Ollila strongly denied the accusations, but Nokia’s previous reports have also talked about the managers’ incapacity to act as a team; fear and discouragement, which in part caused the collapse of the mobile business.
The company’s risk-risk capacity and chainability have disappeared.
This week in Helsinki was also held the Nordic Business Forum, which brought to the Messuk Center the Finnish business frame.
In addition to Barack Obama, there are 12 business stars.
Talk about good leadership is enough.
The legend Gary Hamel said that a good manager must dare to bring the company to the future even when the company is going well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are mentally most linked to past decisions.
John Mackey, the founder of Whole Foods, said that the manager must know how to communicate to the entire staff the purpose of the company.
And that may not be the only purpose of making a profit to the owners.
Susan Cain, the writer of the Introverts Book of Success, said that the most successful leaders are studied to be humble.
They act calmly, quietly and determinedly.
They are often introverted.
Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance, recalled that the qualities of a good manager must match the phase of the company’s lifecycle.
In the early stages of the company, the manager must know how to tell the story on which the future of the company is based.
A company that grows to a mature stage needs a manager who knows the numbers.
These lessons at the Nordic Business Forum were listened to 7,500 visitors - mostly Finnish leaders.
They were at risk of information.
A good leader requires a lot.
This is why leadership goes so often wrong, even at the highest level.
There were also Silasmaa and Ollila.
They talked with each other in the corner.
But they hardly wondered if they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And their humility was not easy to assess outside.
Sara Chafak arrived on a magnificent red hole directly from Los Angeles - spending most of his year abroad
Model Sara Chafak arrived in the mission in a magnificent black dress.
The 2012 Miss Finland's spectacular dress also had a pizzic shirt.
A little bit of a jet.
I came back from Los Angeles.
I spend most of my time there, Chafak tells me about his membership.
Chafak says he’s going to go to the Loss for trials.
He has, among other things, made advertising.
His work in the United States he describes as interesting, and also similar to Finland.
However, the work has to be done more hard, because the model work can always be replaced by a replacement.
You have to be stronger and aggressive, says Chafak.

The Danish police found the volvo searched in a massive operation: "We can't tell what"
The massive searches by the Danish police have resulted.
At the beginning of the operation, the traffic was closed at the bridges of Juutinrauma and Big Belt.
All land and ferry transportation from the island of Själlan was closed to Sweden, Germany and elsewhere in Denmark.
Police are searching for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
The Islamic State attacked the Copenhagen Police Media Center.
The car searched was found.
We can’t yet tell where the car was found, says Henrik Storm, a police officer in Copenhagen.
According to Storm, the searched Black Volvol has no direct contact with the threat.
He says the greatest danger is over.
The Danish woman Ekstra Bladet told the police on Saturday about the news event.
Investigative director Jørgen Bergen Skov was from the course of the vacuum surgery.
He did not know which criminal case was investigated.
However, Skov said it was a “serious crime.”
It was a threat to human lives.
Three people were searched for the operation.
The police don't know if they've been arrested.
According to the newspaper, shipping restrictions have been repealed.
The police also followed the incident on their Twitter account.
According to the police, the large public is no longer concerned because the threat was targeted to certain people.
The name of Macedonia has caused decades of distinction - now the people vote on it in disputed elections
In the Balkans, Macedonia is currently voting on the proposal for a new name.
According to the agreement between the Greek and Macedonian governments, the Republic of Macedonia will be called the Republic of Macedonia.
So far, Greece has blocked its veto to Makedonia’s efforts to become a member of the NATO and the EU.
According to Greece, the name Macedonia belongs to its northern province.
The question of the referendum is not to mention a new name, but to question whether the voter is in favour of Macedonia’s EU and NATO membership by approving the agreement.
The vote began online at least at a school in the center of the capital Skopje.
Pensionary nurse Olivera Argirosvka, who voted at school, hoped for the agreement.
A referendum means a change if it opens the doors to Europe and NATO.
This means a change especially for young people, he said.
In 1991, Macedonia became independent from the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
The government of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev has campaigned for the agreement.
The nationalist right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called for the referendum to be boycotted.
In addition to the result, it is exciting to see whether the voting rate will rise above the required 50 percent.
The referendum is not binding, but the victory of the yes votes would give the mandate to amend the Constitution.
An amendment to the Constitution requires a two-thirds majority of Parliament.
The Greek Parliament still has to approve the agreement.
The locations will be closed at 8 a.m. in the summer time.
A comedy victory!
Robert Helenius to Erkan Teper
Robert Helenius met Erkan Teper late Saturday afternoon in a professional boxing match in Germany.
A 34-year-old Finnish man took the measurement of his 36-year-old German opponent in Waldenbuch, Stuttgart.
The night's main match was the IBF's heavy series Intercontinental.

Helenius resolved the match in the eighth round, when he crushed Teper with a hard left hand.
He could no longer get up from the floor.
"Nordic Nightmare" hit its opponent in the third stage, when the German's nose began to flow blood.

Canada is fighting time to reach a deal with the U.S.
Time threatens to end the negotiations between the U.S. and Canada on the Free Trade Agreement.
The U.S. has set a backbone on Sunday, and the country’s negotiators have discussed closely during the weekend.
Canada's chief negotiator, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has delayed his speech at the UN General Assembly in order to focus on trade negotiations fully.
At the request of President Donald Trump, the United States, Canada and Mexico began negotiations about a year ago to reform the North American Free Trade Agreement.
In the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached an agreement, but a deal with Canada has not yet been reached.
The United States and Mexico are hoping to put the deal into force before the Mexican presidential election winner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador enters office in early December.
Trump has said that Canada’s participation in the deal is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that he plans to sign the deal at the end of November - whether Canada is involved or not.
Due to these schedules, the text of the agreement between the U.S. and Canada should be ready on Sunday so that the U.S. Congress has enough time to evaluate it.

Students show a rare sensation: an ancient tragedy - scattered Oresteia affects its visuality
Ancient tragedies are a rare taste in Finnish scenes.
For example, the National Theatre has seen the last ancient tragedy, Sofokleen Filoktetes, in 1988.
Now the Theatre High School brought to the tour starting with the National Theatre the only whole remaining theatrical trilogy of the ancient, Aiskhylos Oresteia.
In the Lava Open! projects launched in 2015, the Actor's students of the Theatre High School work together with a professional director internationally.
This fourth project, as well as the first, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
His first international evening was held in Berlin in April.
The agreement of Roha from Orestea accentuates the report of the end of the blood system of the tribe of Atreus, who was convicted of destruction, and the birth of the rule of law, thanks to an hour to twenty minutes, especially by accentuating the quarters.
The work succeeds to be very faithful to the spirit of Kirsti Simonsuru's fine finance (2003).
The dramatic lights and the theatre scene pages revealing the presentation emphasize the simplified and bright theatrical thinking.
It focuses on the dynamics between the exhibitors who turn away from the crossing, performing the nomination roles, and the crossing.
In the presentation, we use both the double and the third-party translator’s nominal roles.
The actors don’t leave the stage at all, so for example the murders of Agamemnoni and Kassandra, who returned from the War of Troy, are shown on the stage, unlike the tradition of the ancient show tradition.
Of course, the presentation does not emphasize that it is faithful to the ancient presentation tradition.
Instead, a modern, text-faithful interpretation is created in front of the spectator’s eyes, constantly aware of its ritual roots.
Roiha has managed to get the master's stage of acting students out as a tight group, directly as one organism, a rhythmic group that occurs.
Particularly in the coro parts, actors who tend to go to very expressive, sculptural group shapes can access their rights by the naked, only by decorating a white front flag, on the screen.
and impressive.
The show tour continues to the Kouvolan and Oulun Theatre.

Nurses fled several times in Cayenne
A little over thirty-year-old man harassed three men in a restaurant in the center of Cayenne and in front of it on Saturday morning.
The man first hit one man inside a restaurant, which resulted in him being removed from the place.
Outside he would throw another man into the land, and in the absence of the third man in the situation, the misleader still hit him as well.
Police arrested the abuser.
At the police station, the man continued to behave aggressively and threw another police officer to the foot.
He also threatened the police with abuse and murder.
The man was brought to the tube to calm.
The case is investigated in three forms of harassment and violent opposition to the official.
In the centre of Kajaan, a second misconduct occurred on Saturday morning.
The victim was harassed by two men.
A 20-year-old man hit the victim.
A little later another man threw him into the ground and the previously hit man still threw the victim.
The outsiders pulled the offenders away from the victim and the police were called to the place.
The victims had to leave before the police arrived.
The police ask the observers of the incident to contact the Kajaan police by telephone 0295 416 520 or by email at investigation@kainuu@poliisi.fi.
Radio broadcaster Erkki Pälli has died.
Erkki Pälli, a long-term journalist, died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio broadcaster Erkki Pälli, 83, has died.
She died of unhealing liver cancer, which she on her Facebook page in March 2018.
This is going now.
The doctor has also said that I live day by day, he commented on his situation to Iltalehd a month ago.
The safety of the stores and stores must be guaranteed.
I received a remuneration for the first time in 1984.
When some of these stories get surprised, it’s usually a big news.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27.9.) about the uncertainty of retail workers, I was surprised and at a moment even slightly angry.
I also spoke about the work environment expert Erika Kähärää of the Service Areas Professionals Association (PAM).
He says the criminal statistics do not tell the real situation.
The problem is growing, although employers of course claim differently.
Police are informed only of cases that are clearly considered serious and many of the real violence cases are not.
“Enterprises have the obligation to statistic their situation on the basis of the Labour Safety Act, but these statistics will remain in internal use and their data will not be collected anywhere,” he said.
Mental injuries are not included in statistics.
In cases of violence, there has always been the problem that they do not always cause physical injuries.
However, mental trauma can be much more severe than muscles and wounds.
The difference between a situation of violence and a situation of threatening violence is difficult to draw when a certain level of aggressive threat must also be regarded as a situation of violence – even if it is not possible to do so.
Too many people are afraid of their workplace, even if the real act does not happen.
Some residential areas are unrestful.
The company has got guards.
At the time of the opening hours of the stores was released, the media also showed a great damp of its effects on the safety of the sellers.
“At that time many employers organized guard services at least for night hours as well as to prevent working alone,” Kähärä commented.
When nothing happens, we make a wrong conclusion.
This seems to have an effective effect now, but this generates a new negative trend.
When, due to the vigilance, the disorders remained well under control, the idea was that the vigilance would be unnecessary.
Now many places are trying to look for solutions that could remove expensive guard services.
A mild abuse is a criminal offence, and it is quite understood that the seller who has been abused does not want to make an investigation request for a criminal, who usually lives in a trade dealer.
But according to the same paragraph of the law set in 2011, mild abuse becomes subject to the prosecutor if it occurs at the workplace.
I need prejudices now.
When the next time a trade uncle or uncle is abused, the police should investigate and the prosecutor accuse.
If the court puts a few offenders in jail, and the judgment goes from there to the severe punishment, the practices will be cleaned.
A society in which the food trade must be open at small locations all night and day, must ensure the safety of the trade workers.
Heidi Sohlberg quoted Miss before the direct broadcast - "Sara, Ireland is then married"
This year, the crown will not be seen in the traditional way on TV, but the broadcast will be shown on the Viafree website.

There are many interesting matches followed by the previous years of Miss Finland.
Among other things, Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi sat next and Sohlberg threw a little joke in one direction.
Sara, Ireland is married!
Sohlberg was going to go to Saros.
Sohlberg most likely referred to the just divorced Siepp, who laughed at the comment, though it seemed confused at first.
She talked about her divorce for the first time in the week-end newspaper.
Missikaunotar said he didn’t want to open the reasons for the difference in detail in the public because it’s the matter between him and Roope Salmisen.
She said she didn’t have a hurry for a new relationship, but she intends to focus on herself.
I’m focusing on my own stories and especially I’m going to live my own life alone, Sara Sieppi said.
Harjula's marriage status came to light even later when Sohlberg accidentally mistaken to call Janni Hussia and Iiro Harjula a couple.
The triangle laughed.
Is it married or how did it go?
Janni Hussi cuts the mouth.

Philippine inventor flies with a drone car - how to avoid traffic breaks
Mendiola is a Philippine inventor, hip-hop dancer and some kind of Pelle Peloton.
He now belongs to a growing group in the world who swears to have invented a flying car – or at least his own version of it.
As competitors, he has such factors as Audi and Airbus.
However, Mendiola does not believe in its equipment in mass production.
According to reports from the world, the man has spent a large part of his wealth to build his dream.
He started developing his flying car six years ago.
Now he calls the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says he did his first successful test flight - he flown with his device at a height of more than seven meters.
One of his objectives was to avoid traffic breaks.
I hope the device will trigger positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago, Mendiola said, according to the British Daily Mail.
JHL predicts: Tomorrow starts work fighting activities will appear in children’s day care and social and health services
In the public and well-being sectors tomorrow starts the ban on overwork and exchange will be seen especially in social and health services as well as in children’s day care, assesses JHL’s chairman Päivi Niemi-Laine.
The effects will be broad, and they will surely appear in a way that there is not enough staff on the site.
Everyone has to think about how they are looking for their children.
The task of the employer is now to take care that the services are playing and that no one’s lives are threatened, Niemi-Laine says to STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the lack of workers was also visible at the beginning of the year, when members of JHL were banned from overworking and exchanging due to contractual negotiations.
Through the flexibility, employers have made it possible that the staff has not been hired, but that the workers have remained overworked or changed jobs.
This is not a labor struggle.
In terms of labor protection, it is a norm that every employee is concerned about regular working hours and only they are done.
JHL opposes the government’s intentions to relieve the dismissal protection of small.
Municipal employers’ labour market director Markku Jalonen will not take a pre-evaluation of the effects of overwork and exchange prohibitions.
However, he does not believe that they are very variable, although the services may be weakened.
Employers around Finland are aware of this and have done the preparations that are to be done.
The area is so unlikely wide, the social and health sector and the technical sector that it’s hard to say.
The effects can vary very much by industry, region and employer, Jalonen told STT.
Jalonen says that last week we have already obtained experience, among other things, of the Neighborhood and Basic Care Association Super and the Social and Health Professional Organization Tehy’s equivalent, three-day activities.
Their effects were quite small.
The JHL’s ban on overwork and exchange applies, among other things, to workers in municipalities, churches, state and private social and health sectors.
For example, family day careers are limited outside.
The labor struggle concerns almost 100,000 members of the JHL at this stage.
According to Niemi-Laine, the actions of JHL may take a long time.
The association has also prepared for other labor fighting activities if the preparation of the dismissal law continues.
The government should now admit that here we run to the wall and hard.
He said that both the Ay movement and the government should be opposed.
It is special here that the hards are already in the chip, although the presentation has not yet been given, Jalonen is updating.
The Great Corallyrity is created by the power of children and adults - in the gyms of the presentation, the gestures of the grace and the marine are studied
In other premises, the Collective Great Coralry received its first evening last spring in Hamburg and last Saturday it was presented for the second time in Finland, this time in the Kanneltal.
Like the previous works of the group, The Great Coral is a work that is built from the beginning to the end together with the audience.
This time, however, a clearer presentation will also be built, which will refresh and crystallize the observations made in the initial exercises.
There is a lot of magic for the children’s theater.
The child’s perspective has already been taken into account in the preparatory stage of the work.
The Great Coral Race is not a children's show but a show that adults and children do in collaboration.
It gives adults information and insights about the way children receive information and do art.
The ability of children to throw into exercised and joint games also relieves the distance between adults and children.
The Great Coral Race resembles some of the satubalets, the gyms, and the awareness of nature, but ultimately it flows around visits in different, non-human circumstances.
The Great Coral Race begins with the experience of the corals and the trade routes of bodies and fish living on the Coral Race.
Six different gyms teach, among other things, the gestures of wrath and marine.
Finally, a less than an hour show will be held, where music, lights and bright paintings and clothes will help you get acquainted with the life of the coral.
In the Great Coral Ride, there are both submarine people who observe the life of the Coral Ride and the corals that are observed.
There are also coral-looking organisms.
The sights and observations directed in various directions make the presentation thick and life-forming.
Whether it is the landscape of a creature, the creature that looks at the landscape, and the other creature or landscape that looks at the creature, and all this at the same time.
It does not seem difficult for children.
In other spaces, the group strives to reach the boundary of thought and action, which is challenging to reach when the group consists of both children and adults.
On the other hand, the involvement of children makes it more important.
After the working hours, a silent demonstration will be held at Sitrator on behalf of the corals threatened.
The destruction that exceeds human understanding should not be forgiven, even though it might be difficult to understand what the meaning of exercising your own compassion is now in the face of the destruction.
In other premises, he has built his work in such a way that he respects the diversity of life also through political gestures.
There are also other generations, there are different kinds of consciousness, other species and their future generations, whose wonder and play it rains the space.
Children grow up too quickly - I'm happy that in my childhood there were no smartphones
Today’s children and young people are becoming more and more unresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking as younger and younger.
I think children should be children throughout their childhood, and don’t disturb their lives because of sex, because others say they’re doing so.
I was angry when my boyfriend told me that he had to pick up his fifth-class sister for a weekend from the "chief".
When she came to search for her humiliated sister, this told her sex experiences that evening.
I could no way imagine my own sister in the same situation, because we have been told and warned throughout our childhood that it is not to be touched by spots and that sex is a matter of adults.
I hope that modern children will be able to live a decent childhood, and they will not need to grow up too early because of the group pressure created by friends.
I constantly see on Instagram more and more young girls who are on their image makeup and reveal clothes on them.
Snapchat is used to take and send disclosing images in the evening.
It is more difficult for the girls to figure out what age they are.
Modern 13-year-olds can easily look like 18-year-olds and parents as well.
My childhood consisted of playing in the forest and playing table games.
I’m glad I didn’t have a smartphone in my childhood.
I have been a child for many years, and I didn’t have to think about what others think about me.
General: Authorities told state leadership that the Airiston Helmi case is not related to national security
Ilkka Kanerva, who interviewed Ylen, said the Defence Police and Defence Forces had been informing the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committee earlier this week.
The Finnish state leadership has been informed that the Airiston Helme investigation is currently not related to national security, but to organized crime.
The information was confirmed by Ylelle Defence Committee Chairman Ilkka Kanerva (kok).
According to Kanerva, the Defence Forces and the Defence Police have visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committee this week to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is primarily considered economic crime.
They were quite strict about not speculating that there would be anything else here, Kanerva commented on Yle in an interview.
According to the data, there has not been any evidence of a connection to national security from the material captured, but the investigation is only in place.
We can’t know anything else about what can be revealed from there, one of the top interviewers says.
A week ago, large-scale home searches on the island of Turun and the continent have raised the question of whether the investigation is merely an economic crime or a threat to Finnish internal security.
Earlier this week, the news agency discussed an issue that was discussed both for and against.
Video: Dream painting saved Liverpool's defeated series
Liverpool's hundred-percent Premier League start came to an end, but it was still a more satisfied team with the 1-1 match at Stamford Bridg.
On Sunday, the same year has passed since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and escaped 1-0 victory.
Then Pep Guardiola's combination sent a signal to the entire League that City was now serious.
Everyone knows how the season ended.
And Liverpool manager Jûrgen Klopp arrived in West London with the same idea.
The Red League started with six consecutive victories.
Liverpool started stronger and especially Virgil van Dijk seemed to dominate his own field end alone.
Chelsea, on the other hand, had a fine League Cup guest victory on Anfield Road on Wednesday.
Then Eden Hazard rose out of the exchange bank to resolve the match with a stunning individual performance.
Now, of course, Hazard has been with them right from the beginning.
In the 25th minute, he first played in a small space in a triumph with Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
Finally, the Croatian saw Hazard go ahead and sent him a perfectly emphasized pass.
Hazard walked a little to the penalty area, but bombed the perfect left foot to the back-wall.
Alisson was a little slow in his fight and only got his finger to the ball.
Klopp felt the defeat position slightly unfair, as almost immediately after Antonio Rüdiger dropped Mo Salah's direction's painting power.
In the second season, Chelsea's boss Kepa also came into real action.
The baskivahti quickly responded to Sadio Mané's petition and pushed the ball from the row to the corner.
On the other hand, Alisson scored zero on Hazard's pass.
The best place for guests came in the 72nd minute when James Milner found Bobby Firmino.
However, the brassstar's bowl was directed to the country team captain David Luizia, who saved the host's leadership.
In the 89th minute, Daniel Sturridge was able to freely shoot from 25 meters.
Sturridge played in his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed it in honor of the upper corner of the unresistible bet.
Liverpool's 100 percent league start ended with a 1-1 match, but it's still in the league crash - together with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also strictly involved in the championship with two points behind the top.
The clocks are deep.
I remember when a few decades ago a newspaper asked different Finnish influencers what divides the Finnish people.
The only answer was left in mind: the decision.
Some people have a nonsense and some do not.
It can be found anywhere, and there was one offer.
In the EU, Finland has given a time to abandon the annual clock shift.
A lot of people agree that clock transfer twice a year has been the job of the fools and has caused a variety of problems.
Finally, this achievement seems to be at least the easiest step of the solution in Finland, although it has not been easy at all.
The most difficult is now to decide what time you will finally end: the current summer or winter time or any other time zone.
It is also possible for people to express their opinion on the website.fi.
The survey was opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and will be open until Friday, October 12.
The discussion is hard on the coffee tables and on social media, and everyone has his own word to say.
The defenders of winter time argue their attitude by the influence of morning light on the well-being of people, and the summer time by the influence of evening light on the desire of people to the outside and thus on the well-being.
Both sides have strong supporters and good reasons.
The research also suggests that morning light brings the rhythm of the day and gives humankind.
On the other hand, if you don’t suffer from awakening in the dark, the brightness increases the movement of people out and gives better opportunities for, for example, autumn mountains.
The amount of extra light after a normal working day has already been calculated to the hour.
I would prefer to take both, but badly for our location in the northern coast of the earth we can't do anything.
The winter is too dark and the summer is too bright for many in any case.
A typical discussion on a topic is that one’s own view is driven and the other’s view is very strongly opposed.
The reasoning of the opposite party is hardly listening, because the most important thing is how the matter feels about itself.
Because almost everyone finds an opinion about this, it’s somewhat useless to try to turn the other head.
This is where the food is lost.
The subject is terribly easy to discuss, because the matter does not require a great deal of discouragement and there is enough mutual knowledge to justify it.
Similar matters are generally discussed more rigorously and unfruitfully.
I'm sorry if you're choosing the wrong option, but you're probably adapting to it.
And always it also offers a suitable sintipuk if life feels apple.
Josba fought the star's guest victory
Josba's first guest game in the Divar of the salibandy produced three full series points against Nurmo Jymy.
Josba left the walls for home trip with a pleasant 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory.
Nurmo was still leading the painting at the beginning of the third part, but Josba sought compositions and recycled men in the chains.
At the time of 50.47, the brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtinemi played the 6-5 winning medal.
The two teams played a crucial minute in the match.
The most powerful was Juuso Lehtinemi (2+1).
The double chain was flooding otherwise, when Teemu Tuhkanen (1+1), Jere Kartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also hit.
Miika Kosonenkin (1+0) played his goal at the time of birth also in the double chain.
Joshua has six points after three series rounds.
The next opponent will be O2-Jyväskylä guests in two weeks.
200th Anniversary Celebration on Sunday
The 200th anniversary of the Enon Church will be celebrated tomorrow on Sunday in a partially sad atmosphere.
The burning of the church a week ago was a shock.
The church was guarded for two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, today is still the place of the celebration.
Although no one would like that, the Eno Church is now the oldest church of the Joensuu congregation.
The church on the mountain in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Eno despite all the municipalities and other associations in the world.
The family ceremony begins in the Enon church today at 10 p.m.
After that, we move to the church house to the border of the bear table.
The program has all kinds of things throughout the day both inside and outside.
For example, the church building can be consulted by Ari Räsäsen, who was retired and worked as a church master for 37 years.
The church’s birthday is also the end of one era.
The church house built in 1982 has its doors open today for the last time.
Now we are in the displacement premises in the former municipality, says the captain Markku Koistinen.
The church was destroyed by internal air problems, but the church has remained healthy for 200 years.
Elon Musk resigns from Tesla's presidential office: $40 million accusations were agreed
The electric car manufacturer Tesla and CEO Elon Musk have agreed their legal relations with the US Securities Authority (SEC).
The SEC suspected Musk was guilty of a debt, and Musk was at risk of being dismissed due to the company he founded.
Musk will continue to be CEO of Tesla.
Instead, Musk will be forced to resign from the chairman of Tesla for three years.
The company will have to hire a chairman of the external government.
Musk is also under stricter control.
According to the agreement, Tesla has to hire two independent leaders and further monitor Musk’s communication.
In addition, Tesla and Musk will pay both $20 million (approximately €17 million) to settle the case.
“The decision is intended to prevent new market disturbances and the disadvantages for Tesla’s shareholders,” said CEO Steven Peikin of SEC.
The case began in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he could withdraw the company from the stock exchange.
Musk also wrote that the company’s funding is secured.
The tweet immediately raised Tesla’s stock exchange rate.
The SEC suspected Musk was guilty of securities.
According to the agency, the quotation was false and misleading, and Musk had not talked about the arrangement with the company’s other management or potential funders.
In practice, the agency accused Musk of misleading investors.
SEC announced on Friday that it will challenge the company and Musk's court.
The SEC has claimed that Musk will be sentenced to fines and prohibited from operating under the leadership of stock companies.
SEC's challenge shocked investors, and Tesla's shares went to a strong decline.
More than 800 people killed in Indonesian earthquake and tsunami
The number of people killed in the Indonesian earthquake and the subsequent tsunami has risen to at least 832 people, the country’s disaster agency reports AFP.
The number of deaths is expected to continue to increase, as the disaster is underway.
Vice-President Giuseppe Kalla said the final number could rise to thousands.
The earthquake on Friday caused a tsunami that benefited the city of Palou on the island of Sulawes.
A tsunami warning was issued immediately after the earthquake, which was quickly cancelled.
According to the authorities, almost all of the dead are known at least so far.
The rescue authorities are concerned, among other things, near the center of the earthquake in the Donggala area, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Many people are already known to have died.
Request for assistance
The Indonesian army has been warned to help rescue workers search for the victims.
President Joko Widodon, who arrived in the district today, urged the soldiers to continue the rescue work without exhausting day and night.
One of the centers of the rescue work is the Palua hotel, which is believed to have 50-60 people in its ruins.
The head of the rescue agency, Muhammad Syaugi, said that one man was killed in the ruins of the hotel Roa-Roa, a business tourist’s favourite hotel.
We also heard people’s calls for help, he said.
According to Syaug, heavy rape equipment would be quickly mined in the earthquake and tsunami area.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their missing relatives.
Help you in and nearby.
My friend's family members are still missing, one writer attracted a Facebook group.
Police's telephone numbers fall into the hands of terrorists in Britain
Many British politicians were tortured when their contact information was broken out due to the failures in encrypting the app.
The incident occurred, among other things, on the phone numbers of the ministers.
This was the application used by the British Conservative Party in the government.
For example, the environment, nutrition and rural ministry Michael Gove and former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson were subjected to harassment.
A number of people received disturbances.
Due to the lack of encryption of the app, the public had access to the profile of politicians who were in the mobile app of the Conservative Party’s Annual Meeting.
The public had access to the profiles using the politician’s email address. which was easily accessible online.
The user logged in to view and modify the material stored in the profile.
Someone managed to change for a moment Boris Johnson's profile picture to a porn picture and title insulting.
The profile picture of Michael Goven was replaced by the media photographer Rupert Murdoch.
The Guardian columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting app allows you to log in to other people’s profiles with these email addresses.
Then the logger can view the profile person’s contact details and, for example, send messages in this name.
The meeting app made the telephone number of each journalist, politician and participant public, Foster criticized.
A member of the Conservative Party apologized for the lack of information.
He said the technical problems have been solved and the application is now working safely.
The British Data Authority, ICO, supports data fraud.
The application was developed by the Australian company Crown Comms.
The opposition’s Labour Party criticises that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted in security matters.
Every week there is a large number of Polish killers in the Wall Finland tour.
The attentive viewers attracted attention to the reactions of the studio audience of the Wall Finland show program.
The worldwide rapidly spread U.S. format The Wall landed in the Finnish version for the Fourth last Saturday.
The game show hosted by Heikki Pasosen is described in the same studio in Poland, where the format of other international productions is made.
In the Polish studio, the possibilities of recording were exceptional, as the large 12 meters tall game walls of the format demanded space.
During the initial period, the social media showed the studio audience of the program, which was promoted as Polish.
On Twitter, there was a discussion about whether the Poles may be sitting in the studio about the game playing in Finnish.
The master of four domestic programs Unne Sormunen illuminates the matter to Iltalehd.
He tells us that the studio audience has close players, other Finnish, foreign Finnish living in Poland, and just but Polish viewers.
The audience consists of international taputers in Finnish production, just like the audience of the The Wall periods that are described in the same production state in other countries.
In Finland, there are also such groups, so-called professional audiences, who go to the descriptions of different programs, the ring is backward.
He reminds that following the game in itself is not so difficult, even if he does not understand the language in which it is played.
Red and green balls falling from the wall can be easily distinguished.
However, for guest languages in the studio there are interpreters who manage the translation work.
There are two interpreters who interpret as a simultaneous interpretation to the studio director throughout the events.
And the studio director then guides the audience and tells us what kind of foam there is throwed and what the situation is going on, Sormunen says.
He compares the situation to how David Hasselhoff was handled back in domestic production.
David Hasselhoff was a few years ago involved in Talent Finland’s descriptions at us in Finland.
He had a simultan interpretation in his ears, and he knew everything that was spoken in Finnish, the sum of the ring.
Japan's south-eastern Taifun is moving towards the main islands - authorities warn of flooding and earthquakes
The authorities are also warning of possible earthquakes and floods.
At least 50 people have been injured in the Taifun Tram, but the authorities say serious injuries have been avoided and the deaths have not yet been.
On the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so strong that it has turned cars around.
According to the NHK broadcasting company, people have been evacuated to the guards, and electricity has been cut off from more than 300,000 households.
More than a thousand flights have been canceled and cruise trains are stopping due to the storm.
The storm is expected to hit Osaka near half-day time in Finland.
The capital Tokyo is not directly on the storm route, but it is also allowed to have heavy winds and rains.
The train has been canceled today in Tokyo.
According to scientists, Trami will fight Japan until Monday.
The heavens are still shining.
The first season was bad.
Heaven was already almost dark when the team lost on Saturday at home for Vasa Sport by counting 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1).
The players now have five consecutive losses, and points for six rounds are in a total of two.
None of the Defenders of the Axis or two players in the lower chain have yet painted.
The pressure is also increasing.
At the end of the game, all of the players have been able to play at the end of the game, when half of the game is left.
Six games are just played, and there is no reason to give up here.
We have to be worried because we played very badly.
Especially the second part’s presentation was disappointingly bad, the effects of 1+2 made by Jarno Kärki said.
The victory naturally tasted.
The team was down the game on Friday, so it would have been thought to appear in the match.
It might be clear, but it could not be used.
The number of visitors continued to increase.
The Mother of the Bread Day Pirkko Hyvärinen wondered when watching the large hall the audience of the event.
Somehow I thought that maybe not so many people will come this year, Hyvärinen thinks in the morning.
In autumn 2017 at the same time with the Bread Day, the Traktorkynn SM competitions were held, so the expectations would be that the audience could even slightly decrease from the previous year.
However, the opposite happened; the corridors were closed sharply before ten, the sellers said the products were over, the newsboard was sold more than before by 500 portions, and the number of cars even Hyvärinen heard a rise.
The number of visitors is estimated to be approximately 6,000, Hyvärinen says later in the afternoon.
In the morning and in the afternoon at 5 p.m. there was a lot of program for children’s families, which would attract them to a record number of places.
In addition, Hyvärinen estimates that the event will go further.
Also, sellers flee to Liper every year from a larger area.
This year, reporters, craftsmen, bread and crops sellers had arrived at their breadmakers almost a hundred.
The mother of the Bread Day PIrkko Hyvärinen loved the audience of the hall viewing.
At the beginning of the bread day, a hundred were blessed.
In the children's series Teija Kiviniemen's beautiful bread won the public vote.
The children’s bread competition included 11 different forms of bread.
The winner of the rice bread competition, Marjatta Vepsäläinen, spent the day in the martes' draw.
7 x the most beautiful lights - this is how you recognize a good lamp
Wake up the room for life, create the right atmosphere for the decoration and read the book of your eyes without tired.
Good lighting is worth paying.
We gathered together three good reasons to invest in lighting.
The award was awarded by Innolux’s sales and marketing director Tarja Jokiniemi.
Make service to your eyes.
The importance of lighting increases, the more ages are behind.
A sufficient light can help with the problems that many people face with age, when vision accuracy decreases and more and more people suffer from turmoil.
The need for light is also increasing.
Sixteen people need three times more light than twenty.
Therefore, the treatment effects of light and the properties of the lighting should be considered for health reasons.
A good lighting gives enough light, but it doesn’t shake, Jokiniem suggests.
Create beauty around you.
A beautiful interior can only be found with the right lighting solutions.
In this moment, the owner has the right to choose.
There is a popular Japanese style that combines scandinavian and Japanese.
On the other hand, the modern and playful retrotyle, inspired by the 1970s, with strong colors, different tones of metal or ice cream colors, has risen to boom.
The authenticity fascinates the same way as in the other interior of the house.
Materials are now displayed in wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Showing your personality
On the other hand, the house is now invested more than before, and the decoration has become a way to express itself.
Instead of mass production, we want to go to our own home with a customized, courageous lighting that has a story to tell.
People are clearly searching for Finnish and Nordic products whose origin and designer are known.
So let’s be very design-conscious, says Jokiniemi.
At home, you may not necessarily buy the latest trend lighting, but an untemporary classic, for which it has been saved for many years.
Certain kinds of unthinkable, elegant and elegant classics keep their surface from year to year, Jokiniemi says.
Thank you and see!
KooKoo showed the door to a Canadian attacker after three games
The roads of KooKoon and the attacker Brendan O'Donnell are disappearing.
The Canadian attacker played a total of three league matches in the Orange Simmons without efficiency points, KooKoo said in a statement.
O'Donnell moved to KooCo in August with a one-year contract, which included a test period that lasted by the end of September.
Last season, the 26-year-old attacker played at KHL at Kunlund Red Star and at KHL’s farm at VHL at KRS Heilongjiang.
O'Donnell's new team is not yet known.
The player wants to show an example in recycling - the goods go to the world in recycling locks, the plastic turns into paper
The specialty of games is currently recycling, not only games, but also packaging materials.
The products of the customers of the stone store are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made of recycling material.
Products ordered from the online store are packed, for example, in packaging from importers.
All the packages that come to us will be reused.
We can use the boxes a dozen times, as long as the package is in a state that it can be used, says Ville Puurula Oulun of the Player.
As a moisture material, the company generally uses newspapers and other similar recycling materials.
Butterflies are avoided as far as possible.
In the near future, we are going to move on to recycling materials as well.
He wants to be an example for others as well.
Recycling does not cause any extra effort.
There is no big problem to start recycling.
This will also generate financial savings when, for example, new packages are used.
Recycling is naturally suitable for the Player’s activity, as, in addition to new products, the main product range of the movement includes, among other things, the used games and equipment.
Every fashion-conscious purchase: One and the same shirt works in every apartment
Classical clothes work from season to season in the living than in the living.
In their diversity, they create the foundation of a good garderobe, because around high-quality classics, it is easy to gather different houses at a low cost.
In the autumn, the most common classics used in the clothing cabin are high-quality needles.
This category also includes the black side.
The black needle made of natural material with pool shells may not have a mistake.
The clothes can be combined with both straight pants, thin butter as well as garments, and around it can be created both a smooth residential whole and a rough style.
The Pooloneule is suitable for both young modern clothes and classical sophisticated style tourists.
This is how you create style.
The autumn trend variety arises from golden-growing and wide-range stand-alone clothes, black pooloneule, and gray nils.
The classic pooloneule, together with other classics, the blue-green Scottish grapes and wine-red loafers, form a female and sophisticated residential community.
Bring the black pooloneule brush by combining it with the trendy clothes of the reno: garbage, high socks, and thick shoes.
Young and elegant!
Russian intelligence sabotage has a long tradition.
There is no reason to assume that the foreign delegation of the Russian Federation SVR or the military delegation GRU would have renounced this approach.
During the Soviet Union, so-called DRG groups specialized in sabotage activities.
The name comes from the Russian word diversionno-razvedyvatelnaja gruppa: sabotage and intelligence group.
The representatives of the Soviet Security Service’s KGB’s western countries are preparing detailed plans for important sabotage points, says KGB’s archiver Vasili Mitrohin (1922-2004).
His information was published in Christopher Andrew's books in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
The objects included ports, slopes, large slopes, oil processors and gas pipeline connections.
In Germany, the KGB purchased to the DRG groups uniforms and equipment from the Bundeswehr, railways, rescue guards and staff for cover operations.
This trick was used by Russian landing warriors in the Crimea in February 2014: they dressed in local Ukrainian police’s roofing equipment, established inspection stations for the roads leading from the peninsula to Ukraine, and isolated Crimea from their homeland.
At the time of the Cold War, the agents hid sabotage groups in the ground packages of supplies containing mines, explosives, flammers and communications.
In 1998 the KGB’s hiding was discovered in Switzerland, whose anthaminium exploded when the authorities sprayed it with water flowers.
Police arrested four roads in the village.
Police arrested four roadside drinks across the North Karjala between Friday and Saturday night.
In the river, a 18-year-old man with a container flammed 1.57 promiles.
He was driving at half a four in the night at the start of the Cajaaninties in his mouth with two passengers.
The car broke down at four in the night, and a 19-year-old man alone in the car, according to the police, broke 1.54 promiles.
He did not suffer serious injuries.
In the centre of Outokummu, a 20-year-old outdoors man who was driving a person's car hit a 1.33 promile in the alcometer.
Police suspect those male drivers of a severe drunk and the driver of the Polvijärve in addition to a threat to road safety.
On Saturday morning, a 36-year-old man who carried a local package car on the crossroads of the Öllöläntien and Hoikantien in Tuupovaara flammed 0.52 promiles.
He is suspected of drunk.
The police are asking for information about the woods that occurred at the train station after midnight.
According to the police, the man was abused on a parking place in front of the station with life-threatening consequences.
It was recorded on the monitoring camera.
The suspects dressed in dark pants and brown or beige jackets disappeared immediately after the shooting with a dark farmer car to the Ratapihankatua bus station.
One suspect dropped on a bicycle to the centre.
A pedestrian died frozen under a bus
A pedestrian died early on Saturday morning when a bus crashed with him.
The accident occurred after the morning in the area.
The bus driver is not suspicious of the crime.
Police are investigating the events that led to the accident.
The U.S. has ended the test period and the risk period has ended.
Mika Toivola, sporting director of Hämeenlinnan HPK, says that Filip Riska (central) has been important for the team in the initiative, underpower play and the defensive role of the fourth field.
At the beginning of the season, Filip Riska will continue to play at Hämeenlinnan HPK in the end of the month.
Experienced Risk, 33, success in the roles offered to him convinced the accompanying leadership.
Philip has been important to us in the start, in the sub-power game and in the defense role of the four-field.
Although there is still something to improve, the young team is good to keep up with such an experienced player, HPK’s sports manager Mika Toivola commented in the team’s statement.
Hopefully, the value of the risk will rise when playing the Hockey League solution games.
The central attacker from St. Petersburg, Riska, has previously played league championship in JYP, Luko and Sport.
Instead, the law enemy Oskari Lehtinen remained without a contract after the trial period.

Everest gets its first night on TV.
In May 1996, a devastating snowstorm surprised climbers on Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormákur's 2015 directory tells us about the survival struggle that has been dealt with in the grain.
There have been films and documentaries about the tragedy before.
These events are also happening in this area.
The highest mountain in the world killed eight climbers 22 years ago.
Two of them were experienced excursion leaders: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
Hall was the guide of Weathers.
Weathers' life could have been saved by an eye surgery before his departure to Nepal.
As a result of it and the air pressure, he lost sight, which was why the capture of the peak had to be left between.
Rob Hall continued his journey and never returned.
Weathers’ struggle for life and death has just begun.
When the storm raised, he lost and no longer found him back in the camp.
When the man was searched, he was found in such a bad condition that he was not believed to survive.
Weathers was left to death.
As a miracle, however, he went to his feet and found others.
The badly burned Weathers was thought to continue to die, and again he was left to his own luck.
It is clear that contrary to different expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, the counterparts also began to believe in the possibility that he was given help.

The Mediterranean hurricane is called the Zorba.
The Greek Institute of Meteorology has issued a red weather warning to the regions of Attica, Peloponnesus, the Ionian Islands, Cyclades and Crete.

It is a cool, but beautiful summer with a romantic taste.
A strong and slightly retro-minded residential collection is derived from a long rubber-gray steam, overpowered steam, outlooking earbrushes, and a thread-long coat.
Though overpowered ointments have a certain sofistication, they are perfectly suited for a relaxed daywear along with a t-shirt, long shorts, and a trendy flagship.
So easy and still so stylish!
Two Robot Vehicles Begin to Drive in Espo
They travel during the end of the year and take on passengers, the city of Espoo informs.
Otaniem’s robotic cars will play the role of a bus simulator, as next spring the area is scheduled to start traffic with a robotic bus.
The project will develop and pilot robotic vehicle traffic that works throughout the year and test the technical functionality of vehicles under the Finnish conditions.
In the experiment, we will find out how robots work with the current street network.
At the same time, the city provides robotic bus developers with the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment, says traffic management manager Johanna Nyberg.
For the first time, robots run completely automatically among the other traffic without any specific traffic arrangements.
The safety of the vehicle is always responsible for the assistant passenger.
Vehicles are constantly sensing their environment with a number of different sensors and assessing whether the driveway is free.
If not, they will explain whether a vehicle, bicycle or snowfall has been detected, says Harri Santamala, CEO of Sensible 4, responsible for the development of robotic traffic.
Robot cars run all autumn three days a week: Tuesday at 13-15.30, Wednesday at 10-15 and Thursday at 10-15.
Robot cars stop at six stops along the route and take passengers to the car.
The stops of the robots identify the stops.
You will be able to get to the station number 1 in Otaka.

Police watched the hunting in North Karjala and Savos
The police department of Eastern Finland carried out hunting surveillance on Friday and Saturday with the Forest Government and the Finnish deprivation center in North Karjal and Ylä-Savos, police department deprivation personnel on Saturday in social media.

Mykänen goes to Turkey to follow the selection of Syrian quota refugees
In the coming days, Interior Minister Kai Mykkänen will travel to Turkey to follow the selection of quota refugees coming to Finland.
Finland has decided to take 530 Syrian refugees from the Turkish refugee camps to Finland this year.
The selection trips are usually made a couple of times a year, with representatives from the Immigration Agency, the Ministry of Labour and Commerce and the police.
The delegation is currently conducting interviews in Turkey.
The United Nations Refugee Organization (UNHCR) is the first member of the United Nations Refugee Organization (UNHCR) to select people with a particular vulnerability.
In practice, it refers to people who are considered to be in a special emergency situation in refugee camps, such as single-care families, disabled and sick, women and children.
In Finland, there are more people to be selected than there is in the quota, because in practice a part remains untouched for different reasons.
Mykänen will also meet with the Turkish Minister of Internal Affairs Süleyman Soylu and NGOs operating on the border with Syria.
The tour is also attended by the Minister of Internal Affairs, Ilkka Salmi.
The Quota Increase
Finland has accepted quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
The quota was 1050 per year for a couple of years, but there has not been any agreement with the government to raise it.
The assembly has supported the quota rise, but the project has last fallen to the resistance of the blue.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä recently proposed to gradually raise the quota per 1 500-2 000 people per year.
The visit to Mykkas is the first in this government period that the Minister of the Interior takes place to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
Former Interior Ministers Petteri Orpo (kok.) and Paula Risikko (kok.) agreed to move to their new duties before the visits were organized.
Finland receives €10,000 aid from the EU for every refugee in a particular vulnerability.
Now we go to searches - no longer know, cry or laugh
On Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs announced a proposal to amend the Animal Protection Act.
The article came to the view that the draft law in principle prohibits the holding of any such animals as productive animals, pets or otherwise related to business activities which are not separately permitted by ministerial regulations.
Therefore, everything else is essentially prohibited except the animals specified separately in the regulation.
If the bill ends in law, it means that we are rejecting in Western democracies the general principle that the law separately prohibits activities that threaten the security of society or the good way.
In principle, the prohibition of any activity to which the law or regulation does not allow separately.
The change leads to the fact that nothing new can be tried, for example, in the business, and nothing else can be done before the law or regulation that approves it has been adopted.
The government’s work in legislation is generally poor.
If we now go on the way that in principle in Finland everything is prohibited, what is not permitted separately, you no longer know, cry or laugh.
There is no doubt that the Animal Protection Act will require an update.
But this legislation does not belong to democracy.
Unfortunately, I don’t know the Constitution very well, but can it accept such a procedure “all is prohibited, which is not permitted by law or regulation separately”.
I hope there will be a reasonable minister who will stop the progress of such a bill.

Kimi Räikkönen says Mercedes is better than Ferrari
Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen had to admit that the worst competitor Mercedes was too hard at the time of the Russian GP.
However, there is no reason to panic in the Ferrari camp, an experienced driver assesses.
They were just faster than us, but it is not a big thing.
Our car was time-time the best for the whole weekend so far, but they were just too fast, fourth driving and with his colleague Sebastian Vettel clearly left from the Mercedes speed, Räikkönen said.
Ferrari had a lot of trouble in the previous match in Singapore.
He was asked what the result of the fall of the Mercedes.
They seem to go faster than us - so simple it is.
If I knew the reason for that, we would probably go at the same pace as they.
I don’t know it more than anyone else.
This is an everlasting guess, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
In the early days, we saw a rare taste for Raikkonen’s coming tall Sauber.
In the next season, Charles Leclerc was replaced by Ferrari and Marcus Ericsson was on the seventh place.
For Sweden, the 10th departure is the best for more than three years.
And although in the second driving session five drivers were completely missing, the result was still delicious for Sauber.
And encouraging to think about the future?
Yes, if compared to where they were from the beginning of the year, then the step forward has been great.
The next year will be a different story, so let’s see, let’s see.

The country’s vice president, Yusuf Kalla, said the total number of victims could rise to thousands.

Status symbols don't attract friends - Four facts about favour
What makes a person popular, charismatic or admired?
The researchers at the University of Sydney, who analyzed the matter, have identified two species of "coolius" consisting of slightly different characteristics: generally attractive coolius and, in the opposite part, interdependent coolius.
Attractively cool people, according to the researchers’ description, had many socially desirable features: they were externally oriented, friendly, suitable and qualified.
The opposite thinkers were typical of distance, independence, rebellion and crackdown.
They wasted the experiences and took little attention to the opinions of the outside.
Both types combined good self-esteem and a stable emotional life.
The role of the cowboy is not longer on is cool: high status in the teenage age may not necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is according to a study published in 2014 in the Journal of Child Development.
In young people who gathered early, billed, appealed to the gentle groups and sought to the popularity of others, as young adults, there was an increased risk of using patches and committing crimes.
In their relationships, they managed to be weaker than their previously unnoticed age colleagues.
High-stage locomotive cars, mark boxes or clocks don’t make a person cool – or at least a truly attractive accompany.
In an August study published in the Journal of Social Psychology and Personality Science, the majority of people were more prepared to get friends with their usual market dresses than with those wearing their mark dresses - despite the fact that most people chose to wear a mark dress in a dating situation.
If you’re on a holiday in Greece, be careful!
There is a storm, the weather warning is crying red.
During the weekend in southern Greece, there can be as much water as in Finland in an average of a half year.
The Zorbas storm will hit Greece during the weekend.
Be prepared if you stay in the area of Peloponnesus, the Ionian Islands, Cyclades or Crete.
The storm is very intense, so the Finnish Embassy in Athens announces it on its Facebook page.
According to the Embassy, the Greek climate service has given the regions a red weather warning.
It is also in the weather service Foreca blog.
The hardest trees of the storm are up to 45 meters per second.
As a result of the comparison, the Kuisma storm, which hit Finland since the beginning of the week, flooded at the heavest level at just 31 meters per second.
According to the blog, the biggest concern of the Zorbas storm, however, is not the wind, but the heavy rain.
Over the weekend, more than 300 millimeters of water can come to South Greece.
It accounts for about half of the annual rainfall in Finland.
The climate service Severe Weather Europe has shared a video about the development of the storm on its Facebook page.
The Zorbas storm has caused floods in Tunisia and Libya earlier this week.

Valtteri Bottas shocked and throwed adrenaline in Sotsh - will he become Hamilton's assistant on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas was slightly twisted a few minutes after he was driving the Russian GP as he was in front of the media.
The great round left behind Mercedes's 1st league Lewis Hamilton and was mentally certain important criticism for the Finnish player that collected this season.
A pleasant round.
I don’t know what happened to Lewis when he left the solution.
It feels good, and I’ll get a little more, Bottas explained.
I’ve been on the bal only once this year, in Austria (in the middle), so the time has passed quite the way.
This track has been good for me before, and I got good rounds again.
Sochi's track is not easy to pass, so the departure is in a big role.
But Bottas was wondering whether he would win tomorrow or whether Hamilton’s jees will come to the world championship.
The point of the game is that I try to win.
If there is no other goal, Bottas will go.
We are fighting for both championships.
Lewis’ leadership to Sebastian Vettel is quite big and the difference to me is very big, so I have to keep it in mind.
Let’s see what’s happening, but Bottas completed.
Hamilton was really pleased with the success of Bottas after the drive, and the Mercedek’s winterman Toto Wolff also tasted.
Lewis intended to win Valtter, but he failed to stop.
Valtter knows that he has to break everything for himself to win Lewis.
And he was so loaded that adrenaline was thrown out of the ear, Wolff swallowed.
Asked whether the teller will allow Bottas and Hamilton to run hard, Wolff replied.
We’ll talk tomorrow morning and see how the circle goes out.

More than 360,000 people have died in the war.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Friday in Germany that it is planned a Syrian meeting in October, in which she will be involved in addition to the presidents of France, Russia and Turkey.
Not exactly Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court's trial on TV
The Supreme Court candidate judge Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accuses him of harassment, got an extraordinary number of people along the roofs.
The full-powered U.S. Supreme Court Judge nomination drama received at least 20 million people on Thursday.
At that time, Kavanaugh, named by Donald Trump, and the California professor Blasey Ford, accusing him of harassment, were telling their story before the Senate’s Justice Committee.
According to the preliminary results, the consultations were followed by a total of 20.4 million viewers on six main channels: ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC.
Their add-on online consultation followed several million more.
NBC that the live stream was followed by 6.8 million people and CNN that it made its year record with 8.2 million live broadcasts launched.
CNN’s number rises to over 10 million, according to YouTube and Facebook followers.
Fox News Digital has reached 8.0 million.
The digital launch is the channel’s own, the TV viewers are from the research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen will publish the final readings on Monday, but they are in any case untouched.
Rarely to 20 million.
More than 20 million viewers in the U.S. are usually accessed only by sports matches, as well as the world’s great Oscars and Grammy Awards, as well as random political events such as presidential speeches and in 2016 presidential elections.
The U.S. National Football League (NFL) final to the Super Bowl is on the way.
This year, Super Bowl gathered around 103 million people on the NBC channel.
Last year, Trump’s first speech to Congress was viewed by a total of 48 million people and 30 million people in office.
The most important thing
The Supreme Court’s appointment is an extremely important case in the United States, as the offices are lifelong.
Trump has already been able to appoint a new judge after Antonin Scalia died in early 2016 and the Republicans have managed to prevent the then president Barack Obama from appointing his followers.
The second place opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced that he would retire this year.
Kennedy was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but he was in a number of matters the so-called Va'angeli, whose voice could resolve the position of the ninth court.
She was a supporter of the right to abortion and the rights of sexual minorities and decided, for example, in 2015, that the same-sex people were granted marriage rights throughout the federal state.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative.
His election to the Supreme Court may lock the right to the conservative power for decades.
Children have the right to access their information to their parents.
Only parents of children under 10 years of age can see their children’s health information from the Kanta service.
It’s a big problem, it’s wrong and it’s strange.
Initially, the situation in the Kanta service was, of course, even more worrying: parents were unable to see even the health information or prescriptions of young children.
The situation was temporarily corrected in the autumn of 2016 for people under 10 years of age.
After that, the practices have been promised to be corrected, but the correction has gone surprisingly long.
Now the repair is permitted - in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, the modification of the legal basis should not be more than transparent.
After that, the understanding of the landmark is about pressing the button: now when the stick is closed, it is opened.
Of course, a child can show his information to his parents - if he has a bank name or an official identity card.
How many of them are 10 years old?
The personal card is paid, and the bank names are not even available for the 10-year-old.
The information of a sub-school four-class is not practically accessible to anyone other than by asking them to be printed.
It is not the right of the parents but the right of the children.
It is extremely important for the child to be careful that the parents can be involved.
The right of teenagers to privacy must be cared for.
Even minors can have family situations where all things cannot be freely spoken.
Often they are related to sexual health, of which free care is a deeply relevant human rights.
In the United States, the FBI has begun the recovery of the disturbances against Kavanaugh
According to the U.S. media, the FBI is investigating at least two women’s harassment accusations.
One of the women was in the Senate’s judicial committee earlier this week.
Kavanaugh has denied accusations concerning alleged sexual harassment during his study period.
U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the accusations at the request of the Senate’s Justice Committee.
The examination should not take longer than a week.
According to the Washington Post, it is a criminal investigation of a more limited investigation and it is not necessarily going to be public.

Subsidy organizations are preparing to start work at Sulawes, Indonesia - "Clean water is the most urgent"
UNICEF and other international aid organizations are ready to help on the Indonesian island of Sulawes, says Finnish UNICEF news chief Kirsi Haru.
Local authorities are conducting rescue work, but the need for additional aid is already evident at this stage.
Unicef operates in almost every country, and we also have long-term programs in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operations, UNICEF is always fully prepared for emergency assistance, says Haru.
The first task is now to find people in the ruins, both surviving and dead.
In the town of Sulawes, the rescue operations are ongoing, but in the region of Donggala, a slightly north, the situation is unclear.
There are places where connections do not work.
The help is difficult because the roads are too distant, says Haru.
The buildings in Sulawes are often mild, so the damage caused by the earthquake and tsunami is large.
Once the survivors are found, they need protection - first on, for example, tents - and clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent.
First of all, people are most often able to provide water cleaning tablets that Unicef has in stock.
The water systems are intended to be repaid as soon as possible, but in an emergency, water is transported to its own hands, for example, by rays.
Many children have to get rid of their parents.
Searching for family members and uniting families is a part of the UNICEF mission field.
The World Food Programme is organized by the World Food Programme (WFP).
In the early stages of emergency aid, the previously collected funds are used.
The UNICEF has already started funding to help the victims of the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami.
Billionaire Elon Musk stops Tesla's presidency - $20 million fine for tweets
Elon Musk, the founder of the space missile and electric cars company, will avoid fraud accusations with the U.S. Securities Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk will terminate his post as chairman of the electric car company Tesla and agree to a $20 million fine.
Musk resigns as part of an agreement he signed with the U.S. Securities Authority.
By agreeing Musk avoids fraud accusations.
The U.S. Securities Commission (SEC) threatened Musk to be a debt due to his tweet in August.
In them, Musk wrote that he was preparing to withdraw the electric car company Tesla from the stock exchange, which led to the company’s stock exchange to a rapid rise.
According to the agreement, Musk will not be the chairman of Tesla for three years.
In addition, Tesla has to appoint a new "independent member" to its government and take two "independent leaders" into its management group.
Tesla also has to set up a committee to monitor Musk’s communication.
Musk will continue to be the CEO of Tesla.
In addition to Musk’s personal $20 million fine, Tesla will also have to pay the equivalent $20 million fine to the financial supervisor.
TWITHs Cheat Investors
According to the SEC, Musk’s tweets led investors and Tesla’s shareholders to be misleading.
Musk claimed that he would have secured funding to buy Tesla from the stock exchange back into a private stock company.
The billionaire tweeted that the company would have been bought out of the stock exchange for a price of $420.
Tesla’s shares rose over 10 percent per day after tweets, but fell later.
According to the SEC, Musk’s claims had no basis.
According to the supervisor, he had not actually negotiated on his claimed funding.
He also had not discussed the withdrawal from the stock exchange with another management group or the company’s government.
On Friday this week, the rate dropped by 14 percent when Securities and Securities Supervisors SEC fraud.
The news agreement is expected to reinforce the company’s course again.
The final judgment is not a reason.
The court clocks of the church are not sounding when the vigilants are not moving.
It is a technical error.
The clock at the Helsinki Court Tower has stopped.
The guests show at 12 p.m.
The situation is like a medium horror film: even when the crypt of the church belongs to the maneuver and the men call themselves.
This, of course, does not happen, but the clock has stopped for a technical reason: it has gone broken.
It has gone to the repair to look at, but some part has gone broken and a new part is expected to be done, says Eveliina Jamsen.
At the same time, James confirms the fact already mentioned on the Church in Helsinki Twitter account.
In fact, the account states that the last judgment is not a reason for the clock to stop.
Jamsen says that the church clocks don’t sound because of the fault.
