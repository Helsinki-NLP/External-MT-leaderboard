Although an experimental vaccine appears to be able to reduce the death rate from Ebola, no cure has yet been sufficiently effective to treat the existing infection.
Although administration of a cocktail of antibodies, ZMapp, initially showed promising signs in the field, formal studies demonstrated that its ability to limit deaths did not meet expectations.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp was used as a control, meaning that the scientists used it as a reference and compared it to the other three treatments.
The American Gymnastics Federation supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute necessity of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC statement that the interests of our athletes and our clubs, and their sport, could be better served by moving forward and making significant changes within our organization rather than revoking accreditation.
USA Gymnastics is supporting an independent investigation that could shed light on how the abuse of proportion so courageously described by Larry Nassar's survivors could go unnoticed for so long and adopt any necessary and appropriate change.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC have the same goal: to make gymnastics, as well as other sports, as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and empowering environment.

Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely held, but it provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's plumage was chestnut brown on the upper side and pale or carotenoid on the under side.
This discovery also sheds light on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers did not have a fully developed stem, called a tail, but did show other features specific to feathers  beards and barbels  the researchers deduced that the tail was probably a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers and not the down of a chick.
The scientists say that while it is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the sample reveals plumage belonging to an adult, not a juvenile.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.

The luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flux.
In terms of magnetic inversions, the smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a pull on the earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around a galaxy is in a kind of halo, and is made up of a large number of small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, put a pre-printed piece of paper in an envelope indicating the candidate of their choice.
After the officers have verified his identity, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs his voter's card.
The French Electoral Code regulates the operations quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelopes are present at the start of voting and no envelopes are added except those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to assist at each stage of the process, and in the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, according to specific procedures.

The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused persons had their faces covered when they appeared in court.
Although three people were present in the house when the car hit it, no one was injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road where the accident occurred has been temporarily blocked to allow emergency services to extract the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son by the Sheriff Court in Edinburgh.
She's in custody awaiting her arraignment and trial, but eyewitness accounts could be compromised because her portrait has been widely circulated.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and the courts have found that the publication of photos is potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, of the University of Dundee, notes that 'journalists seem to be following a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc. of suspects'.
The Crown Prosecutor's office, which is in charge of the overall prosecution, told reporters that no further comment will be made at least until the indictment.
After the leak, the document will focus on the border dispute that Palestine claims on the basis of the existing borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics discussed included the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority only agrees to a five-year period.
The shooters in the additional pest control test had to be closely monitored by rangers as the test was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) inc., qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting head of park and heritage conservation at NPWS, the four shooters assigned to the first slaughter campaign were properly trained and instructed in safety instructions.
Martelly inaugurated a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday, consisting of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth ECP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to put the country on the path to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the absence of elections, some of which were due to take place in 2011.
About 60 cases of defective iPod overheating were reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been made aware of 27 accidents involving these aircraft.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company described as "not serious".
The ministry reacted by calling it "very regrettable" that Apple postponed the report.
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 am local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office said no damage was reported in the country.
Furthermore, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center stated that there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman took tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six of them have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career as a doctor.
He trained as an obstetrician, and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating preterm births in his spare time.
His research demonstrated that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the lung maturation of the baby.
Xinhua news agency reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders (or  black boxes) on Wednesday.
The other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extreme, my first manager, and she died on the night of the two moons, a unique moment, just like her, a strong woman".
Dustin  Goldust  Runnels commented that  Luna was as weird as me... or even more so... I love her and I'm gonna miss her... I hope she's in a better place. 
A poll of 1,400 people ahead of the 2010 federal election found that the number of opponents of Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she thought Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of the respondents share this view, and wish that Queen Elizabeth II would be the last monarch to rule over Australia.
At the extremes of the poll, 29% of respondents think that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% think that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his fitness was called into question.
He was unable to take the medication necessary to overcome his pain, as it is forbidden during the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to date on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using various hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water for the earth, as well as organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and especially how the Earth formed, since comets collided with it long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "chattel and political nonsense".
He's thought to be running for president in 2016.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, limiting carbon emissions.
It is based on satellite technologies, not on ground-based radar systems used before, allowing air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more detailed information.
There is no additional transport and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and there are no car parks or relay parks on the ground.
The fear of lack of transportation has created the possibility that the match could be played behind closed doors, without the supporters of the teams.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the genesis of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden indicated that the new species had evolved in just two generations, although this process was estimated to have taken much longer, following the breeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the conical-beaked immigrant finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped in many ways.
It can be drawn in fine thread, which can be twisted and braided, and it can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be very thin, and glued onto another metal, and it can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted images in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical, and you can make an indicator using kale juice.
The colour of cabbage juice changes according to the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electron (since hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then, with clean, wet hands, squeeze them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will cause a strange sensation and produce a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every home, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of sewer systems have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women mingled.
When you call a person who's thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite picks up the call in space and sends it back to Earth almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet high to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways, but the biggest advantage it has brought us is that it has made transportation much easier and faster.
This brought us the train, the car and many other means of transportation.
Below are more medium-sized felines that eat also medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and other deer.
In addition, there are many small cats (including free-ranging pet cats) that eat smaller, much larger prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the nest, a special task given to each cat, preventing it from competing with the others.
Lions are the most sociable of all cats, living in large groups called packs.
The lions are herds of one to three related adult males, as well as about 30 females and young lions.
Women are usually very close to each other, their families being made up of a large number of sisters and daughters.
The lion troops act like pack wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in their behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A well-balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (but sometimes with difficulty), swim, jump for great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is part of the same family (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars, and these four are the only felines that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's roar, but rather like a phrase whose words would be cries and roars.
The bird-eaters are fond of small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals the bird-eater hunts are much smaller than him.
Scientists believe that ocelots hunt and find prey by sniffing, or sniffing, their way across the ground.
They see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision, and they also move very stealthily.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originated (for example, if it moves over a mountain range or a river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily return), it often finds itself in a different environment from the one it was in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need new characteristics or adaptations to be a powerful competitor compared to what it needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, it still needs the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they can no longer be considered to be members of the same species.
We call this process  speciation , which simply means the formation of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, breathe).
Plants produce food by photosynthesizing sunlight and provide shade.
We make our homes and our clothing from plants, and most of the food we eat is plant-based, and without plants, animals would not survive.
The mosasaur was the super-predator of the day, fearing nothing but the other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws had over 70 sharp teeth like razor blades, and an extra set of teeth in the palate, so that anything that crossed its path could not escape.
We're not sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, its diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have even been cannibalistic.
It also attacked anything that entered the water, and even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex was no match for it.
Although the Romans ate some of the food we know, they ate some strange or unusual feast foods, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and the loir, a type of rodent.
Another difference was that while the poor and the woman ate their meals sitting on chairs, the rich men enjoyed having banquets together where they rested on their sides while they ate their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not include these foods of American or Asian origin that were introduced to Europe centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a main temple that was considered the dwelling place of the god.
People were making sacrifices to the gods, and the priests were trying to satisfy the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, which only the priests could enter.
Certain pyramidal towers, the ziggurats, were sometimes built as elements of a temple.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not that important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were open counters facing the street; houses were built in stone.
Since there were no large forests in the land of Canaan, the wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and that he found Greenland and named it so when travelling further west.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country is  Scandinavian, there are many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie Benjamin Gates and the Templar Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is an inscription on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words  The original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776  were written. The text is found at the bottom of the document, in reverse.
Although no one really knows who wrote it, it is known that at an early stage of its existence the large parchment (about 29 by 24 inches) was stored in a roll.
So it's likely that the notation was added simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, Frenchmen who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupier instead of confronting him.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies landed in southern France, an invasion known as Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French Forces had liberated southern France and were moving toward Germany.
A civilization is a singular culture shared by a large group of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The term  civilization  is derived from the Latin word  civilis , meaning civil and related to the Latin words  civis , meaning citizen, and  civitas , meaning large city or city-state and also indicating, in a way, the size of the society to which it refers.
A civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural imprint and an equitable diffusion.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical traces and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government with Congress as its only component under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, as there was no national executive or judicial power, it relied on the state authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce all its acts.
Nor did it have the power to derogate from tax laws or customs duties between states.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, along with the German national team, the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the group of islands that make up Japan, it is often referred to geographically as an  archipelago .
The first records of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when European navigators passing through Taiwan referred to it as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, introducing a transformation of indigenous grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared it a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (18941895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which then ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Hall of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings bordering the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better glimpse of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and this restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world is 35 mm; it was the most common film format at the end of the analogue film era.
It's still made today, but what's important is that its image format is inherited from the digital camera's image sensor format.
The 35mm format is actually, and it's quite disconcerting, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
So the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest of the whole number ratios) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS family of formats) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is often abused and ridiculed, is simply a directive that encourages dynamism while protecting the image.
It indicates that the most efficient place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, was challenged.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity held the European states together despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to relieve suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds are there specifically for that reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over 1,000 years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this doctrine was being upheld.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain established a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy proved effective, cutting vital military and civilian supplies, though the blockade violated generally accepted international law and was codified by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from venturing into entire sea areas, thus posing a threat even to neutral ships.
As this tactic provoked only a timid reaction, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unlimited submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations showed a penchant for pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, the nations wished to prevent such a situation from recurring in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four hundred to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his director in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing the different eras; each stage of China or each family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also an unstable age of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods is the Three Kingdoms era which ran for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these times, fierce struggles took place between many members of the nobility who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, thousands of people died fighting to sit on the throne of the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political repercussions such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
So after the Revolution, the trades were opened to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same is true of the military, because the ranking of the armies is no longer based on class, but on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressed working classes in other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond the scope of this worldly life. He used to frequent a cave which became famous as  Hira' on the mountain of  Noor (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which survived the time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on a mountaintop north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists, because when you go into the cave, you're completely isolated.
Above, one can contemplate nothing but the clear and beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, one can see or hear very little of this universe.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians during the third millennium B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of many giant structures erected in honor of deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis, in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, is home to several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, many temples and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor his wives and family members.
The symbol  push  looks like a V and the symbol  pull  looks like a square or a square with the bottom side missing.
The top means you have to start at the tip and pull the bow, and the bottom means you have to start at the top (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An upward archet generally produces a softer sound, while a downward archet is louder and more assertive.
Feel free to write your own markings in pencil, but remember that the printed arrow marks are for a musical motif, and therefore should generally be respected.
On 6 October 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-ThÃ©rÃ¨se, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and the king's sister, Madame Ã‰lisabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of saleswomen.
They rode back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a mob of people who were shouting and threatening the king and queen.
The king and queen were forced by the crowd to open the windows of their carriages.
At one point, a member of the crowd brandished the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles before the terrified queen.
The war costs of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover much of the cost and interest of the bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking institutions.
Of course, the superprofits from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people could be the fundamental advantages of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
These events occurred in the period generally considered the High Middle Ages  the period of history in Europe running from the 11th to the 13th century (1000-1300).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from the technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense that the fate of humanity is dictated by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies.
Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself takes place in a process that far exceeds cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on societies conditioned intrinsically rather than socially.
For example, it could be said that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The mass car ownership also leads to a greater incidence of road accidents, leading to the invention of new techniques in the field of health care to treat bodily injuries.
Romanticism featured an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
According to Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and, over time, a culture and customs linked to geography emerged, which, in harmony with the places occupied by society, were preferable to arbitrary laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD, and lasted until about 1100.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, with which Byzantine markets could hardly compete.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 11th and 14th centuries.
At first, the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, because of the slowness of the means of communication, the Western modes could be 25 to 30 years behind.
During the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the greatest advances of the period, following the Crusades, was the use of buttons for closing clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture practiced to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, system using preserved seeds native to the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and who share the same ideas, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership by a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses fashions, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune or willful abuse, were not socialized by adults during their childhood.
Some wild children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of such a child was due to the parents' rejection of a serious intellectual or physical disability the child suffered from.
Wild children may have suffered severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by non-human species, wild children display behaviors (within the limits of their physical dispositions) that are almost identical to those of the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project pedagogy should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes further.
Support is not a method of learning but rather a way of helping learners who are discovering a new teaching such as using a new programme or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real, so a teacher is a form of support, but the little trombone man in Microsoft Office is also a form of support.
The virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to question, guide and explain procedures that might have been too difficult for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide range of reasons, from neglect to abuse to extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, caring and educational, but it is.
We perceive the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
The placement in a foster family is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approaches to uses and gratifications.
For example,  learning  and  socialization  are considered to be major factors in promoting Internet use (James et al., 1995).
 Personal involvement  and  ongoing relationships  were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied public reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to major discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, that is, facial expressions for a few milliseconds.
One claim is that it can detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, showed how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behaviour may be found in animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination cause the variations between the two basins to alternate with each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a human-like digestive system to satisfy its amino acid needs from available plant resources.
Furthermore, failure to respond has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, termite, eggs) are easily digested and provide a high amount of protein containing all the vital amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their  protein problem  in much the same way that savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your sleep period and falling asleep shortly afterwards (between 10 and 60 minutes).
This can be done easily using a relatively quiet alarm clock, so as to bring you back to consciousness without waking you completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock while you sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids before going to sleep (such as water or tea, which are known to be diuretics), which forces you to wake up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace of a person is opposed to the degree of tension in his body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force is, and each person has the possibility of finding absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing that stands in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been enriched by the path of Mahayana love and by many techniques of Indian yoga.
The basic principles of Tibetan Buddhism are very simple, consisting of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of illumination) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The focus of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of deity, and it is through the visualization of different deities that the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of awakening is created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, the deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures ended the understanding between these two countries.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would see real-world combat, through surrogate armies, on battlefields as diverse as Africa and Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences were already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
But these plans became obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 Red Army troops from the Soviet Union arrived and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian front after invading the eastern regions of Poland, thus violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, as well as other international treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way of moving large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The Marines' job has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and your property, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and their property.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, when the Americans tried to bring troops and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany probably could have conquered Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them close to them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skins.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by shepherds who were mostly children or teenagers, similar to the more familiar term shepherds.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagon tracks were simply parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the slightly more rugged roads of the day.
Crossings were introduced early enough to keep the tracks in place, but it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more efficient if they had a band of iron on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767, the first iron rails appeared.
The first means of locomotion was walking: humans began walking upright two million years ago with the arrival of Homo Erectus ( upright man ).
Their predecessors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright as they usually did.
Two-legged specialization is found in the fossil Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus was able to walk on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even campaign to alleviate future suffering.
In many cases, this is a symptomatic treatment, but if we want more than just a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems and disable them.
Clearly, the world has changed a great deal because of the scientific and technological advances made by man, and the problems have become more important because of overpopulation and man's extravagant life-style.
After it passed Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing plant.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as  Dunlap Broadsides .
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One of these was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who read it to his troops in New York on 9 July, and a copy was sent to London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap leaves that are known to still exist are the oldest copies of the document.
Many paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive, and they are called birds.
Few people consider them dinosaurs, given that they have wings and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still resemble a dinosaur.
They have scaled, clawed feet, they lay eggs, and they walk on their hind legs like T-rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits, or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting may be general enough to make an immediate diagnosis unlikely.
The best indication of internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of toxic medication or household chemicals.
Check the label for first aid instructions specific to this toxin.
The term  insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of  insects.
The term comes from an old familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects very well suited to parasitize humans.
Bedbugs, like bedbugs, are nest-builders, that is, they are adapted to live in the nest or habitat of their host.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple may feel that it is not in their best interests - or in the child's - to be involved in the rearing of a baby.
These couples may choose to make an adoption project for their baby.
Adoption is when the biological parents end their parental rights so that another couple can take care of the child.
The main objective of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, which guides most scientific research.
But it's not the only one, experimentation, and an experiment is a test that serves to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, ask questions and make observations, but also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have focused on ancient texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to cycle for a period of time, even in the absence of external stimulation.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments to mark either the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the size of the affected portion of the genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only germ cell mutations can be passed on to children, while other mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism is for people who want to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including the fauna and flora.
Hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks and studying ecosystem information are examples of on-site activities.
For example, you can go and see, photograph and learn about the Bornean orangutans.
Every morning, people drive from small towns to the countryside to their workplace and meet other people who are going to work in the countryside they just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is connected to and supports a transport system based on individual cars.
Science now shows that this massive carbon-based economy has dislodged the biosphere from its stable state that has sustained human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they break down daily? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and particular vehicles between two points, and the interactions they exert with each other.
Unfortunately, it's difficult to study the flow of traffic because the behavior of drivers can't be predicted with a hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically in an approximate way.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) throughput, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to escape from predators and to find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them more and more small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are dragonflies and the ephemeral fly.
A few thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite - that the solar system revolved around the earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
That seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times the volume of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on the planet, sometimes reaching 10 km wide.
No less than 20 percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main branch of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long, and it collects water from thousands of smaller streams.
Although stone pyramid construction continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in size and technical excellence of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, the Vatican is the world's smallest independent country, and the least populous.
The Vatican City is responsible for drafting its legislation and official communications in Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
Citizens of Vatican City are all Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have been familiar with basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, as they are found in nature in crude form and are quite easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything in the universe was made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
Rather, he was talking about the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that these would change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals, and remember that the periodic table has many elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course, there are metals like silver and gold.
Alloys containing a small amount of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon, are also available.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to a lot of people when it came out.
Unfortunately, the advent of new types of writing has relegated the pen to a more confidential status and to rarer uses.
People are now writing messages on computer screens, without ever having to go near a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when the next new thing comes along.
The fission bomb works by the following principle: it transforms energy by assembling a nucleus of myriads of protons and neutrons.
It's like driving a heavy cart up a hill, by splitting the nucleus again, and then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, so they tend to break apart with little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust, and its outer layer is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the visible side and 100 km on the hidden side.
It is thinner at sea level and thicker under continents.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner, and it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered around finding out what makes people feel good or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories examine what drives some people to want the things they do and what in their environment drives them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviours can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain  the good buddy  (or the good girlfriend).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, conducting evaluations, delegating responsibility, and holding others accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that he/she has to change everything that the group has created so far and do things his/her own way.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This often leads to disagreements between the management and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet in different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a real  invisible team  (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team to which each member is accountable, and sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organisation want to take on the tedious process of creating a learning structure?One of the goals of implementing organisational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can be fully expressed.
Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the customer's need.
Before an organisation can innovate, its management must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and its own culture of learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organisations achieve better results.
Neurobiological data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, and thus allow the field of research to be narrowed and made much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, lesions, tumors, and trauma affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that we've never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our mind.
Although AI is often strongly connoted as science fiction, it represents a very important part of computer science that studies the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
The research in artificial intelligence is aimed at automation by machines of tasks requiring an intelligent approach.
Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnostics and customer questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These practices have led to distinct disciplines, focused on providing solutions to the problems of everyday life.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as it has been featured in several home computer software and video games.
Excursions are an integral part of any school classroom, and oftentimes a teacher would like to take his pupils to places where a bus trip is not possible.
The solution is provided by technology in the form of virtual educational outings where students can look at antique objects in a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a beautiful work of art while sitting with their class.
Practically participating in a trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future generations.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year to honor their visit to the state's capital, and each year the website is updated, but older versions are kept online as an album.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills, and while students often attempt the blogging experience with a poor grammar and spelling, having an audience usually makes the difference.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger starts to work on improving her writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging  forces students to know more about the world around them . The need to arouse public interest drives students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning well beyond the traditional school day.
"When used properly, blogs ""can enable students to strengthen their analytical and critical thinking skills: by actively responding to online content, they can compare their opinions with those of others and express their own views on specific topics"" (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and has a large number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south you will find Niagara Falls and to the north, the Muskoka region and its surroundings, which are of unspoiled natural beauty.
All these and many other measures make Ontario what foreigners consider to be the quintessence of Canada.
Large areas further north are fairly sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited in the wild.
For a population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest country, and indeed a continent in its own right, when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known for being luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought the practice of Islam to the mainland and this religion was widely spread in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route linking Europe to India.
The region is bounded to the north by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman travelling should say that she is married, regardless of her marital status.
He is also advised to carry a ring (which should not seem too precious.
Women need to realise that certain cultural differences can lead to behaviours which they perceive as harassment, as it is common to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting male advances, and don't be afraid to hold on (cultural differences or not, it doesn't mean it's acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and the Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese, who had rebuilt it and named it Casa Branca after its destruction, finally abandoned it in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in all of Morocco to shop.
Around the old medina, one can easily find places where you can buy traditional Moroccan products, such as tajines, pottery, leather goods, narguilÃ©s and all kinds of trinkets, but that's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano that buried most of the city streets, especially the downtown area.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma should be researched to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano as well as for some of the cheapest mountain gorilla treks in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (moto taxi) to get around Goma.The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a small ride.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility,  Timbuktu  has become a metaphor for distant and exotic lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates'  Wonders of the African World  on PBS.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country, as it has more of an Arab style than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The total area of the park is 19 500 km2, divided into 14 ecozones, each with a specific fauna.
It is one of the best-known theme parks in South Africa and is considered the crown jewel of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily entry and conservation fees for the park.
It may be advantageous to obtain a Wild Card which gives access to certain South African parks, as well as to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the name of the territory of Hong Kong and is the main attraction for many tourists.
The row of buildings that line Hong Kong's skyline has been likened to a glittering bar chart, reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To enjoy the most beautiful views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront, which is located opposite.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the north shore landfills.
This is the place that the British colonists invested in, so it seems to me like a good place to start if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past of this region.
The Sundarbans are the largest belt of coastal mangroves in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterlands.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the part of the forest located on Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps, however. They also contain some of the last remnants of the majestic jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water/marshland areas.
The Sundarbans has been a nature reserve since 1966, and you can find about 400 royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer here.
Buses leave from the interdistrict bus station (located on the other bank) throughout the day, but most, especially those serving the east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30 in the morning.
Inter-district buses are often full, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the districts are served by small, comfortable, and sturdy Japanese cabs.
Public taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge over the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters; it is 378 meters long and has two 3.5-meter wide tracks.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft).[citation needed] The structure was completed in August 2011, but was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the largest indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practicing subsistence agriculture.
Other indigenous tribes inhabiting the Chaco, such as the GuaycurÃº and the PayaguÃ¡, relied on fishing, hunting, and gathering for sustenance.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, once called the "Giant Province of the Indies", was born from the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of AsunciÃ³n in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and some of the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Las CaÃ±itas polo courts.
In addition, smaller tournaments and matches are sometimes held here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, see the AsociaciÃ³n Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Malvinas is the Malvinas pound (FKP) which is equivalent to one pound sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The pound sterling is a commonly accepted currency throughout the islands, while in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On nearby islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and American currency may be.Speak to the owners in advance to agree on a payment method.
It's almost impossible to exchange Malvinas money outside the islands, so change it before you leave the islands.
Montevideo is located south of the Equator, so winter in the northern hemisphere is equivalent to summer there and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics and summer temperatures exceeding 30 Â°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but wind and humidity combine to make it appear colder than the thermometer says.
There are no seasons of rain and dry seasons: rainfall is almost constant throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, these are still wild animals; please do not feed or disturb them.
According to the park authorities, you should stay at least 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from all other wild animals!
Although they may appear docile, bison, elk, moose, bear, and almost any other large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep enough distance, and these animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, be aware that the smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking smelling food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, and is located on the island of Upolu, with a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of a notorious naval stalemate in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
The Tupua supreme leader Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated during a peaceful rally in the city during the Mau movement's independence struggle.
The beaches are numerous, as Auckland is bordered by two harbors, the most popular being in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy and safe for swimming, and most are shaded by pohutukawa.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitemata Harbour in the chic suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These beaches, which are sometimes very popular with families, have many shops along the coast, and swimming is safe.
The main local beer is  Number One , a fairly ordinary, but tasty and refreshing beer.
There are many French wines to sample, but perhaps the New Zealand and Australian wines will travel better.
You can drink the local tap water safely, but you can easily find bottled water if you have concerns about it.
For Australians, the idea of a "cream coffee" is foreign. A short black is an "espresso", the cappuccino is filled with cream (no foam) and the tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, in the north of 1770, box jellyfish are found near beaches and estuaries, and they can sometimes be seen outside this period.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans, and most of them are afraid of humans and would stay away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their main habitat is in the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind of knowing that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book through travel agencies other types of accommodation, such as camping.
Travel agencies usually offer packages including breakfast, airport transfers or even flight and accommodation packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents necessary for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, any changes or requests should be addressed to the travel agency first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants decide to camp on-site, and most consider this to be an integral part of the experience.
If you want to get up close and personal with the music event, you're going to have to get there early to find a well-placed campground.
Please note that while the musical performances are over on the main stages, other musical performances may continue late into the night at other festival venues.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in winter, be sure to check the cabin's location, as ice crossing can cause unbearable noises in the most exposed cabins.
The cruises in St Petersburg include time spent in the city.
Casinos generally make many efforts to maximize the time and money spent by customers. Windows and clocks are rarely found, and exits can be difficult to spot.
They usually offer special offers of food, drink and entertainment to keep the good mood of the guests and keep them there.
Some sites are the locals who offer free alcohol, but the intoxication impairs judgment, and every good gambler knows that it's crucial to stay sober.
Anyone who travels by car over high latitudes or crosses mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, it can fall enough snow in a very short time to block you.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or dust or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are common in many countries, and traffic is virtually uninterrupted all year round.
The safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight of the season for many visitors.
In common parlance, the term  safari  refers to an excursion to the African land, and especially to the savanna, with the purpose of witnessing the breathtaking spectacle of wild animals in their environment.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars and standard equipment allows them to be observed.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you'll see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as bushwalking, walking safari or walking safari) is a form of hiking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021 with some events held in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympic Games, after hosting the Games in 1964.
If you have booked your flights and accommodation in 2020 before the postponement announcement, you may be facing a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with typical tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Many hotels have an iron and a board that can be borrowed, even if there is no iron in the rooms.
If you don't have an iron or don't feel like wearing socks that have been ironed, you can try using a hair dryer, if you can find one.
Avoid overheating the fabric (which may cause it to shrink or in extreme cases, burn).
There are different methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, the water may be boiled for a minute; in others, it may be boiled for several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you have a concern, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter pests unknown to them in their native region.
Parasites can contaminate food, cause irritation, or in the most severe cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are not generally considered parasites.
In some places, duty-free shops provide an opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on such items as alcoholic beverages or tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often passing through isolated backcountry terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep an open mind: steep slopes, narrow lanes and tight curves predominate.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than on the previous and following sections - generally 35 to 40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and their strict adherence is even more important than before.
However, the mobile service is curiously much stronger here than on many other parts of the road, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastry is a common feature of the region. Apples are baked and cooked all year long, while cherries and plums are the highlight of the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts.Popular cakes often go particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but plump pastries, try the Berliner balls, also called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
Curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, and served with meat or vegetables.
A curry dish can be  solid  or  liquid , depending on the amount of sauce it contains.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesia is made up of 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without qualification, the term tends to refer to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a range of simply seasoned dishes, the predominant flavours that Javanese people favour being peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the user, but they can pose a safety problem, as the user's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse, but has a foot caught in the stirrup, he could be dragged if the horse runs away.
First, most horsemen wear riding boots with a flat, rather narrow heel and sole.
Then, some saddles, especially British saddles, have safety bars that allow a stallion to fall off the saddle if it is pulled backwards by a rider who falls.
CochamÃ³ Valley  The ultimate climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with many great granite walls and different cliffs.

Skiing is a major travel activity with many aficionados, sometimes called  ski bums , who arrange their entire vacation around skiing in specific locations.
The idea of skiing is very old: cave paintings showing skiers date back to some 5,000 B.C.
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century; the first recreational ski club was founded in 1861 in Australia by Norwegians.
Skiing: this activity is also called Nordic skiing, cross-country skiing or skiing.
It is similar to alpine-type skiing, as well as mountaineering, but does not generally incorporate these activities, which are practiced on rough terrain and require the use of much more rigid skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
In good conditions, you can cover slightly longer distances than on foot  but you will rarely reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on damaged tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it is made up of many independent countries, so in normal circumstances travelling through several countries involves making several visa applications and undergoing several passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, functions a bit like a single country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each of the countries in the area separately, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of whether a manufactured object is an antique, and some taxing agencies define items over 100 years old as antiques.
The criteria vary from place to place; in some parts of the world, such as North America, the age limit may be lower than in Europe.
Craft products may be considered antiques, even if they are less old than similar industrial products.
Reindeer herding is an important means of livelihood for the Sami people and the culture surrounding this trade is of great importance for many other professions.
Although tradition has it that not all Sami were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, they subsisted on fishing, hunting and other similar activities, while using reindeer primarily as draught animals.

The opinions are merely a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Violent weather is the umbrella term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that may cause damage, severe social disruption or loss of life.
Extreme adverse weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world and may be of several types, depending on geographical, topographical and atmospheric characteristics.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall and fires are forms and effects of violent weather, as are storms, tornadoes, sea thunder and cyclones.

Travellers are strongly advised to inquire about the risks of bad weather in their region of destination, as this may affect their intended itinerary.
Anyone who is planning to travel to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive vocational training.
An internet search for Hostile environment course  will likely provide the address of a local business.
A course will normally cover all the issues covered here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A training course normally lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines on wildlife survival are common, but there are few publications on war zones.
Travellers planning to undergo sex change surgery abroad should ensure that they have valid documents for their return journey.
Governments' willingness to issue passports with no gender indicated (X) or documents updated to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honour these documents varies as well.

Transgender people in the preoperative phase should not expect to pass the scans while preserving their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are currents that return from waves breaking on the beach, often on a cliff or equivalent.
Due to the undersea topology, the return flow is concentrated on a few deeper sections, and a fast current to the deep water can form there.
In most cases, death is due to exhaustion resulting from an attempt to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you're out of the current, the swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to aim for a place where you won't be caught again. It's also possible, depending on your skills and whether or not you've been spotted, that you might want to wait for rescue.

Travellers who have had a hard time adjusting to a new culture may have a hard time adjusting to their original culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and have lost some of your original habits.
When you first traveled to a foreign country, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adjust.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually, we always hear the noise of tourists and vendors.

Scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of research stations and sixteen are active as of 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula, with King George Island, with the village of Villa Las Estrellas, being the largest.
Other examples include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula melt into the plateau, then re-emerge to form the 360-kilometer-long Ellsworth Mountain Range, which is crossed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, contains the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Range, which reaches 4,892 m (15,980 ft).
In remote areas where there is no cellular network, you may have no choice but to use satellite telephony.
A satellite phone is not usually a replacement for a cell phone, since you have to be outside and have a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
This is a service often used by shipping, including pleasure boats, as well as by shipping that needs long-distance data transmission and telephony.
Your local telephone company should be able to tell you more about connecting to this service.
Those who plan a sabbatical year have the opportunity to learn while traveling, and more and more of them are choosing this opportunity.
This is particularly appreciated by young people leaving school, as it allows them to take a year off before university without compromising their studies.
Often, taking a gap year abroad can actually give you a better chance of getting a higher education in your own country.
In general, these programmes require a registration fee.
Finland is a popular destination for yachting, and the "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands in lakes and coastal archipelagos.
You don't need a yacht in the archipelago and on the lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are indeed large enough for a yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat for seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden and New Zealand are in the same situation, but other than that, it is a unique case (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises feature an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic town for a few whole days while returning to sleep on the boat at night.
If you only go ashore on cruise excursions, you will not need a separate visa (from 2009).
The city of Berlin, Germany, is mentioned in some cruise brochures. As you can see by consulting the map above, Berlin is not located near the seafront at all and no visit to this city is included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It is not something to be ashamed of, it is not unlike the personal fears and apprehensions that many people have about other things.
For some, understanding something about how planes operate and what happens during flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or on not being in control.
Transport companies are well paid for fast delivery, and in many cases, in the context of an urgent repair, the issue of deadlines is crucial for the documents, goods or spare parts involved.
On some routes, the big companies have their own planes, but on other routes and for the small companies, there was a problem.
If they had sent goods by air freight, on some routes, it would have taken days to clear customs and customs.
The only way to get it there faster was to send it as checked baggage, because airline regulations don't allow them to send a bag without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The most obvious way to travel first or business class is to pay a large sum for the privilege (or, better yet, to have your company do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy rate for business class, and 11 times for first class!
In general, there is no point in trying to get discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines are well aware that they can count on a certain type of passenger who is willing to pay dearly for the privileges of speed and comfort, and they set their fares with that knowledge.
The capital of Moldova is ChiÅŸinÄƒu, the local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that suffers from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
With a population of 3.7 million, Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, the second largest port after Istanbul, and an excellent transport hub.
What was the ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed and lively commercial center, situated around a huge bay, surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass buildings and modern shopping centres are dotted with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere that is more Mediterranean European than traditional Turkish.

As you travel north, be sure to visit the magnificent shrine of Our Lady of Fatima, a world-famous site for Marian apparitions.
Remember, you are basically visiting a mass grave, as well as a site that has almost incalculable significance for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many women and men alive who survived their stay here, and many others who saw their loved ones murdered or killed by forced labor, Jews or Gentiles alike.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves.
Do not deface the site by marking or scratching graffiti on structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and practically everyone is able to speak Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, as the law establishes that it is the first official language.
Yet, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, but unforeseen disturbances are announced by an automated system in many languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.

The abrupt Parisian exterior evaporates quickly if you show a little courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely forested, mainly beech, spruce and fir, and features a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The country has a wide variety of plant communities due to its diverse microclimates, soils and altitude levels.
The region is also home to a very wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat, and the great tetra can be seen here, as well as many other common species.
When visiting a monastery, women must wear skirts that cover their knees and have their shoulders also covered.

Just like men have to wear pants that cover the knees.
You can also borrow this clothing from the store at the entrance, but since it is not washed after each use, you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (mostly pork), and uses olive oil.

However, those who speak some Spanish might hastily conclude that Portuguese is close enough to it that it does not need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete today, and remain in place as museums or educational sites.
As light pollution in their day was not as much of a concern as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, which are more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge infrastructures placed in remote regions where atmospheric conditions are favorable.
The contemplation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were the favorite flower.

Many traditions connected with these festivals have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians worldwide.
It is the tradition to spend the night of Easter awake in an open place to watch the sunrise.
There are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, with congregations often breaking into the festivities at the stroke of midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that have arrived on these islands have originally done so by water, by swimming, by floating on objects, or by air.
The great distance from the mainland has prevented the mammals from completing the journey, making the giant tortoise the principal grazing animal of the Galapagos.
Since humans arrived in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you can experience the polar night, during which the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good time to see the northern lights, as the sky will be dark for most of the day.
Since the regions are sparsely populated, and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you can also enjoy the stars.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be used to.
The costumes are standard work clothes, and the employees are called by their surnames or by their position.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, as it emphasises collective effort rather than individual achievements.
Workers often have to get the approval of their superiors for any decision they make and are expected to obey the instructions of their superiors without question.
