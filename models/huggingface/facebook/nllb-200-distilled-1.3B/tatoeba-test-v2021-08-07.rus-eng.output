White pawn on f3, black pawn on e6, white pawn on g4, black pawn on h4 - mat! In chess circles this is jokingly called "stupid mat".
White: pawn on a1, pawn on b6, king on c8. Black: pawns on a7 and b7, king on a8, elephant on b8. White places opponent in Zugzwang position by placing the pawn on a6, after which black has only two options: take the pawn on a6 or move the elephant to any other square diagonally b8-h2.
