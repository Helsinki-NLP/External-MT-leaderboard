Members of the Welsh Assembly (AM) are concerned about 'looking like a doll'
There was concern among some AMs over the proposal that their names should be changed to MWP (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
It arose from a plan to change the name of the conference to the Parliament of Wales.
AM across the political spectrum is worried it could invite boredom.
An AM from the Labour Party said his party cared about ia berima with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: In Wales, twp means crazy and pwp means disgusting.
AM from Plaid said his party as a whole was unhappy and had suggested an alternative.
A Welsh Conservative said his party was openly considering the name change, but stated it was a brief verbal jump from the MWP to the Dolls.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is referred to as the same as the Yorkshire English designation for the letter u.
The Council Commission, which is drafting legislation to introduce the name change, said: "The final decision on any nomination of any so-called Members of the Council must be a matter for the members themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh council the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission announced the outcome of public consultations on a widely supported proposal to call the council as the Parliament of Wales.
As for the AM title, the Commission was preferred by the Members of the Parliament of Wales or WMP, but the MWP's choice received the most support in public consultation.
AM appears to be proposing an alternative, but is having trouble reaching a consensus and may be upsetting its chief of staff, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft law on the changes in a few weeks.
The law on the renewal of the Terms included other changes to the way the council functions, including rules on the loss of AM qualifications and the design of the committee system.
The AM will get the final vote on what questions to address when they discuss the law.
Macedonia made a referendum on changing the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday whether to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote was established in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which had its own territory called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly denied its bid for membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the name change vote, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is just the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Square is destroyed by the churches in Harlem
"The parents I met said, historically, there were bars and churches on every street corner", said Mr. Adams.
"Today, they're both gone".
He said losing the bar is understandable.
"People are socializing differently these days", she says.
"The bar is no longer a living room in the neighborhood where people will always go".
For the church, he worried that the money from the sale of assets would not last as long as the leaders expected, "and they would eventually go back to where they started".
Churches, he said, could be replaced with apartment buildings and condominiums inhabited by people who would not help maintain the remaining shrines in the neighborhood.
"The majority of people who will buy condos in this building are white people", he said, "and therefore will make these churches completely closed because it is unlikely that most people who enter these condos will be members of the churches".
Both churches were built by white settlers before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original Methodist church moved in the 1930s.
The black church that had worshipped nearby had taken ownership of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by the black under the Hon. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, opposing the hiring or promotion of blacks in employment.
A fire in 1939 caused the building to be badly damaged, but as Pastor Johnson made plans to rebuild, they ordered the tower bells.
David Johnson, son and successor of the Reverend Johnson at St. Martin, proudly referred to the tower bell as the "Poor People's Bell".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else:  Cultural treasures and  irreplaceable historical instruments.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also stated that it was the world's first bell to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger bell at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's was not his replacement.
What has been played at St Martin's in recent months has become a nuisance to architects and contractors, some brought by church leaders, others by Episcopal bishops.
The Vestri Room - the governing body of the congregation, composed of civil leaders - wrote to the bishop in July with concerns that the bishop "will seek to approve the cost" for the vestry room, even though the vestry room was not involved in the recruitment of architects and contractors brought in by the bishop.
Some members of the congregation complained about a lack of transparency in the bishop's office.
Shrimps injured a 13-year-old boy while diving for a California shrimp
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he dived for shrimp in California on the opening day of the shrimp season, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego he was diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then rowed along with a group of people to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said at first he thought it was just a fun scream to catch a shrimp, but he realized the boy was screaming, "I got bitten!"
I got a bite!
His entire tendon was torn and opened, Hammel said he noticed when he got the kid.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: 'There are sharks in the water!' added Hammel.
The child was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was listed in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Rescue Captain Larry Giles said in a media briefing that sharks had been found in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined to be a harmless species of shark.
Giles added the victim suffered a traumatic injury to the upper body.
Officials have blocked access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Giles notes that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered to be dangerous.
Sainsbury's plan to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury took Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams from a beauty salon in a multi-storey house run by a skilled maid.
As part of the effort to enter the £2.8 billion beauty market in the UK, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and home appliances return, larger beauty spaces will be tested in 11 stores across the country and brought to more stores next year if it bears fruit.
Investment in beauty emerged as the supermarket sought ways to use the shelf space previously claimed for TVs, microwave ovens and home appliances.
Sainsbury said it'll double the size of its beauty offerings to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing range of products from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with branded parts like those found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also relaunched a range of Boutique-friendly products to make the majority vegan-friendly - something that is increasingly in demand among young buyers.
In addition, fragrance shop dealers will test concession at two Sainsbury's supermarkets, the first opening in Croydon, south London, last week while the second opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Shopping online and moving towards buying a little bit of food every day at local convenience stores means supermarkets need to work harder to convince people to come.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury, said the branch would look like a general store as the supermarket chain tries to counter the big business Aldi and Lidl with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury has placed branches of Argos in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several locations since it bought both chains two years ago, reportedly increasing retail sales and making acquisitions more profitable.
The former supermarket wanted to adapt to the beauty and pharmaceutical sectors that ended in failure.
Sainsbury tried a joint venture with Boot in early 2000, but the partnership ended after they argued about how to split the revenue from the pharmacy at its supermarket.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury sold 281 pharmacy stores to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125 million, three years ago.
He said Lloyds played a role in the plan, adding a range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy to the four buildings.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have changed the look and feel of our beauty spaces to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invested with specially trained friends to be prepared to offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet every need, and the attractive environment and convenient location means we are now an exciting beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping".
Peter Jones 's a bear' after Holly Willoughby pulled out an offer of £11 million
Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, 'goes wild' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out an £11 million deal with lifestyle brand business to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for household items and accessories from the Truly brand.
The couple's business was likened to the Goop brand by Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning's host, 37, used Instagram to announce he was quitting.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons Den star Peter Jones in a rage by withdrawing from the lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last moments - to focus on her incredible new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was shocked when the successful TV lady admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at her business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new offer - worth up to £1.5 million - meant she had no time to devote household goods and accessories from the Truly brand.
The business has been likened to the Goop brand owned by Gwyneth Paltrow and is expected to double Willoughby's fortune of £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce he was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his vacation homes.
The source said: "Throughout this time, Truly has become Holly's priority.
It will be his long-term future that can witness him through the next few decades.
The decision to pull out all those involved was truly shocking.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, it's so close to launch.
There's a warehouse full of stuff at Marlow's headquarters ready to sell".
Experts believe the departure of This Morning's host, who is among the most acceptable stars in the British banking industry, could hurt the multi-million-dollar firm due to massive investments in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and household items, and potentially delay its launch.
And it could be the end of that friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three and husband Dan Baldwin has been friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined him as chairman in March.
The couple vacationed together and Jones owned a 40% stake in Baldwin, a TV production firm.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as ITV's lawyer on I'm A Celebrity.
Sources close to Jones said last night "We will not comment on his business affairs".
A firm conversation and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism that would be received by the news media for making comments that would be considered "unfair to the president" and very positive about the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump so giving up on losing?
Trump said in a low voice to the news readers.
"I never give up on losing".
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after their initial meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a major step towards halting North Korea's nuclear program.
But the negotiations to stop the nuclear program were delayed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a "similar response" from the United States to the North's initial ceasefire movement.
On the contrary, he said, the U.S. continued sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a more optimistic view in his speech.
"We have good relations with North Korea", he said.
"We're going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
Now we have a great relationship".
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results - ending rocket tests, helping free hostages, and bringing the bodies of American soldiers back to the homeland first.
And he defended his extraordinary approach in talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we're going to have about 200 people standing there", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him directly.
Indonesian Tsunami and Earthquake Destroy Islands, Killing Hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs said they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been evacuated, no national disaster has been declared, as a condition for the mobilization of international aid.
"In many situations, unfortunately, they obviously do not ask for international help, so it is quite challenging", Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children teamed up to Palu, it was unclear whether foreign staff could work on the scene.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Based on the frequent earthquakes that Indonesia faces, the country remains unprepared for natural disasters.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, it is not a common sight on other coastal areas.
The lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, despite the warning being in effect, is like contributing to the loss of life.
At its best, traveling between the islands in Indonesia is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat the earthquake victims was heading to Palu, but it took at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo has made poor infrastructure improvements a top priority in his election campaign, and he has allocated high allowances on roads and railways.
But the lack of funds has plagued Jokowi's administration as he faces re-election next year.
Jokowi faced pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim majority members have accepted a more conservative religious understanding.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes because Christian and Muslim groups fought in the streets, using spears, bows and arrows, and other weapons.
See: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge equals against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea by scoring a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a delivery from Xherdan Shaqiri on about 30 laps from Chelsea's goal with his team leading 1-0.
He kicked the ball left before kicking it into a long-range goal line.
The test flew high above the goal as it floated towards the top right corner of the net.
Finally the ball fell on Arrizabalaga who jumped and fell into the net.
"It's just trying to get into that position, to get the ball and players like Shaq always take the ball as far as possible, so I try to pass as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and make a match and not think long and make a punch on".
Chelsea took a 1-0 lead in the half after gaining the net in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues forward sent the ball back to Mateo Kovacic in the game, before slipping into the middle of the field and running into Liverpool's centre.
Kovacic gives and delivers can quickly in the middle.
He then kicked a beautiful kick, taking Hazard into the goal.
The danger of passing the defense and scoring a goal away with a left foot kick over Liverpool player Alisson Becke.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Indonesian tsunami death toll increased to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday morning.
Many people were reportedly trapped under the rubble of buildings that were hit by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake that hit Friday and triggered waves as high as 20 feet, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
Palu City, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is filled with debris from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a man, 32, on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with a graft impact at Grayson Mews on John Street, with a 32-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged the people in the area who see or hear anything to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still in its early stages but I would urge anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who sees or hears anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also urge anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the dashboard footage to contact us because they may have information that is important to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and she was found inside her home.
In the evening, friends who believed they knew the woman arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Police said an investigation is underway, they're in the process of informing the victim's heir.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to break into his apartment but was told by police no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He gets cluttered when he finds out what's going on.
Residents were told the investigation took hours before they were allowed back in.
A police officer told a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman showed up at the scene crying.
He kept repeating it so horrible.
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were inside the cordon and another van was outside.
Several officers are standing inside the cordon monitoring the share block.
Anyone with information is requested to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or call Crimestoppers by cloud name at 0800 555 111 citing log 247 from September 30.
The Cromwell Statue of Parliament is the latest monument to the 'rewrite history'
Its removal would be poetic justice for the destruction such as its Taliban with so much of the artificially-crafted culture and religion of England perpetrated by its fanatical Puritans.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "stupid" and "trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It is inevitable in the current debate that the removal of the statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Palace of Westminster would be the target of.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil War was either not directed or conducted by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of Thomas' ancestor in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's beautiful representation of Cromwella was evidence of 19th century history and a part of the figure that many believed was still worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was widely regarded, more so in the late 19th century than he is today, as a parliamentary defender of external pressure, in his situation of course of monarchy.
Whether it is a full representation is a subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-17th century conflicts shaped the next development of our country, and Cromwell was an individual known as the figure representing a divided division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration".
Pig slaughtered Chinese farmers
A farmer was attacked and killed by pigs in a market in southwest China, local media reports said.
The man, known by his family name "Yuan", was found dead with a ruptured artery, filled with blood near a market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject a vaccine into pigs on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next day, his cousin found him dead, and found a pig door next door open.
He said in the pigsty was a big male pig with a bloody mouth.
Forensic examination confirmed that a 550-pound pig had slapped the farmer to death, according to the report.
"his family", Wu said, as quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the store at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Newsnight that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking others, while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with critical injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig stuck a Welsh farmer in his tractor until his wife chased the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by a pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not always aggressive but the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
They're just playing.
They're nipples, very curious... they're not out to hurt you.
You just have to pay the right amount of respect,' he said.
Tropical Storm Rosa has brought heavy rain to the southwest of the United States.
As predicted, Typhoon Rosa weakened as it moved into cold water waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rainfall in northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 85 mph, Category 1 hurricanes, until 5 a.m. eastern time on Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trench began to form in the Pacific Ocean and move eastward toward the U.S. West Coast As Rosa approached the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it began to push the tropics northward toward the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture interacts with the approaching trenches that create heavy rainfall in the Southwest the next day.
Inland, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flooding, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates to approach 2 to 3 inches per hour in places, particularly in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Two to four inches of rain is expected in the southwest, especially more than Arizona.
The flash floods may be in dire condition due to the tropical rainfall.
It is highly recommended to venture into the desert with the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rain could cause canyons to creep into the river and thunderstorms that would carry the country with strong winds and dust blowing.
The approaching crane will bring heavy rain to the coastal part of Southern California.
Over half an inch of rainfall is likely to occur, which can cause small debris flows and slippery streets.
This is the first rainfall in the region in the dry season.
Some tropical rainfall will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before it gets further down late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and last on Wednesday.
In October we can see some severe temperature changes across the U.S. as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics stay slightly warmer.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There's a great example of a temperature difference through the center of the US on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the summer heat will be trying to build and expand again.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to see a warm start to October with the 80s extending from the Southern Plains to the Northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is an estimate of 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows a high chance of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. through the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people witnessed a shocking testimony on Thursday by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of the alleged sexual assault that took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued, with broadcasters disrupting the usual schedule for last-minute touches on Friday: an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh was stalking him and trying to unbutton his dress at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his statement, said that 100 percent sure as hell didn't happen.
It's probably over 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday watching it.
The company calculated the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures are not immediately available for other networks that show PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring people watching in an office.
To put it in perspective, that's the size of the audience equal to a football game or an Academy Award.
Fox News Channel, which argued that the hosts had supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers listening throughout the day, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.89 million and CNN has 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The benefits remain high after listening.
Flake is the main character in this Friday drama.
After a moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being yelled at by protesters as he attempted to board an elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood up with a disabled eye for a few minutes as he preached, aired live on CNN.
"I stand here before you", said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country??
She was told, "You have power when many women do not have power".
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator was shut down, he would have a lot to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks all covered the live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee voted to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would see charges against the nominee next week, the Democratic minority urges.
Flake is confident of a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and a few senators after that, Flake made a decision.
This Flake choice does have power, because it's clear the Republicans won't have a vote to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'playing politics' on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with him on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson stressed his alleged attack as Checkers for Brexit, saying Britain's and the EU's proposals to pool their respective tariffs were "absolutely absurd".
Police arrested Dyteon Simpson suspect in the death of an LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed on two counts of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the mirrors from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to Wayde's physical shooting.
The bond was set at $350,000, the attorney reports.
The East Baton Rouge Coroner's Office released a report early Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department credits the Louisiana State Police's hunting teams, the state police's crime lab, the Southern University Police Department and local residents with assisting in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement for "hard work and efforts to bring justice".
Sims is 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds a game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"This is what you're worried about all the time", Wade said.
Volcanoes explode in Mexico City
Dust is pouring from the Popocatepetl volcano to the southern part of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after increased activity in the crater and it recorded 183 24-hour gas and dust emissions.
The center monitors various earthquakes and quakes.
Images on social media show a thin layer of car windshield covered in ash in residential areas in Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity in the volcano located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook Central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan understanding followers ahead of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and thousands joined the demonstration to mark the first anniversary of the polarized Catalonia split elections.
A group of masked separatists held by riot police pulled them out with eggs and released paint powder, creating dark clouds on the streets frequented by tourists.
There was also a fight later with the police using their sticks to fight.
Hours later pro-independence groups chanted "No forgetting, no forgiveness" in the face of unionist protesters shouting, "Life in Spain".
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries in the protests, local media reported.
Tensions remained high in the region of independence a year after the October 1 referendum was declared illegal by Madrid but welcomed by the Catalans' separatists.
Voters voted entirely to be independent, although the percentage of out voters was low with those opposed to the split largely boycotting the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop elections taking place at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups camped last Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the state police.
The demonstration went on but had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separation protest with his wife, said he no longer hopes for Catalonia's prospects of independence.
"Last year we went through one of the best moments of our lives.
I saw my parents crying joyfully because they were able to vote but now we're stuck", she said.
Although management is crucial if we are to approach victory in the regional elections last December, the pro-independence Catalan party has struggled to maintain momentum this year with many of their prominent leaders either in exile or in prison awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded protests against police support on her phone, said the conflict had been voiced by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting tense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial jail since the end of last year, announced he would contest next year's European Parliament elections.
"Competing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression in democratic values and the repression we see from the Spanish government", he said.
Man arrested after house hit by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after the same car hit a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused by the door and the building itself.
The A-crossbow may also have fired a shot at the car at some point.
The Mena attack gave Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston is a win.
Livingston's rise surprised the Rangers to hand Steven Gerrard to second-place defeat in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Mena's attack proved so effective when Gary Holt's team moved up to Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team remained unbeaten in the Premiership this season and faced the head of Hearts, whom they will be beating by eight points, next Sunday.
Prior to that, Rangers hosted the Vienna Rapid in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended the unbeaten run in this division to six games, with head coach Holt still feeling a loss since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston missed his chance against the opposing team.
Holt's team should have been way ahead of the game before scoring, with their involvement causing the Rangers to face all the trouble.
Scott Robinson broke it but gave up his goal-scoring effort, but Alan Lithgow was only able to give up his effort after slipping into Craig Halkett's corner.
The hosts were eager to let the Rangers play in front of them, realizing they could cause trouble for the opponents with the set cut.
And that's the way the big goal is.
Rangers admitted a free kick and Livingston opened the curtains, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to set up Menga, who took the touch and goal line from the center of the box.
At that point, the Rangers had taken possession but found the home defense unable to penetrate goalkeeper Liam Kelly largely untouched,
The pattern continued into the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to rescue him.
Scott Pittman was dismissed by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow scored from another match against Livingston.
Crosses continued to get into Livingston's box and continued to clean up, while two penalty claims - after Halkett's challenge to replacement Glenn Middleton, and one to the handball - leaped far.
'Fenomena' from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A remarkable achievement and a result for Livingston.
For men, they're so brilliant, they're still exceeding expectations on this ascending trajectory.
Their playing style and staff have barely changed since returning to the top flight, but the big credit had to go to Holt for him to launch the team since he arrived.
He has many heroes.
Captain Halkett was very brave, creating a great, orderly defense, while Mena kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the toes.
The Rangers are less inspired, though.
Good as they are sometimes under Gerrard, they fall far short of that standard.
The last ball was rather short - only once did they cut the home team- and it was a call for the Rangers to wake up, who found themselves at the middle table.
Erdogan is receiving a wide-ranging reception in Cologne
There was a smile and blue sky on Saturday (September 29) as the Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at improving relations with NATO allies.
They discussed issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's participation in the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many close supporters wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - most of them Kurds - also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The resistance to war depicts the part of a visitor who is hailed as a hero by some Turks and fired as an autocrat by others.
Deptford road accident: Cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a collision involving a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and paramedics came, but the man died at the scene.
The incident came months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run on Childers Road, about a mile from the Saturday crash.
Metropolitan police said officers were trying to identify the man and inform his heirs.
Road closures and bus stops in the area and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in the riot
Six prison officials were injured in the riots at a high-security male prison, the Bureau of Prisons said.
The disturbance occurred at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at about 09:30 BST on Sunday and is ongoing.
The Tornado Specialist Officer has been brought in to handle the disruption, which involves eight occupants and has one wing.
Officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A Prison Service spokesperson said: "A trained prison staff has been assigned to deal with the ongoing incidents at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We don't tolerate the violence in our prisons, and they're obviously responsible for referring the police and spending more time behind bars".
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison governor received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, a riot police officer was called to the prison to handle a serious disorder where staff were attacked with a pool ball.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flash flooding
It's rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's what might happen next week when the wind energy tracks of Hurricane Rosa cross the Southwest Desert, the risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued flash flood watches for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take the route over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late last night in heavy rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that only "ten tropical storms have remained storm or depressive status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border".
The latest model from the National Hurricane Center predicts 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with isolated amounts as high as 6 inches in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas in the Desert Southwest including the center of the Rockies and the Great Basin will likely get 1 to 2 inches, with the remote total up to possibly 4 inches.
For those at risk of flash flooding, the rain of Rosa may be a blessing since the region was hit by drought.
While flooding is a serious concern, some have said that rainfall will benefit since the Southwest is now in a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Bureau, more than 40 percent of Arizona experiences the worst, second highest category of drought", reported weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to the mainland on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, having a strong Sunday morning storm with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving north at 12 mph.
The storm faced cold waters in the Pacific and thus made landfall.
So, it is expected to crumble in Mexico at the strength of a tropical storm in the evening or evening on Monday.
Rain across Mexico could be heavy, causing a major flood risk.
"A rainfall of 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, possibly up to 10 inches", reports weather.com.
Rosa will trace northward across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, then tracing through Arizona and south to Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main expected hazard from Rosa or tornadoes is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Southwest desert", says the National Hurricane Center.
The rain is expected to produce life-threatening flash floods and debris flows in the desert, and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests and attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man was found with injuries in Somerset.
The teen was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where he remained in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested yesterday in the Radstock, Avon and Somerset area, police said.
The officer appealed to those who may have cell phone records of what happened to come forward.
Trump said Kavanaugh was "suffering, meaningless, angry" with the Democratic Party
"Judge Kavanaugh's vote was a vote to reject the brutal and excessive tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffered very badly, angry" from the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying accusations from Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her during a decade-long teenage outbreak.
Ford also testified at the hearing on his charges.
The president said Saturday "the American people saw Kavanaugh's excellence and quality and courage on that day".
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh was a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an outstanding record in public service", he told the crowd in support of West Virginia.
The president simultaneously referred to Kavanaugh's candidacy as he discussed the importance of the Republican nomination in the umums.
"Five weeks from now, one of the most important elections in our lives.
I didn't run, but I really ran", he said.
"That's why I'm in the place of fighting for the right candidate".
Trump argued that Democrats were on a mission to "opposing and preventing".
The first major procedure in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to be done no later than Friday, the GOP's senior aide's leadership has told CNN.
Hundreds were killed in the earthquake in Indonesia, tsunami, with toll numbers rising
At least 384 people were killed, many swept away by the giant wave that hit the coast, when a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a celebration on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when a six-meter (18-foot) high wave hit the land at dusk, wiping out many deaths and destroying everything in their path.
Tsunami followed by an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude.
"When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still doing activities on the beach and not running and eventually they became victims", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian disaster recovery agency BNPB in a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come on its own, it dragged cars, bullets, houses, it hit its own beaches on land", said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the shore.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people have been transferred to 24 centres in Paluu.
Aerial images released by the disaster agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges spinning and collapsing and a mosque surrounded by water.
The final shaking continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
Several aftershocks were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Research and Implementation Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the powerful earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city, which sits at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami wave, the agency said.
Nugroho described the destruction as "meluas" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of the building and said another 540 people were injured and 29 people were still missing.
Nugroho said the deaths and destruction could be more terrible along the 300 km (190 miles) coastline north of Palu, an area called Donggala.
Communications are completely cut off without any information from Donggala, said Nugroho.
"More than 300,000 people live there", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected area.
"It's a tragedy but it could be worse", the Red Cross said.
The agency was heavily criticized last Saturday for not reporting that the tsunami had hit Palu despite officials saying the tsunami occurred within the period of the warning.
In an amateur video posted on social media, a man's voice on the roof of a building screams at people on the street about the tsunami.
Within minutes, a tsunami wave swept the coast and dragged buildings and cars along.
Reuters has not been able to confirm the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive power leak that cut off communications around Palu and this made it difficult for authorities to carry out search efforts.
The military has sent aid by cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities but the displaced population still needs more food and other basic necessities, authorities said.
The city's airport has been reopened for relief efforts only and it will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the transfer centre in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 800.
It's a very nasty situation.
While World Vision staff from Donggala had made it safely to Palu city, they passed through the disaster area.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed", he said.
She's in a very bad condition.
Although the relief teams began providing disaster relief in a grim atmosphere, some said foreign aid workers with deep experience were prevented from heading to Palu.
According to Indonesian rules, financing, supplies of supplies and removal of workers from abroad can only be carried out if disaster areas are declared national disaster zones.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the provincial level", said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
When the government says, "OK, this is a national disaster", then we can get help from abroad but for now there is no status.
As the second night approaches in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami last Friday, friends and families of the missing hope that their loved ones will be miraculously turned into a miracle that will make them cry out of sadness.
On Saturday, a boy was found inside the fort.
On Sunday, rescue teams rescued a woman trapped under a rock collapse for two days with her mother's body lying next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national rowing team, has trained two parachutists who were missing from the quake for the Asian Games which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, Mr. Mandagi said.
"As a senior in the field of sprinting, I have my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr Gendon shared how he was eager to send WhatsApp messages to the participants of the Palu beach festival after hours of news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel spread among the roa community.
The text message sent had only one grey font as opposed to two blue ones.
"I don't think the message got through", he said.
Thieves robbed $26,750 while refilling ATMs in Newport on the Levee
Thieves stole $26,750 from Brink employees who were cashing at the Newport on the Levee ATM last Friday, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
Brink's employees emptied the ATMs at the entertainment complex and were prepared to send more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While Brink's employees were busy doing their jobs, a man ran to his back and stole a bag full of money.
Witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene based on the report, but police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about the robbery in question should contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Announcing the change of name on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "This man is officially known as Kanye West.
Kanye West, 41, was nicknamed Ye for a while and he used that nickname as the title of his sixth album released in June.
The turning point came during her appearance on Saturday Night Live where she is expected to release her latest album Yandhi.
She replaced singer Ariana Grande who cancelled her appearance on the show due to emotional issues, the show's creator said.
Kanye West previously said that the name had religious meaning and was also an abbreviation of his current professional name.
I believe ye is a common word found in the Gospels and it means you, Kanye West said earlier this year when discussing the title of his album with Big Boy radio host.
So I am you, and I am us, and we are us.
It's changing from Kanye meaning just one, to Ye-- an image of our good, bad and misguided and everything.
The album is more of a reflection of our own true image.
He's one of the famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs is known by various names such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
Kanye West's former partner, JAY-Z, can also receive it without or with a shortcut and capital letters.
President of Mexico, AMLO vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed not to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody student retaliation.
AMLO pledged in Plaza Tlatelolco on Saturday that it would never use the military to curb Mexicans.
The military fired on civilians who were holding a peaceful demonstration in the plaza on October 2, 1968 that had caused 300 civilian deaths as the left-wing student movement began to take hold across Latin America.
AMLO vowed to support Mexican youth by providing monthly subsidies to those who are studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to become involved in criminal gangs.
The United States should double the AI fund.
"The United States should double the amount of funding in artificial intelligence as China becomes more active in the field", said AI investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The view was made after the US government made an announcement about artificial intelligence despite the US itself as a whole lacking an official artificial intelligence strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its role last year with a goal of becoming the number one AI innovator by 2030.
"Doubling the allocation of AI research is a good start, as all other countries are way behind the United States and we want to make the next big breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
"By doubling the funding could increase the chances of the next big artificial intelligence (AI) achievement in the United States", Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee's book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcout, CEO of Sinovation Ventures who has invested in one of China's most well-known companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that had defeated the top-ranked American Othello player while still a student at Carnegie Mellon University. Later, he became an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee recognized earlier U.S. government technology competitions such as the Robot Challenge from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and wanted to know when the next competition would be held so he could identify new talent.
"Researchers in the United States usually have to work hard to win government aid", Lee said.
"It's not China that takes academic leaders but corporate companies", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have recruited great talent from universities to work in artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that a change in immigration policy could also help the United States support its artificial intelligence efforts.
"I think the green card should be automatically offered to PhDs in artificial intelligence", he said.
The State Council of China issued the Future Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in academic institutions. It matches the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations allocate funding to US researchers but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center that aims to bring together partners from industry and academia.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, a U.S. bill that attempted to create the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has been seen as unenforceable for the past few months.
The Macedonians voted to change the name of the country
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday to decide on the name change to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece in which Greece has prevented Macedonia from joining the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
Greece, which has its own territory called Macedonia, insisted that the name Macedonia represents a claim to its territory and has vetoed to reject Macedonia's participation in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement on a proposed name change in June but the nationalist opposition said the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the mostly Slavonic Macedonian population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the vote and the inauguration raised doubts whether the vote would reach the minimum number of 50 percent votes needed to legitimize the vote.
The question on the ballot paper is written: Do you agree to NATO and EU membership by accepting an agreement with Greece?
Supporters of the name change include Prime Minister Zoran Zaev who said Accepting the new name is a price to pay for joining the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country and for the young people of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the European Union because that means our lives are safer", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79 in Skopje.
Although illegal on the legal side, the MPs said they would abide by the vote to make it final.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The country's election commission said there were no reports of irregularities occurring until 1 p.m.
However, turnout was 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the 2016 parliamentary election after 66 percent of registered voters removed ballots.
"I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife and their son Dushko cast ballots in Macedonia for a name change that would pave the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the EU in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was setting up a small stage and laying chairs in front of the tents set up by those who boycotted the referendum.
"We want to join NATO and the EU but we want to join with pride rather than this way", Kavadarkov said.
We are poor people but we have dignity.
If they don't want to see us as Macedonians, we can turn to China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would provide sufficient investment to Macedonia where its unemployment rate exceeds 20 percent.
I believe the vast majority will accept because more than 80 percent of our population votes for the EU and NATO", Zaev said after casting the ballot.
He said the decision is the confirmation of our future.
A poll was published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Studies which said between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the vote - below the required number.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian TV Telma, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they'd vote yes.
For a ballot to be successful, the number of voters who come must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The vote's failure will be seen as the first serious blow to pro-Western government policy since taking office in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City navigates through the entire Brighton defence line to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were sent to defend Brighton at Manchester City and won 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look extremely happy on his net in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attackers received a delivery in the middle of the field at the start of the order.
He raced between Brighton's three defenses, before cutting into the open field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four players in green.
He pushed a defender before chasing a few more people on the edge of Brighton's box.
Then he pushed the left-hand drive, looking for Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right-handed boot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a one-stroke right-handed kick.
"Aguero is struggling with his foot problems", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at that time".
But Sterling gave the Sky Blues an early lead in the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball in the Brighton area for the match.
He made a beautiful passing ball through the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few touches before leading Sterling into a long position.

Scherzer wants to play the Rockies.
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there's not much reason to force another start.
But the highly competitive Scherzer hoped to face the Fort on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there were any implications of playing out for the Rockies, who hold a game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies embraced at least a special opportunity spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but were still looking to lock in their first division championship.
"Even if we were just playing, at least we could know the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and the other teams would be playing maybe at the highest level I'd be facing this year.
Why don't I want to compete in that?"
The Nationals have yet to announce a rookie for Sunday, but are reportedly likely to allow Scherzer to make a run in the situation.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, is holding a warm-up session on Thursday and will be making a runner-up on his usual Sunday break.
The right-handed batter from Washington is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump rally in West Virginia
The president by not directly referring to the situation around the Supreme Court elected Brett Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of the Republican turnout coming in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done will be at stake in November.
Five weeks to face the most important election of our lives.
I don't fight but I fight very hard and that's why I'm everywhere fighting for a great candidate, he said.
Trump continued, "You see this terrible Democratic radical group, you see it's happening right now.
And they are determined to take back power by whatever means, you see, cruelty, evil.
And they will not care who they will hurt, nor who they will overthrow; and what they will have, we will not give them.
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to stop and hinder.
"And you've seen that for the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats angry, mean and untrue".
He referred the Senate Judiciary Committee to the position of Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, who had received a strong boo from the audience.
"Remember his answer?
Did you leak the documents?
Uh, uh, what.
No, I'm waiting for one -- that's the worst body language I've ever seen".
Workers are no longer a large church.
It's intolerable for anyone to express their views.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it didn't go up.
After all, I'm the latest in the line of the Labour AP being told we're not welcome - all because of our views.
My fellow parliamentarian Joan Ryan received almost the same treatment because she supported anti-Semitism.
In my case, the criticism movement has criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
In terms of responsibility for economic policy, for national security, for Europe, which ironically is a question that is almost identical to what Jeremy disagreed with his previous leaders.
The notice of the meeting for the Nottingham East Labour Party on Friday said that "we want an all-inclusive and productive meeting".
For almost eight years of my time as the local Labour AP, the GC meeting on Friday night was really about all that.
Sadly, today, it's not the tone of many political meetings and promises. Better, softer.
It is becoming increasingly clear that differences of opinion are unacceptable within the Labour Party and that any opinion will be judged whether it is accepted by the party leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, as a colleague who before, I think, shared almost the same political views began to expect me to make a U-turn and take a position that I would not agree with - whether it be on national security or the EU single market.
When I speak out - and no matter what I say - then it's followed by accusations of abuse on social media, being told not to vote, denouncing political centers, telling me to leave the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know I'm luckier than my colleagues because comments against me are more political.
I was impressed by the professionalism and perseverance of my colleagues who were being rained on by the sexist and racist swearing-in every day but never gave up.
One of the political disappointments of this era is how the level of abuse has become commonplace.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn called for Labour to cultivate cultural tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer a broad church and with every motion of no confidence or change in election rules, the party gets narrower.
I've received a lot of advice over the last two years telling me to shut up, not stand out too much and then I'll be okay.
But that's not what I wanted to do in politics.
Since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a schoolboy, raised by the Thatcher government's neglect that let my entire graduating class down, I've tried to lead a better public service to those in dire need - whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I never hid my politics, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could possibly be confused about my position and the contrasting part with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, what I want to say is that when a country rejects Brexit, it will affect our homes, businesses and public services, I don't understand the feeling of wasting my time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But the only message I have is that it's not to the Nottingham Momentum, it's to my constituents, whether Labour or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that any unselected threat or political appropriateness will not prevent me from acting in what I believe is in your best interests.
Chris Leslie is the AP for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38-17 Melrose: The unmatched Ayr climbs to the top
Two slow tries may have made the final decision, but Ayr no doubt deserved to win this exciting and entertaining Tennent Premiership match.
They're now at the top of the table, the only one that's never lost out on 10 people.
Finally, their superior defense, how much they took the opportunity, made the home team and coach Peter Murchie happy.
"We've been tested on our game so far, and we're still unbeaten, so I must be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Congratulations to Ayr, they took a better chance than we did".
Grant Anderson made the attempt in the 14th minute, conversion by Frazier Climo, putting Ayr ahead, but, a yellow card for Scotland captain Rory Hughes, issued for the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to make the net and Jason Baggot to capture the unconverted attempt.
Climo led Ayr on penalties, before, at half-time, he scored a point then a solo conversion attempt to make it 17-5 to Ayr at break.
But Melrose got off to a good start in the second season and Patrick Anderson's attempt, a conversion by Baggot, narrowed the gap to five points.
There was a long delay due to serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was taken out, and from the start, Ayr continued onwards again through the trial of Stafford McDowall, converted by Climo.
The captain's replacement Ayr Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card, and again, Melrose retaliated with an extra player by unconverted Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of intense pressure.
The home team returned, however, and when Struan Hutchinson was awarded a yellow card for his unballistic tackle Climo, from the outside of the penalty line, MacPherson broke the back of the lead hitting Ayr.
The climate of the conversion, as he did almost like a restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up a box kick from David Armstrong and sent off flanker Gregor Henry for the fifth try of the home team.
Still Game stars are seen to be ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran was seen to be ready to move into the hospitality industry after he was named as a director for a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old starred as Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, where he wrote and starred alongside longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair have announced that the upcoming ninth series is the last in the series, and it appears Kiernan is planning a lifetime after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actress declined to comment on the story, although Scottish Sun sources suggested Kiernan wanted to get involved in the thriving restaurant business.
'The ocean is ours': Bolivia, surrounded by land, hopes the courts will reopen the Pacific
The naval guard at the naval headquarters in La Paz.
The public building beams the sea blue flag.
The naval base from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon is inscribed with the motto: 'The ocean is our real property.
To recover is a responsibility".
Throughout the landlocked Bolivia, the memory of losing the coast to Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century is still clear - like a longing to sail the Pacific Ocean once again.
That hope is perhaps the highest of the century, as Bolivia is still awaiting a decision from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and calm, and of course hopes for a positive outcome", said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ's ruling on the big screen across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will back Bolivia's claims - after centuries of negotiations - Chile is forced to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president - who faces a controversial race for re-election next year - also has a lot of interest in Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean", he vowed in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court will not make a decision in favor of Bolivia - and if it does a little bit it will change a lot.
The UN agency based in the Netherlands has no power to award the area to Chile, and has determined that it will not decide the outcome of possible negotiations.
Regarding the ICJ's decision coming out just six months after the final argument was heard, the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, Chilean expert on international law.
And not to slow down Bolivia's policy any more, for the last four years there may be obstacles.
"The issue of access to the sea has now been seized by the Bolivian administration", said Zárate.
Morales's rhetorical hostility has diminished that little Chilean compassion, he suggests.
Bolivia and Chile at some point will continue to talk, but it will be too difficult to have a discussion afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that court decisions were usually quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a great opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of conflict for the common good", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most prominent presidents - was using maritime issues as political aid.
"Bolivia has never lost its right to access the Pacific Ocean directly", he added.
"This decision is an opportunity to see that we need to forget the past".
North Korea says a nuclear ceasefire won't happen unless it trusts the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would not have a nuclear disarmament before if it didn't trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to implement the pledges made during the summit in Singapore between rival leaders.
His comments came as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to want to restart a stalled nuclear diplomacy more than three months after Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was a dream that the continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War would cause North Korea to surrender.
Washington is careful to agree to a declaration without Pyongyang first making a major ceasefire move.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about launching weapons seen as the only way to ensure its national security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month in preparation for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris Fashion Show introduces the latest design of a large headgear on its way to the main street near you.
If you want to add to your hat collection or block out the sunlight completely, then you don't have to look far.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a variety of large-sized bizarre headgear for their SS19 collection on the fashion stage that embellished the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
The impractical hat has swept Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their humiliating designs to the fashion scene.
A prominent design by Valentino was a magnificent water-yellow hat decorated with thick, synthetic fur covering the model's head.
Other large-sized accessories include jewel-decorated pottery, smart hats and even silk - but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a strange choice of masks - and the perfect time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were sewn on his lips and more resembled Hannibal Lecter's elegant dress.
One design resembles a scuba diving gear equipped with a snorkel and goggles, while the other looks like a melting ice cream cone.
And if you stick with the big fashion reality -- you're in luck.
Style watchers predict that a very large bonnet may be heading to the main road near you.
A large-sized hat is warm from 'La Bomba', a straw hat with a full two-foot width has been seen worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The label king behind the highly impractical hat has been touted on social media sending another big design to the stage - a straw beach bag almost as big as the model that folds the bathing suit he wears.
The burnt orange raffle bag, decorated with a sticky raffle and added a white holder, is prominently featured in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I'm looking forward to seeing the big hats and beach bags arrive on the main road for the coming summer - because designers have made a huge impact and it's hard to let the demand for large-sized accessories go".
John Edward: Language skills are very important to global citizens.
Scottish private schools maintain record performance for academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding test results, reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, the arts, music and other community endeavors.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, the school, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strives to provide the best possible service to their students and parents.
The goal of private schools is to prepare their students for higher education, their chosen careers, and their place as global citizens.
As a sector of education that they can and implement the earlier school curriculum, we see modern languages continue to be popular and subject choices are sought after in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in a language they understand, it goes into their head.
If you talk to him in his mother tongue, it will go into his heart".
This is a strong warning that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's exams, we can see that language is the top subject in the league table with the highest graduation rate in private schools.
68 percent of students who learn a foreign language have a higher grade.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS school members, showed that 72 percent of students achieved higher A grades in Mandarin, while 72 percent of them learned German, 69 percent of them learned French and 63 percent of them learned Spanish also got A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign languages as an important skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language now, as an elective subject, is being held in the same way as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects are in the curriculum of private schools and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK's Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that the reasons employers struggle to fill the gap, 17 per cent linked to a lack of language skills.
And so, time and again, language skills become a necessity to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more prospective job opportunities requiring language, these skills are essential in this global world.
Whatever career a person chooses, if they learn a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future by having lifelong skills like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put someone who speaks multiple languages ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov poll of over 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough for conversation, with French being the language of conversation used by only two digits of the percentage, 15 percent.
This is why investing in language teaching today is so important for children today.
Having multiple languages, especially in developing countries, will equip children with better opportunities to find meaningful work.
In Scotland, every school will be different in the language they learn.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are seen as very important for the UK looking ahead in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there's always a lot of languages to choose from in private schools, with a staff of teachers who are experts in that area.
Scottish private schools are dedicated to providing an environment of learning that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever happens in the future.
There's no denying that at this time, in a global business environment, that language continues to be very important to the future of our country, so this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered as the "skill of international communication".
Private schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
I must be well le faire.
John Edward is the Director of the Council of Scottish Private Schools
LeBron will make his first Lakers appearance on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego.
But how many minutes he'll play is yet to be determined.
"It'll be more than one and less than 48 minutes", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers announcer Mike Trudell has warned that James may be playing in a few minutes.
Following training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for a six-game schedule before the Lakers season.
"I don't need a preseason game to be ready at this stage of my career", he said.
Trump rally time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a rush rally campaign tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It was Trump's first of five rallies scheduled next week, including stops in friendly locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote held for him to vote to fill a vacancy on the Federal Court, Trump aims to win support for the upcoming midterm election as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the vote is decided in Nov.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight, and how do you watch it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online via a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to handle this week's trial for Federal Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been strained over sexual misconduct charges with Senate confirmation that he is expected to be held for a week during the FBI investigation.
But the primary goal of this hastily organized rally was to help Republicans gain momentum in the run-up to the November election.
So President Trump's campaign said the five meetings next week are a "reconciliation of volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Congress leadership is so critical to his agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible in our busy campaign season", a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Scheduled at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, this evening's rally could bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw coverage from Pittsburgh media, " according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump has visited West Virginia in the past month, a state he won with more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is trailing him in the election.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to support him", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show the courage to fight to keep hope alive heading to singles on Sunday
After three games of a tie, Saturday night's corner game is probably what the Ryder Cup needs this time.
Swing momentum is a concept of sport that is a creation but it is really believed by the players, and even more so in a competition like this.
So where do you think the momentum is now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now it's four points, so we're bringing a little momentum, I guess", said Jordan Spieth as he walked at the end of the day.
Europe has obviously an advantage, four points ahead with twelve points to go.
American players, as Spieth put it, feel they have a little bit of a edge and a sense of motivation, not just from Spieth and Justin Thomas playing together all day and each one having three out of four points.
Spieth exhibited the game from start to finish in the green and set an example for other players.
The vivid shouts were getting louder as he continued to roll, making a significant slide to match the four points when he and Thomas missed after two points.
His kick that gave them victory on the 15th hole was greeted with the same cheers, which tells you that he believes the American team is still fighting.
"You just have to work harder and worry about your own game", Spieth said.
That's all there is for all these players right now.
18 holes to show power.
The only two players with more points than Spieth and Thomas two days ago were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable story in the Ryder Cup.
A pair of different players are attractive from this European country but they're four points clear of four and they don't seem to make any mistakes.
"Moliwood" is the only couple that doesn't do bogies on Saturday nights, but they also avoid bogies on Saturday morning, Friday night and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
The period and the way their energy was provided and demonstrated by the supporters was proof that they were players to be defeated on Sunday, and no player was more popular to block the possibility of a European victory during the sunset at Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
It's best they're both in different holes.
However, the conversation about the European team's victory is too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson facilitated the work of Sergio Garcia, the four-player hero this morning, when he was compared to Alex Noren.
One bogi and two doubles in the first nine holes swapped the Spanish player and the Swedish player.
However, on Sunday, no one can help you.
Four balls and four players are very interesting to watch more closely because of the interaction between the pair, the advice given and not given and the strategy that can change in a blink of an eye.
Europe played better as a team so far and led far on the final day but these four sessions also showed Team USA had the courage previously questioned by many, including local fans.
European team lead 10-6 to the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe brought a comfortable lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after rising from a four-ball and four-player game with a score of 10-6 over the United States.
Two great players, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two wins over Tiger Woods who were struggling to bring their victory at Le Golf National to four points.
The European team led by Thomas Bjorn were trying to retain the trophy they seized at Hazeltine two years ago, dominating the mistaken American team in the morning session four balls, with a 3-1 series score.
The U.S. team gave up more competition in four games, won two games, but couldn't close the gap.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points out of 12 in Sunday's singles game to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first new European player to win four consecutive points while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after the sensational weekend were the second pair to win four of their opening four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they then together defeated Woods and new American player Bryson Dechambeau in a 5&4 game.
Woods, who went through two tough matches on Saturday, showed his prowess but has now lost 19 of 29 four-ball and four-player games and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not play a break during the morning four-ball session, returned to match Henrik Stenson in a four-player match to beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka in 2&1 - ranked first and third in the world.
Europe is not lucky on a quiet, relaxed day in southwest Paris.
Three-time major champions, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas became the benchmark for America with two points on Saturday.
They secured a 2&1 victory over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in a four-ball match and then again defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy in a 4&3 in a four-player game that they lost on two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history a team that has missed four points qualifies for a single match, although as defending champions Furyk only need a series to retain the trophy.
After occupying second place for two days, the Sunday counterattack seemed beyond their reach.
North Korea says it's impossible they'll disarm voluntarily without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions had caused their deep distrust of the United States and it was unlikely that their country would voluntarily release nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important humanitarian measures" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, closing nuclear testing sites and pledging not to expand the use of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the US", he said.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and in such a situation, it is impossible for us to disarm easily first".
While Ri has complained to North Korea about Washington's opposition to a "gradual" approach to nuclear termination in which North Korea will be rewarded for taking steps gradually, the reality seems important because it does not reject voluntary refusal as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the president of the United States and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work for the "nuclear termination of the Korean peninsula" while Trump provided assurances to North Korea's security.
North Korea sought an end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said that Pyongyang should first disarm its nuclear weapons.
Washington also refused to follow the suggestion to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
"The US insisted on 'first ceasefire' and increased the level of pressure in the sanctions to achieve their goals by force, and even opposed 'declaration of the end of the war,'" Ri said.
"The perception that restrictions can weaken us is the empty dream of those who do not know us.
But the problem was the constant restrictions that made our distrust worse".
Ri did not mention the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader highlighted during the United Nations conference earlier this week.
The minister only mentioned three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Kim Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the party in this ceasefire issue were South Korea and not the US, the nuclear ceasefire from the Korean peninsula would not find a culmination".
However, Ri's tone of speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the US mainland with North Korean rockets was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump named Kim as a rocket man" in a suicide mission.
This year at a United Nations conference, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said much work remains to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea ends its nuclear program.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have time for this, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argued that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council: "Enforcement of the Security Council's sanctions must continue with earnestness and without failure until we experience a complete, final and affirmative cessation of nuclear weapons".
The Security Council has voted to increase sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to dismantle financing for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said afterwards he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, only for North Korea within hours after it had condemned him for making "gangster-like demands".
North Korea pledged in a meeting with Moon this month to unveil the missile site and also the nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate action".
He said Kim had told him that the "same measures" Kim was looking for were security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and were heading towards normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students have taken courses to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has given all its students more sleep in an effort to combat the growing culture of learning through caffeine-based 'night-long learning'.
One faculty member found that students at the world's number one university often fail to understand the basics of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, prepared a course he believed was the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation during learning.
'At the end of the course, a girl came to me and said: 'Why am I just being told about this now, in my senior year?
He said no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep - and that surprised me", he told The Telegraph.
This course was introduced for the first time this year, explaining to students the need for good sleep habits to help them achieve academic and sporting performance, as well as improve their well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding its students had been sleeping poorly during the week.
The one-hour course involves several interactive tasks.
In one section, there's an image of the dorm room, where students click on a cup of coffee, curtains, coaches and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance is affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of sleep routines.
In another section, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation could increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Campus maps with interactive icons, then encourage participants to think about their daily routines.
'We knew it wouldn't change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke", adds Prof. Czeisler.
A proud culture of 'wake-up all night' still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students means sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Ensuring you have enough sleep quality, it should be the student's 'secret weapon' to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he says - even to avoid gaining weight, because lack of sleep puts the brain in starvation mode, making it hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying physical chemistry and biology, helped Professor Czeisler design this course, having taken his class last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to expand the course throughout the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to complete the same learning program before joining competitive institutions.
Professor Czeisler suggests that students should consider using alarm clocks before and after bed, and be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can impair your circadian rhythm from moving, causing sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Goal of the blood to defeat Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another defeat on the field when Dolly Menga's network tied Steven Gerrard's weak team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
Ibrox were still looking for their first win at home since their 4-1 February win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side gave Gerrard his second defeat in 18 games as manager to cause his side to fall eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership predecessor Hearts.
The mane exploded in the seventh minute before the first half and the Rangers seemed to have no idea how to match the position.
With Rangers now down to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third and was just behind Hibernian by goal difference.
And the Rangers may face further trouble after the lineup closure, Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after the object was thrown from his team's area.
Gerrard made eight substitutions in his side that reached the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup after beating Ayr.
Holt retains the same Livi 11 team that stole a point from Hearts last week and he's certainly happy with the way his team's game is worrying their opponents all the time.
The Rangers may have dominated the game but Livingston made more attempts on goal.
They were supposed to score after only two minutes when Mena's first touch gave Scott Pittman a pass through Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder was lost.
A free kick from the back of Keaghan Jacobs found captain Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only send the ball behind the goal.
The Rangers managed to regain control but it was only hope for the last thirty minutes.
Alfredo Morelos felt he should have been given a penalty kick in the 45th minute when he and Steven Lawless clashed but referee Steven Thomson let the appeal of the Colombian player go.
The Rangers managed to give only two straight attempts in the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily deflected the horns of Lassana Coulibaly and his weak counterpart Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opening goal in the 34th minute may be against the pace of the game, no one can deny their chances.
The Rangers once again failed to face Jacobs' planned move.
Scott Arfield was only stiff when Declan Gallagher dragged the ball to Scott Robinson who calmly sent it to Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard made the switch during the break by switching Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and it almost made an immediate impact when the winger handed the ball to Morelos but the stunning Kelly came out of his race to block.
But Livingston continued to make it difficult for the opposing teams to play the game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett sending away a long delivery.
Holt's team was supposed to widen the gap in the semi-finals but McGregor held out well to deny Jacobs before Lithgow's corner strayed from the goal corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton urged another penalty match as he faced Jacobs but again Thomson ignored him.
Almanac: the creator of the Geiger calculator
And now, a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and THE DAY that physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger Calculator.
As a major science foundation since then, the Geiger counter has become the backbone of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring unknown scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is that?"
Rogers: "It's the Geiger Calculator, used to find radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you wear these earphones, you can actually hear the atomic effects of radioactivity in minerals".
Evans: Yeah, it sounds like it now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the creature that bears his name has endured.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "see" the malignant cells and kill them
Vaccines teach the immune system to identify malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involved is to extract immune cells from the patient, transforming them into a lab.
It can see the protein that's common to many cancer cells and then inject it back into the body.
Trial vaccines have shown positive results for patients with various types of cancer.
A woman treated with a vaccine, which teaches her immune system to recognize malignant cells, recovered from her ovarian cancer after more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from patients, turning them into a lab so they can "see" a protein common to many types of cancer called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our test results show that we have a very good vaccine".
HER2  causes the growth of several cancers", including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, explains Prof. Berzofsky.
The same approach to taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells has been successful in treating these types of leukemia.
Kanye West joins the pro-Trump debate, wearing his MAGA hat, after his SNL appearance.
It's not well received.
Kanye West was mocked in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a great performance where he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After performing his third song that night entitled Ghost Town in which he wore the hat Make America Great, he continued to oppose the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I ask white people a lot of times and they say, 'How can you support Trump, he's a racist?'
Look, if I'm worried about racism, I've been moving out of America for a long time", she said.
SNL began the show with a sketch starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star examined Brett Kavanaugh's confession before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it wasn't released, Kanye West's recording was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
I'm not sure Rock was trying to make fun of West with that post.
Also, West has complained to the audience that he has been having difficulty behind the scenes about his hat.
"They insulted me behind the scenes.
They said, 'Don't go out there with that hat.'
They're teasing me!
And then they say, "I'm in a place that doesn't matter", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West added, "Do you want to see that unimportant position?" by saying that he's gonna wear my Superman coat, because that means you can't lead me.
Try to love"
His comments drew ridicule at least twice from the audience and the SNL cast seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one there telling the broadcast: "The whole studio went silent".
West was brought in to replace singer Ariana Grande, where her ex-boyfriend, singer Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West surprised many with his performance of I Love It, dressed as a Perrier Bottle.
West received the support of the conservative TPUSA leader, Candace Turner, who sent a note: "To one of the bravest men: Thank you for your resistance to criticism".
But in the interview with host Karen Hunter, West said that he was just "being himself and that was great".
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their 'art') who I believe accepts and shares an ideology that harms my community.
He's free now.
We too", he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now known as "the guy who was formerly known as Kanye West".
He wasn't the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His friend, a rapper, Snoop Dogg once changed his name to Snoop Lion and of course the song refers to the legendary musician, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and later also as an artist formerly known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder in a robbery at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear in Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The star of Game of Thrones, Kit Harington, is poisoning the male sex.
Kit Harington is best known for his role as the sword hero Jon Snow in the HBO medieval fantasy series, Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has been breaking the stereotype of a maco hero, saying that his screen-playing character means young people often feel like they need to be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed 'something was wrong' and questioned how to address the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Games of Thrones' double star Rose Leslie, also 31, admits she feels 'very strong' about dealing with the problem.
'I think a little strong personally, at this point - where are we wrong with masculinity?' he said.
'What have we taught men as they grew up, in terms of the problems we see now?'
Kit believes television may be responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its highly masculine characters.
He added: 'What is nature and what is it taught?
What's taught on television, and on the streets, that makes boys feel they have to be guys like this?
I think that's one of the big questions right now - how do we change that?
Because there's clearly something wrong with young men today.'
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be cast in any prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying he was "finished with battlefields and horses".
In November, Kit will star in the remake of Sam Shepard's True West which is the story of a filmmaker and his brother, a bandit.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife, Rose, to be the best thing that ever happened to Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife on this show, so by doing so, it gave me a family future and my life started from here,' he said.
Rose portrayed Ygritte, the love of Jon Snow played by Kit, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been infected in the country, health officials said.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most new cases are sexually transmitted, signaling a change from the previous one.
Typically, HIV spreads rapidly through parts of China as a result of contaminated blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials told a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The spread of HIV through sex is a serious issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was no longer a crime in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be on the rise.
Because of the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Most of the spread of disease is due to insufficient sexual protection in relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies her staff leaked GOP senator data, defrauded of "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced the accusation of an employee of her having posted the personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on the legislature's Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat insists the claims were spread by members of the "ultra-right wing" and the website.
"Cheating, cheating and more serious cheating", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
This information reportedly included the address and phone number of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after three senators interviewed Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported IP addresses that identified the source of the mail associated with Waters' office and spread information to Waters staff, Hill said.
"These baseless accusations are false and a lie", Waters said again.
"My staff - whose identity, personal information, and security have been compromised by these false allegations - is completely unrelated to this information leak.
These baseless accusations are completely false and deceptive".
Waters' remarks quickly drew online criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is a rage", wrote Fleischer.
"This shows he has no qualifications as a Congressman.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they can't be angry.
They can't resist.
They can't question the motive of the accused.
They must feel calm".
Fleischer said while comparing Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics who appeared to be overly angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who ran to defeat Waters in the midterm elections, also voiced his opinion on Twitter.
"It's great news if it's true", he tweeted.
In fact, Waters said his office has informed "the relevant authorities and law enforcement entities about these false allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed", he said, "and they will be held accountable for all their actions that could be destructive and harmful to any and all of my staff".
Johnny English Strikes Again - a fraudulent fraud by Rowan Atkinson
It is common now to find signs of Brexit in any new film with British slang and it seems to apply to the revival of the Johnny English action-comedy-fraud franchise - which began in 2003 with Johnny Engilsh and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is it a satire of how badly we're becoming a new export opportunity for the country?
Anyway, Johnny English, who likes to stare and have a boring face, has the chance to ruin things for the second time - the sign name is more than anything that he is a widespread comic creation designed for the non-English speaking audience.
He was obviously a silly secret agent who had strange attributes to ease the glamour of having Clouseau, a little Mr Bean and a musician who contributed a note to the theme song to the Chariots of Fire at the London 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony.
He was also inspired by the mysterious international traveler and spy agent, Rowan Atkinson who once appeared in a now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercial, leaving chaos afterwards.
There's a great time or two in JE's latest movie.
I like Johnny English approaching the helicopter in a medieval suit and a fan blade attached to his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy was on the air, but his brand felt very weak and odd, especially "serious" films like 007 and Mission Impossible now confidently offering comedy as their material.
The comedy felt like it was being promoted to children rather than adults, and for me the accidental mistake Johnny English made was not innovating and focusing on Atkinson's films in the Bean persona.
The premise is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the secret web of the British web, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground and disappointing the agents on duty - a character that is very small for Kevin Eldon.
It was the last chance for a haughty prime minister struggling with political and unpopular collapse: Emma Thompson gave her best with this Teresa May sidekick but nothing good in the script for her character.
His intelligence advisor tells him every active intelligence officer has been compromised, and he needs to call someone out of retirement.
And that means Johnny English himself, who is a bully and now works as a schoolteacher in some luxury places, but gives a lesson that's not right for being a secret agent: some good jokes here, because English offers intelligence science at academies like School of Rock.
English was brought back to Whitehall for emergency briefings and reunited with his former assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, engaged to a submarine commander, a flamboyant character portrayed by Vicki Pepperdine who is rather unpleasant.
So, Batman and Robin, the brilliant undercover agents of His Majesty's Secret Service, are back in action against the beautiful tempting female character Ophelia Bulletova by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is being influenced by a charismatic tech millionaire who claims he can solve a British computer problem: the evil Jason Volta and played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their adventure with a small task: disguising themselves as waiters, lighting fires and burning French restaurants; struggling to sneak themselves into the luxurious Volta cruise ship; and English sparks chaos as he tries to use the headphones of the Maya Reality to get used to himself inside the Volta house.
All the funny scenes were well-played for the final round, but because it looked friendly and humorous there was a bit of a children's television show feel to it.
It's a rather simple film.
And like the other Johnny English films, I kept thinking: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a character that really suits his talent?
The Nafi Labour Party planned for the British people to work four days a week but pay for five days
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is considering a radical plan that would see Britons working four days a week - but paid for five days.
The party reportedly wants the bosses of the company to channel the savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to employees by giving them an extra day off.
It will see the staff enjoy a three-day weekend - but still bring home the same salary.
Sources said the idea was "in line" with the party's economic agenda and plans to bring the country to the workers' side.
Shifting to four-day work a week was supported by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of economic change.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: 'A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It won't happen overnight but working four days a week is an aspiration that fits the party's approach to balancing the economy and favoring workers and the party's overall industrial strategy.'
Labour was not the first to support the idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day work week in the 2017 election campaign.
However, this aspiration was not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'A four-day workweek is not the party policy and it is not considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to advance his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to seize power from the faceless director and the painter at the utility firm.
The shadow chancellor's plan also meant that current shareholders in the water company might not be able to recover their entire shares because the Labour government could make a 'cut' based on the grounds they were deemed to have committed a mistake.
He also confirmed plans to put employees on the company's board of directors and to create an Inclusive Ownership Fund to hand over 10 per cent of private sector firm equity to employees, who would receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told 60 Minutes whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination for at least a week, raising questions about whether the bureau's findings could influence Republican senators to give their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy seems more open than his South Carolina buddy.
"I mean, of course", Kennedy said.
"I told you to attend the trial, I said, I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, and the charges came up, and I said, 'Did you do that?'
He's firm, firm, clear".
Anyway, Graham's vote is already set.
"I've already made a decision against Brett Kavanaugh and it's going to take a heavy toll", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what's going on, but I know about this: Brett is constantly thinking about it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone he names can't verify it.
It's been 36 years.
Say doesn't see any change".
Is the World People's Day and has it done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the World Folk Festival, an annual music event that features an impressive lineup of great stars and their equally great mission; ending the world's poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the World People's Festival will see tens of thousands of people gather at the Great Place of Central Park not only to watch performances like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World People's Day, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the World Poverty Project, an international support group aimed at eradicating poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive free tickets to the event (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers will need to complete some task, or "act" such as volunteering, emailing world leaders, making phone calls or any other meaningful way to help raise awareness about their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how far will the people of the world go with 12 years to go to achieve their goals?
Is the idea of giving a free concert a sincere way to persuade people to demand an action, or just another case of clicktivism - to make someone feel they've done something by just signing an online petition or by sending a message?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says they have recorded 19 million actions from their supporters, who urged the movement with different goals.
They say these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion that will bring change to more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
By early 2018, the group had identified 390 commitments and announcements stemming from their actions, and at least $10 billion of that amount had already been paid or raised.
The group also estimates that these identified funds have affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key committees include the UK-based Nutrition Power, a partnership between investors and practitioners committed to helping children reach their full potential, pledging $35 million to Rwanda to help eliminate food imbalances in the country after receiving more than 4,700 grants from Gobal Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, federal governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make this unbalanced social inequality of food a thing of the past", said Food Authority Ambassador Tracey Ullman at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after receiving more than 5,000 calls for the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government has announced that it will fund a project, Food Power, which will now reach 5 million women and children in need.
Answering one of the most frequently asked questions on his website that asks, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen has responded: "This is a difficult and time-consuming path - we are sometimes disappointed and desperate.
But just like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before, we will succeed, because when we work together we will become stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the few artists who are also performing at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US can use the Navy as a barrier to prevent Russia from exporting oil - Home Secretary
Washington could use its Navy if necessary to prevent Russia from selling its oil to markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zinke said according to a Washington Examiner report.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria - as it is known, involving itself at the invitation of the Syrian government - was supposed to be to find new oil markets.
"I believe their presence in Central Timor is to dominate oil supplies as they have done in Eastern Europe and Southern Europe", he said.
And according to the official, there is a way to address this issue.
The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open, and if necessary, to block to ensure their oil cannot be marketed, he said.
Zinke said this during a speech at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that bills itself as the voice of oil consumers in the US.
He also compared Washington's actions against Russia and Iran, and emphasized the same actions.
The economic choice over Iran and Russia is more or less the same, affecting and replacing oil, he said, while referring to Russia as having no other choice and with its economy so dependent on oil.
The statement came as the Trump administration was on a mission to increase the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe that is much cheaper for consumers in Europe, replacing Russia.
As a result, Trump officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, have tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "near-facing" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump believes will make Berlin a Moscow-backed city.
Moscow has repeatedly said that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project will rely on the existing capacity of 110 billion cubic meters and it is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin denies that Washington's strong opposition to the project is for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we agree that energy supplies cannot be used as a weapon of oppression and consumers should be free to vote", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
This US action has sparked a wave of discontent in Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has called for the US to stay out of EU energy policy and also on the agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with a third country interfering in our country's energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrial Federation (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will be "Fast Thinking" to run for President in 2020, said a Massachusetts senator.
Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts Senator said on Saturday that she would "think about it" before running for president following the midterm elections.
When an open question and answer session with the residents of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren said he would consider running.
"It's time for a woman to head to Washington and fix our divided government and this includes putting a woman on top of it", he said according to The Hill report.
After November 6, I'll be thinking about running for president.
Warren expressed concern about President Donald Trump during an open question, saying that Trump was just driving our country in the wrong direction.
"I'm concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren was fiercely critical of Trump for nominating Brett Kavanaugh as a candidate for the Federal Court.
In a speech on Friday, Warren said that we'd definitely need an FBI investigation before the polls are held.
However, a poll on Thursday showed that the majority of residents in the area represented by Warren felt Warren was not worthy of running in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a survey by the Suffolk University/Boston Globe Center for Political Studies.
Thirty-two percent supported him running.
The poll also showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick to run, with 38 percent supporting his potential to run and 48 percent disagreeing.
Other high-profile Democrats who are also being discussed as potential to run in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin highlighted the disease Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Track Palin at the Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the Army in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my own son is going through, when I come home, I can feel the feelings of other families who are going through this PTSD and those who are coming home with injuries", she said at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said the events of his son's detention were "something remarkable" and he said of his son and other war veterans as, "They came home different, rather loud and wondering if they would be recognized for their sacrifices to the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence against a woman, disrupting domestic violence reports and possessing a gun while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennet, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, Washington is proud to support the new asylum policy.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support opposing a U.S. policy that prevents asylum for victims fleeing terrorist group or domestic violence attacks.
Representatives from 18 states and counties filed a friendship petition in court on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who opposes the policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Court of Appeals filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
He said his partner and his son's violent gang members had abducted him but U.S. officials rejected his asylum application on July 20.
He's in Texas.
Prosecutors from states that support Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which have the highest number of asylum seekers in the U.S., as countries filled with gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum application policy returns a decision made in 2014 in which the Immigration Appeals Board had allowed refugees fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, the District Attorney of Columbia, in a statement on Friday said the new policy "does not circumvent state, federal and international laws that have been in place for decades".
Federal law requires all applications for asylum to be decided based on the facts and circumstances leading to the application, and preventing it would violate those principles, according to the friend's statement to the court.
Prosecutors also dispute the policy that prevents immigrants from entering would worsen the U.S. economy, saying it is likely that these immigrants will become entrepreneurs and become the necessary workforce.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered an immigration judge to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence crimes and gang violence in June.
Asylum will be granted to those who leave their homeland for fear of persecution because of race, gender, nationality or because of membership in a particular social group or holding a different political stance, Sessions said when announcing the policy on June 11.
Asylum is not about solving all the problems -- even if all the problems are serious -- that everyone in this world faces every day.
Rescue work is increasing in Palu while the death toll is doubling.
For those who survived, the situation is getting more complicated.
"I feel very stressed", said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who is feeding her fever-ridden baby in the Palu displacement centre.
Every minute an ambulance brings a body.
The drinking water supply is very low.
Residents appear to be slowly heading back to their trapped homes, searching for their belongings in the water trying to save what they can.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
Among the injured, including Dwi Haris who suffered spinal and shoulder fractures, rested outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outside as the quake was still following.
Tears flow as he scans back as the earthquake shakes the fifth floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
There's nothing to save us.
I was stuck in a collapsed wall, I think", Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife's voice crying out for help, then I kept quiet.
I don't know what happened to my wife and my child.
I hope they're safe.
The US ambassador accused China of backing up propaganda
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a US newspaper detailing the US-China trade partnership, the US ambassador to China accused China of using American newspapers to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to a paid ad for the China Daily in the Des Moines Register - Iowa's best-selling newspaper - after accusing the country of trying to meddle in the November 6 congressional elections, an accusation China denied.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to meddle in the US election explains what US officials reported to Reuters as a new phase in the campaign to pressure China.
It has become common practice for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now engaged in a worsening trade war with each imposing tariffs on their imports.
China's initial move in this trade war was to target exporters in states like Iowa that supported the Republican Party represented by Trump, state experts in China and the US said.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and former Iowa governor, the largest exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing's move has troubled many American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, according to Branstad in a newsroom in the Des Moines Register on Sunday wrote, is now more offensive by posting propaganda ads in our own independent newspapers.
In broadcasting this propaganda, the Chinese government accepted the American-practiced freedom, a tradition that prioritizes freedom of speech and freedom of the press, Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the Beijing newspapers, there is very little opposition and you cannot see the real public view of the economic direction of the Chinese nation that is worrying because their media is tightly controlled by the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He also added that one of the leading newspapers in China avoided an offer to publish his article, although he did not specify which one.
Republicans are cutting back on women voters ahead of midterm elections because of Kavanaugh's story, warns analysts
While many prominent Republicans support and favor Federal Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh facing sexual harassment charges, analysts warn they will call for a response specifically from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
High emotion surrounded this story and most Republicans stated in their records that they would continue with the vote.
Those things cannot be changed", Grant Reeher, a political science professor at the Maxwell Center for Studies at Syracuse University, said in an article published Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher's uncertainty about Senator Jeff Flake's move to force the FBI to launch an investigation is enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will never forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow and also in November", Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive movement MoveOn, said Friday, according to the Washington D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters lit a fire on the floor of the Senate building as the Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee voted to continue with Kavanaugh's nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic ambition and motivation will explode", Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
People say this is too high; it's true.
This may be higher especially for women voters who will vote from suburban areas and young voters, 18-29 years old, who are disliked by the president and rarely vote.
Before Ford's public testimony detailing allegations of sexual assault against him by a federal court candidate, analysts speculated there would be pride if Republicans continued with confirmation.
"It's been a very complicated thing for the GOP", said Michael Steela, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just a committee vote or a final vote or if Kavanaugh wins the federal bench, it's about how Republicans handle the issue and how they treat him", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told a news conference.
However, Americans seem to be split in two and don't know who to trust in the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh with more than half in favor of Ford.
A recent YouGov survey showed 41 percent said they would or might believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they believe or might believe Kavanaugh.
Meanwhile, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh may or may not have lied in his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After being pressured by Flake, the FBI is now investigating Ford's allegations as well as at least one other allegation, reports Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian.
Last week Ford made an affidavit before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh accused him of being drunk when he was 17.
Ramirez also said the Federal Court nominee also showed his shame in front of Ford at a party while he was suing at Yale University in the 1980s.
The creators of the World Wide Web plan to launch a new Internet network to connect with Google and Facebook
The creator of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, launched a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is an open source company based on Berners-Lee's Solid software.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and who will be entitled to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's real goal was to dominate the world.
"We need to do this now", he said of the startup.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own personal online data storage or POD.
It may contain a contact list, a list of daily tasks, a calendar, a track list and other personal professional equipment.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify that's available in one browser and simultaneously.
What's unique about data storage in this personal store is that it's up to the user for whom to access the kind of information they need.
The company is screening it for personal control through data.
The key to this Inrupt, according to its CEO John Bruce, is to bring certain resources, processes and expertise to help people enjoy Solid.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, several developer staff contracted to work on the project and a community of volunteer code writers.
Starting this week, tech developers from around the world can create their own standalone apps without being centered anywhere using the hardware available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee also said he and his team had no discussions with Facebook and Google to introduce or not introduce a change in which all their business models would change instantly.
We're not asking for their permission.
In a Saturday issue of Medium, Bernes-Lee wrote, Inrupt, The mission is to provide a business and ecosystem energy to help protect the intergridity and quality of new websites built using Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the world of the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been arguing fiercely about the need for websites to be independent.
While launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain as the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the new era of the web", added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Priest of the First World War Victoria Cross recipients are commemorated
The only priest from the Church of England to receive the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a combat soldier was commemorated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Father Benard Vann who received this award on 29 September 1918 in the raids at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and unbeknownst to him he had ever known that he had been awarded the highest award of the British Army.
A memorial stone was erected and the curtain was opened by his two grandchildren in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was a glorious symbol because the stone would open the curtain exactly 100 years after his grandfather's brave act.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin which was filled with thick fog and surrounded by a massive machine-gun attack.
Then he flew to the border and with extraordinary bravery and leadership before he flew with his own rifle and shot three people.
The lieutenant colonel was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were something I couldn't possibly repeat and so touching.
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid a flowerpot after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Brigade.
Michael Vann said he was honoured to be part of this campaign and added to his true courage with the support of so many people.
MMA fans stay up all night watching Bellator 206, instead they're given Peppa Pig
Imagine, you're up all night watching Bellator 206 but disappointed in watching the main show.
A list from San Jose containing 13 matches, including six main matches that will be broadcast live every night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight, the UK audience was shocked when the broadcast switched to Peppa Pig.
Some of them are angry because they stayed up all night watching this game.
One fan said the switch to a children's cartoon channel was a funny joke through his lips.
"Government regulations show that broadcasts at 6 a.m. are not suitable for the game so they have to broadcast broadcasts for children", said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator when asked about the broadcast.
Khinzir's father, yes.
Bellator president Scott Coker said they were working to reschedule the broadcast so viewers in the UK could watch it.
"I think, when I talk about re-releases, I think we can do something", Coker said.
But at six o'clock on Sunday morning we could not do anything until Sunday in our time, which is their time on Monday.
We're working on it.
Trust me, when the broadcast is changed there's a lot of back-up and it's not all good to hear.
We're trying to solve this problem, we think it's a technical problem.
But no, it's more about government issues.
I promise you, this will never happen in the future.
We're going to limit it to five games instead of six -- as usual -- and we're trying to do something that's impossible to do for fans.
This is a miserable situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels humble about sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of humility due to his sexuality - but that's what motivated him to succeed.
She's 24 years old and she doesn't realize anything until she goes to high school and feels like everyone else is like me.
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, she spoke about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also talks about being a father after all, he doesn't care so much about winning the Olympics.
The regular host of this long-running show, Kris Young is on a few months vacation due to illness.
Her sudden appearance on Laverne's first show, Daley said she felt less than her peers as she grew up because she was not socially accepted as a man or woman.
He said: "To this day, feeling less than others and feeling different from others is what has driven me and given me the strength to succeed".
She wanted to prove that she was something she said, so she didn't let anyone down when they found out about her sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist is now a high-profile LBGT campaigner who has used her appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to make sure more countries no longer criminalize homosexuality.
He said he was talking like this because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without any problems and wanted to give hope to others like him.
The three-time world champion said the events of falling in love with a man - the American filmmaker, Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - were unexpected.
Daley married the Oscar winner who was 20 years older than her last year but she said their age gap was never an issue.
When you go through so much experience at such a young age -- she participated in her first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and her father died of cancer three years later -- she says it's very hard to find someone in this age group who's going through the same challenge.
The couple became the father in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that "all perspectives" of his life have now changed.
If you were to ask me last year, it was just about me winning the gold medal, he said.
There's actually more to it than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
Her son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said her father didn't want to accept the statement that she was going to die and one of the last things she asked was if their tickets to London 2012 had been bought - because she wanted to sit in the front seat once.
I can't say I'm not gonna be in the front line.
"I was still holding my father's hand when he stopped breathing and not until my father stopped breathing and was legally dead when I realized that my father would not live forever".
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I realize this is what I've dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of my fans in my own country at the Olympics, no other experience can match this", he said.
It also served as the inspiration for her first song selection - Proud by Heather Small - which she co-wrote with her during preparations for the Olympics and still makes her hairy Roma.
The Desert Island Disc will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson isn't so ready to face the Ryder Cup this Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a new record on Sunday when he plays for the 47th time in the Ryder Cup competition, but he must be prepared to redeem his performance so as not to end up disappointed.
Mickelson, who will play in this two-year event for a record 12 times, has been drafted by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's game fourballs and foursomes.
Despite being the usual focus for the United States, the winners of these five major tournaments spent time cheering and training in hopes of improving the quality of the game.
A man who can't hit the ball straight even when he's at the top of his game, the 48-year-old is not the right choice for Le Golf National, where his long distance is extremely difficult for a shot that doesn't hit the target.
And if this golf course is to make matters worse, Mickelson in Game 9 on Sunday will face British Open winner Francesco Molinari who has joined newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If an American player, four points behind, starts with 12 singles, starts with a strong one, then Mickelson's game is definitely a big one.
Furyk is so confident of his players, that's all he can say.
"He understood his role today, and he clapped his shoulders and put his hands on my shoulder and said he'd be ready by tomorrow", Furyk said.
He's very confident.
He's a very famous man and he's done a lot of good for this team all along, and this week.
I probably didn't imagine that he would play in two games.
I can imagine more than that, but that's the way and the way we thought we should do it.
He wants to be like everyone else.
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup appearances this Sunday.
This may be the last time he'll be in the Ryder Cup that never matches his personal best.
Mickelson won 18 games, lost 20 games and lost seven, although Furyk said his presence brought an injection of enthusiasm to his team.
"He's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, and it's fun to be in the team room", she said.
I think all the young players have had a lot of fun with him this week, and it's been fun to watch.
He's not just playing, but more than that.
Captain of the European team Thomas Bjorn knew their front position would slowly disappear
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knew from his experience that the distant front position he held could be lost on the final day of the Ryder Cup and complicate matters.
The Danishman first competed in the 1997 event at Valderrrama, where Seve Ballesteros drove as captain and led the American team by 5 points but was only able to win by a very thin margin once with a score of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself after a lead at Valderrama; we also got a lead at Brookline but we lost and at Valderram we won, but we won thin", Bjorn said after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to be ahead by 10-6 points at Le Golf National.
So history will prove to me and everyone on that team that this game is not over.
We'll fight our way through tomorrow.
Go out and play hard and don't make mistakes.
This isn't over as long as the eyes aren't picked up and spread on the backboard.
We have a goal of preserving this trophy, and we're going to focus on that goal.
I told you, I'm going to focus on the 12 players on our team, but we all have to realize who our opponents are - they're the greatest players in the world.
So happy with his men's accomplishments on such a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I can't possibly hold on.
Tomorrow is a new day.
Tomorrow, individual achievement has to be a drag and that's something different to do.
It's great to be out there with friends and when things are going well but when you're alone then your full potential as a golfer is tested.
This is the message that all players should hear, give your best tomorrow.
Now leave your friend and he must give the best in himself too.
Contrary to Bjorn's view, his opponent Jim Furyk would have expected his players to perform better as an individual player than a team event, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who managed to score three points out of four points.
Furyk himself had an experience on the last day where the position changed, being on the winning team at Brookline before a surprise defeat when the European team performed the Miracle at Medina.
"I remember every word he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, burned the spirit of the players on the final day.
We have 12 more shows tomorrow, but if you all want to get started as fast as you see in Brookline, as you see in Medina.
When momentum starts, it'll put pressure on the event in the middle.
We're gonna line up our players in a way we think is right, we're gonna try to do something great tomorrow.
Thomas was tasked with fighting back and clashing with Rory McIlroy in the main event, alongside Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter European players who were in the top spot of the first division.
"I made this rule because I think it's going to be consistent and inclusive", Bjorn said of the individual player's choices.
The new German warship is delayed again.
The German Navy should have received its newest frigate in 2014 to replace the Cold War-era warship, but the ship will not be completed until next year due to system damage and rising costs, according to local media reports.
The inspection of the battleship Rhineland-Pfalz, the first ship under the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate brand has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper quoting a military spokesman.
The warship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but unfortunately, the post-conmission problem hampered the fate of this large project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates commissioned by the Navy in 2007 will replace the Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that it will contain features such as high-powered cannon, various anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft equipment as well as some obscuring features such as reduced radar detection, red lights and acoustic capabilities.
Another important feature was a longer maintenance life span - the new frigate must be capable of sailing for up to two years from its keel.
However, the various obstacles meant that this advanced warship which was said to be capable of highlighting German power overseas - would be outdated by the time the ship entered naval service, according to Die Zeit
This unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year, when German naval officials refused to authenticate the warship and returned it to Hamburg shipbuilding firm Blohm & Voss.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to its builder after delivery.
Not much is known about the reasons for the ship's return, but German newspapers mention some damage to the software and equipment that rendered the warship useless if sent on a combat mission.
The damage to the software had to be taken seriously as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class battleships would be operated by only 120 squadrons - half of what was needed to operate the old Bremen-class frigates.
It also highlights the fact that the battleship is too heavy and this will reduce performance and limit the ability of the Navy to make any future improvements.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz warship is believed to be twice as heavy as the warship of the same class that was used by the German army during World War II.
In addition to damage to the device, the overall cost of the project - including training for the class - was also an issue.
The project is said to have reached €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - up from its original price of €2.2 billion.
The problems with this latest frigate show the lack of German naval capability.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the parliamentary defence committee, admitted that the Navy was facing a shortage of capable warships that could move.
The official also said the issue was worsening, as old warships that had been discontinued were not getting replacement warships.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust is feeding the bat life
A recent study being conducted on an estate in the Scottish Highlands aims to explain why bats use the shape of the earth to hunt for food.
It is hoped that this study will lead to the latest findings on the unique mammalian behaviour of these flying animals and could serve as a guide to conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common bat, and the soprano bat pipistrelles as well as the long-eared brown bat and the Daubenton bat at Inverewe Park in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at certain locations around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using mobile tracking tools.
An expert analyzing the sound of all the recordings will identify the frequency of each species and species and the actions of these bats.
A habitat map and report will be produced to create a large-scale picture of the Earth's surface shapes of the bat's behavior.
Rob Dewar, conservation advisor to NTS, hopes the results of this study will show the most important habitat areas for bats and how they are used by each species of bats.
This information will help identify habitat management benefits such as making grasslands and the best ways to manage forests for bats and other related species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the UK has declined significantly over the past century.
The bats are threatened by construction and development work that disrupts the habitat of the bats and loses habitat.
Wind turbines and lights are also a risk to bats like fly trap paper and some chemicals used to treat building materials as well as pet cat attacks.
Actually, bats are not blind.
Because bats hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They used sound-based location tracking techniques to identify insect positions and obstacles while in flight.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is of great importance to bats.
They had ten trained specialists who often conducted surveys, checked the landing sites and sometimes rescued bats.
The organisation has also established the first bat sanctuary in Scotland at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is where eight out of ten species of bats in Scotland live.
Estate manager David Thompson says this estate is the best place for bats.
"At Thereave we have a very suitable place for bats", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of big trees and suitable habitat.
There's a lot more we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand what bats need to survive and thrive.
He stressed the importance of conducting inspections before starting maintenance work on the property because there is a possibility that we might accidentally destroy a bat nest that would contain bats where this would kill 400 female bats and bats, and possibly destroy the entire local bat population.
Bats are protected and it is a crime to kill, torture or disturb or destroy a nesting place of bats.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an official for the Bat Conservation Trust encourages the public to help.
He said: "There's still a lot to learn about bats and for many species we don't know how their populations grow.
Ronaldo denies the rape charges while his lawyer prepares to cover a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo said the allegations of rape against him were fake news and said that some people were trying to promote themselves by using his name.
His lawyer will be suing the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges against him.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward was accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He was later said to have paid $375,000 to shut the victim's mouth according to a Der Spiegel report on Friday.
Speaking in an Instagram Live video to his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo denounced the report as "fake news".
That's not true.
What they said today was fake news, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
They want to promote themselves by using my name.
Just be yourself.
They want to be famous by calling my name, this is part of my job.
I'm a happy person and everything is fine, said the player with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue De Spiegel over the allegations, which they called "an unfounded and disturbing report on privacy", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for "moral damage that directly interferes with his personality, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years".
The incident was reported to have occurred in June 2009 in a luxury room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga were reportedly returning to the player's hotel room, where he was accused of passing the woman without permission, according to an investigation paper registered at Clark County Courthouse in Nevada.
Most claimed after the incident that the player knelt in front of him and said he was 99 percent was a good man and only got knocked out because one percent.
The document confirms Ronaldo admitted to having sex, but on the basis of similar likes.
Majorga also alleged that he filed a police report and photographed injuries he sustained while in hospital, but later agreed to settle it out of court because he was "scared of the reaction" and worried about "pollution by the public".
The 34-year-old woman now wants to cancel the previous settlement because she's still traumatized by what happened.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester when the allegations came to light, and this summer he had moved to Italian football giant Juve for €100 million.
Brexit: UK will forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
The UK will regret forever losing its status as the world leader in car production after Brexit, said Secretary of Commerce Greg Clark.
He added this was rather troubling because Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the European Union without a solution, it would stop production of its car factory in Burnsaston, near Derby, for a while.
We need a solution, Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of this would lead to border shipping problems if no solution to Brexit is found and this would lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant - which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis cars - installed nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
"I think if Britain leaves the European Union without a solution by the end of March, we will stop production of cars in our factories", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Several other UK automakers including Honda, BMW as well as Jaguar and Land Rover have also expressed concern if the UK leaves the European Union without a solution on how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW said they would close their Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The carmakers' main concern is the risks to the supply chain if there is a no-solution Brexit.
Toyota's car production relies on an installation basis based on timely delivery without the need to be stored with car parts being brought into the factory every 37 minutes from all UK and EU lines for the car ordered.
If the UK leaves the European Union without any settlement on 29 March, there is a high probability of border disruption that industry players predict will result in delays and shortages of spare parts.
Toyota is unlikely to be able to store inventory supplies for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production will be halted.
Mr Clark said the future plans of Finance Minister Theresa May for bilateral relations with the European Union "must be made with a view to avoiding any border checks".
"We need a solution. We want a solution that will not only enable us to succeed for now but to take advantage of this opportunity", he told the BBC on Radio 4's Today programme.
The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers suggests that we must continue this very successful supply chain.
Toyota cannot say how long its production will be stopped, but in the long run warns of rising costs and reducing the competitiveness of this plant and subsequent job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the union member responsible for union management at the factory, said the union members were starting to worry: "In my experience, lost jobs will never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a concrete and robust plan for the future relationship between us and the European Union.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, the White House says.
The most important meeting between Donald Trump and deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein may be postponed to next week as the debate over Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the federal bench continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein is overseeing the special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference, ties between Trump aides and Russia and the possibility of obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump fires the deputy attorney general or not and then interferes with Mueller's freedom to pursue the investigation has been the hottest rumor in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was planning to use a secret recorder to record his conversations with Trump and the possibility of replacing the president with the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday, he stepped into the White House, despite reports that he was resigning.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump who was then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he was reluctant to fire Rosenstein but the meeting was postponed to avoid him clashing with the confession of Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blassey Ford one of the women who accused Kavanaugh of molesting him, before the Senate Judiciary Committee, who both confessed.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which has delayed the full Senate vote.
Trump press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date has not yet been set, maybe this week, I think it might be postponed another week given some things going on in federal court.
We'll see later and I'll keep the press updated.
Some reporters will dispute it: Sanders hasn't held a White House press conference since September 10.
When the host asked why.
Sanders said he didn't hold many press conferences not because he didn't like TV reporters trying to get attention but he also said: "I disagree because they really want attention".
Then he said the relationship between the press and Trump would grow.
The president has held the most questionnaires of any president before him, he said without providing any evidence.
The press conference will continue, Sanders said, but if the press has the opportunity to ask something directly to the president of the United States, it's better than talking to me.
We're trying to do this more often, and you've seen we've done a lot of that over the last few weeks and this will replace the press conference when you can talk directly to the president of the United States.
Trump often answers questions from the press while on his way out of the White House or while attending an open question and answer session or during a press conference with his guests of honor.
Single media meetings are rare.
This week in New York, the president shows why he sometimes makes freely and oddly appearances in front of a gathering of reporters.
The health secretary wrote to EU employees at the NHS about their concerns about Brexit
The Secretary of Health has written a letter to all EU employees working at NHS Scotland to express their gratitude to the country and hope they will continue to work here after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a decree less than six months before the UK left the European Union.
The Scottish Government has also committed to bear the costs of applying for permanent residence for EU citizens working in its public sector.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union on the withdrawal have been ongoing, and are on track to reach a decision by autumn.
But the UK government has stepped up its preparations to face an unsolved scenario.
I know this is something that is very troubling to all of you.
That's why I want to emphasize how much I appreciate the contributions of each of you, regardless of your nationality.
We work with partners from across the European Union and other countries, bringing together a wealth of experience and expertise that strengthens and improves healthcare and benefits patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you all to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers defensive end Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury after a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ of the Tennessean.
Head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before the second half.
"He was near the edge and suddenly fell there", Reed said.
The coach and health officials gave Abercrombie oxygen there before putting him in a foster home and taking him for further treatment.
An officer from Tennessee State told Chirs Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had completed surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there was no information on the type/ extent of the injury at this time and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a first-year redshirt freshman, played his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He's already done five cooking on Saturday before he's out of the game, his total for the season is 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK and this surplus will be used to help the displaced under the Tory's latest scheme.
This move would undermine Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
This stamp duty will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury is expected to raise up to £120 million a year - to help the displaced
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK - the money from this will be used to help the displaced, Theresa May said today.
This move seems to be a slap in the face of Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with the promise of affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
This stamp duty increase will be imposed on individuals and firms that do not pay taxes in the UK, and the money from this proceeds will help the government address the problem of homeless people.
This addition - is an addition to the stamp duty already imposed including the higher duty introduced two years ago on second homes and rented homes that may be charged three percent.
The Treasury is expected to raise up to £120 million a year through this move.
An estimated 13 percent of new properties in London are bought by non-UK residents, causing prices to skyrocket and making it difficult for those looking to buy their first home.
Most luxury areas - especially in the capital - have become quiet because many of its owners are foreign owners who spend a lot of time abroad.
The new policy was announced just weeks after Boris Johson demanded a reduction in stamp duty so more young people could afford their first home.
He accused the big construction companies of deliberately keeping the property prices high by buying land but not developing it, and persuaded Mrs May to remove quotas on affordable ownership to overcome Britain's shameful housing problem.
Mr Corbyn has announced a number of interesting housing reform proposals, including rental controls and the abolition of evictions.
He also wants more power given to council members to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my term as prime minister to restoring the British dream - this life must be better for every generation to come.
And that means fixing our poor housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is unfair because it is so easy for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as companies with a background abroad to buy a home compared to the British people who work hard here.
For too many people, the dream of owning their own home is far too far away, and the reality of living around in shame is real.
Jack Ross: My main goal is to manage Scotland
Sunderland boss Jack Rosa said his main goal was to manage Scotland one day.
The 42-year-old Scot was looking forward to a challenging opportunity to re-establish the third-placed North-East side in League One, three points below the top spot.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after bringing St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
I want to represent the country as a player.
I got a call for the B cap and that's it", Ross told BBC Scotland Sportsound.
I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad as a child, and there was always something that attracted me there.
That chance will only come if I succeed as manager at the club level.
Ross's successors as manager of Sunderland included Dick Advocaat, Dovid Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin ONeil, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former manager Alloa Athetic said he was not feeling comfortable following the footsteps of such famous names in major clubs, as he had previously rejected applications from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
For me, the key to success at this point is, can I bring this club back to the Premier League?
Because of the structure and facilities of the club, it deserves to be in the Premier League, he said.
It's not easy to achieve, but I'd consider myself a success if I could get this club back into the Premier League.
Ross is just three years into management, having been assistant manager at Dumbarton and one of the coaches at Hearts for 15 months.
He then helped Alloa back to the third tier after relegation and changed the fate of St Mirren from relegation to becoming Champions the following season.
And Ross said he's more comfortable now than when he was a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
It was an option, he recalled, when he was handling Alloa.
I know that the management field is more like me than the play.
It sounds weird because I've been successful, able to live happily ever after and enjoy some exciting moments.
That's a little hard to play.
There's a lot you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of the pressure and the pressure of working as a player but as a manager I'm more comfortable.
I always wanted to take care of it, and now I'm doing it, and I feel comfortable doing something I love my whole adult life.

The best time to drink beer is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, according to a study.
This summer's heat wave brought good luck to Britain's troubled pubs but networked restaurants were under pressure.
Pubs and bars showed sales up 2.7 percent in July -- but in restaurants it fell 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin from the business consulting firm CGA who compiled these figures said: "Continuous hot weather and England's longer World Cup campaign means July will follow the pattern of June, where pubs rose 2.8 percent, unless restaurants decline even more.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant business in June worsened in July.
The performance of pubs that prioritize drinks and bars is much stronger than that of restaurants that are in decline.
Pubs that focused on food also suffered bad luck from the hot weather, but not as bad as restaurant operators.
Looks like most people just want to go out for a beer.
Pubs and bars recorded sales growth of 6.6 percent for the month, while food fell 3 percent.
Paul Newman, an entertainment and food analyst at NGO said: "The decision seems to be the same and has been going on since the end of April.
Weather and social events or sporting events are still major factors in increasing sales in the outdoor market.
Not surprisingly, the restaurant group continues to shrink, sales falling 4.8 percent compared to last year, which is probably worse with the cost pressures.
The long summer heat of summer has been a terrible time for restaurant operators and only time will tell if colder weather like the one we experienced in August will bring relief.
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new ones, was 2.7 percent in July, indicating a dampening in the newly introduced brands.
Observers for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sales sector The Coffer Peach Tracker collected and analyzed performance data from 47 groups operating with turnover of £9 billion is an industry benchmark.

Eilidh Doyle was appointed to the board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the governing body's general meeting.
Doyle is a well-known Scottish racing athlete and chairman Ian Beattie explained this move was an opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from Doyle's extensive international experience of over a decade.
ilidh is highly respected in Scotland, the UK and the international athletic community and we are sure that the athletes in Scotland will benefit greatly from his participation in this board", said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I want to be a voice for all athletes and I hope to contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland.

The advertisement for breast milk pumps that made comparisons to cows brought conflicting opinions online
A breast milk pump company received mixed reviews online because of their advertisements comparing breastfeeding mothers to cows being milked.
To launch what they say is the world's first wearable, silent breast milk pump, consumer technology company Elvie released a humorous music video to show the freedom that mothers can feel when using this new pump.
Four mothers dancing in a haystack to a song whose lyrics are: "Yes, I'm a milk pump myself, but you can't see any tail and if you don't realize this is not a whitish, this is my breast.
The coronary artery: pump out, pump out, I'm breastfeeding, pump out, pump out, I'm pumping my breasts.
However, this ad posted on the firm's Facebook page has sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views, and hundreds of comments, this video has attracted a wide range of reactions from the public, many of whom say it gives a cheerful picture of the dairy industry that is "crashing".
An unreasonable decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, cows must be shaved and have to give birth to produce milk, but unfortunately, calves are divorced from their mother within a few days of their birth, says one writer.
Elvie milk powder can be completely inserted into the breastfeeding colic secretly.
Another commented: "Semynys is a trauma for the bull and the calf.
But what word do you use to advertise milk pumps for mothers who can keep their babies?
Another added: "An advertisement that should not be directly relevant".
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she found the song "very heartwarming".
"I think this is a genius idea.
I'd buy one if I still fed the body.
Packing makes me feel like a cow.
The ad was a little crazy, but I think it's what it was.
This is a genius product", one wrote.
Another commented: "This is a funny ad aimed at mothers who are spitting (often at work or in the bathroom) and feel like 'fat.'
This is not a commercial that praises or evaluates the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they've all been dancing with pumpkins hidden in their underwear.
The concept behind this campaign is based on the assumption that most women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
However, Pam Elvie is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and can be hidden in a shirt in the milk, giving women freedom to move, hold their babies, and even get out while packing.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: "Pam Elvie is such a revolutionary product, it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By likening a woman who is breastfeeding to a breastfeeding cow, we want to put the body's milk cream and all the challenges associated with it as the main focus, while showing a way to connect and connect with the feeling of freedom through the use of new pumps.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the stage for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Move With Their Snakes to Camp Camps on the Texas Border
The number of migrants detained is increasing despite the monthly border movements not changing much, due to the rhetoric and heavy policies introduced by the Trump administration, making placement of children with security even more difficult.
Traditionally, the guarantors were undocumented immigrants, and they feared that their status would be compromised if they took a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that future guarantors and other adult family members would have to hand over their fingerprints, and the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, the senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, testified before Congress that the agency had detained dozens of individuals who had applied to be guarantors for unprotected children.
The agency confirmed that 70 percent of those detained had no prior criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of individuals, whether insured or family members of insured, are here illegally and most of them are unauthorized immigrants.
And so we're going to keep hunting those individuals", Albence said.
To process children more quickly, authorities introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of their detention, not after 60 days according to previous standards, according to protection workers.
Many will be present via video conference call, rather than present in person, to plead their case for a legal standing before an immigration judge.
Those deemed unfit for assistance will be deported immediately.
The longer these children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or nervous, and this will lead to a sting or an attempt to escape, according to security officials and according to reports released by the system in recent months.
Supporters say that the concern is higher in larger facilities like Tornillo, where signs that children are struggling with feelings may not be detected, due to the size of the venue.
They added that by moving children to the camp town without providing them with time to prepare emotionally, or saying goodbye to friends, it may worsen the trauma they are experiencing.
Syria is heading for the US, French and Turkish troops to retreat immediately
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem urged Syrian refugees to return, even though the war in the country has reached its eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the post of deputy prime minister, said foreign troops on Syrian soil under the guise of fighting terrorism "will be dealt with appropriately".
"They should withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the conference.
Moualem stressed that "the war on terrorism is over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions more have been displaced.
He said Damascus will continue "to fight this holy war until we eliminate Syria" from both violent groups and any foreign occupation.
The United States has 2,000 troops in Syria, specifically for training and advising the Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the battlefield.
Regarding the refugee problem, Moualem said the conditions were favorable for them to return, and he accused "some foreign countries" of "spreading irrational fear" that caused the refugees not to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help with this return", he said.
"They're politicizing what should be purely a humanitarian issue".
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be given reconstruction aid until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The UN diplomat said the agreement between Russia and Turkey to provide a military-free zone in rebel-held Idlib area has created an opportunity for further political talks.
The Russian-Turkish talks have diverted a major attack by the Russian-backed Syrian army on the territory where three million people live.
Moualem however insisted that the agreement had a clear time limit and expected military action to target jihadists including Nusra Front rebels linked to Al Qaeda, who "will be eliminated".
The UN special envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to arrange the first meeting of the new committee, which will include the government and opposition members to draft the post-war balance sheet and pave the way for elections.
Moualem stated the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "browsing the current constitutional articles", and warned of disruption.
Because Trump's gonna win the second round.
With that logic, Trump would win re-election in 2020, unless, as liberal observers expected, impeachment charges and scandals ended his presidency prematurely.
In a situation that is undeniably the "most dramatic finale of a presidential career!"
At this time, there are no signs of lethargy.
Since 2014, prime time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average premiere viewership of 2.4 million, up from 1.7 million, four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has topped the cable ratings, reaching 3.5 million viewers on premiere news nights.
"This is a fire that attracts people because it's not something we understand", said Neal Baer, lead producer of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor", a story about a cabinet secretary who became president after the Capitol was destroyed.
Nell Scovell, veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club", had another theory.
He remembers a taxi ride before the 2016 election.
The driver told her she was going to vote for Trump.
Why? he asked.
"He said, 'Because he made me laugh,'" Mrs. Scovell told me.
There's a value in fun in a mess.
True, unlike what's on TV, a story that originated in Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite or global economic health.
Not following developments is just fun for the lucky audience.
However, it's a far cry from being an informed citizen when you find yourself watching a panel of experts arguing about the use of "deep background" by Bob Woodward in search of sources for his book "Fear, a $15,000-dollar camel-skin bomber jacket by Paul Manafort ("a thick cloth with a magnificent head", says The Washington Post) and a sensational commentary by Stormy Daniels on Trump's ah, anatomy.
I'm not going to see Super Mario with the same view again.
"Some of what he does is like in reality shows that look like he's feeding you something every night", said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and "Pawn Stars", about Trump's story with the daily cast and plot swap (starting a fight with the N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss an episode or you'll miss it.
When I visited Fleiss this week, the weather outside his house in northern Kauai was 80 degrees, but he was stuck in the house watching MSNBC while filming CNN.
He can't leave TV, not when Brett Kavanaugh is appointed to the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court is still uncertain.
"I remember when we were doing a crazy show before and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke but the reality is they were kidding".

Foreign money flooded into fierce competition the midterm elections chamber
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th election showed a flood of money, given the reunification of congressional districts showed two councillors now running for the same seat.
The redesigned Pittsburg subdistrict contested Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb - who won his seat in a special election the previous spring.
Lamb competed against another current trustee, Republican Rep. Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of old Pennyslvania, which is contested by the new 17th.
The map was repainted when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old district had been drawn across the Republican border.
The new 17th in-game has kicked off a fierce financial campaign rivalry between the main party financial machinery Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a March special election for the popularly-attended 18th Congressional District of Pennyslvania.
The seat has been won by Republicans for a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
A group of politically intelligent people have given the Democrats an edge.
The U.S. was planning to fine El Salvador for supporting China, then backed down.
Diplomats from the Dominican Republic and Panama have recognized Beijing, with little negative response from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela, Panama in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization management team.
Government Department officials decided to recall the US diplomatic chiefs from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the latest decision not to recognize Taiwan", Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But the fine was only imposed on El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control and economic support.
The proposed fines, including cuts to financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have a negative impact on the Central American country with high rates of abuse and murder.
After an internal meeting was held, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, following a similar meeting last year that appeared to be a positive step in preventing immigrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials decided that they wanted the conference to continue, effectively stopping any consideration of fining El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence will now address the conference, scheduled for mid-October, as a signal of the administration's import of places in the meeting, according to diplomats.
And all three American delegates quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any message or a definite fine from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who had agreed to discuss internal considerations on condition of anonymity.
Their statements are backed by outside analysts close to the administration and also speak on a conditional basis.
The study of history
What's next is perhaps the special counsel Robert Mueller's report on the possibility of a legal challenge by Trump, which is now well documented in the public record.
Mueller will also suspend an investigation to investigate whether Trump's campaign has joined Russia in the attack on our election.
If Congress turns its hands, Trump will face responsibility on the side, as soon as he's ready to face the voters, and maybe eventually a jury that includes his peers.
This is all if, and I'm not saying that Trump's downfall is certain - or people like him in Europe.
There are choices that we all have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long this struggle will last.
In 1938, German officials were prepared to attempt a coup against Hitler, if the West did not follow Hitler and support the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We've failed, and we've missed the opportunity to avoid the brutal killings that occurred in the years to come.
The historical journey revolves around such an inflection point, and the unbridled journey of democracy will be accelerated or delayed.
The American people are facing some of these inflationary points right now.
What are we gonna do if Trump fires Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the determination of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since the newspaper reported that, last year, he had proposed to make a presidential record and made speculation that the president was not eligible for the position.
Rosenstein said the Times's account was inaccurate.
"What would we do if the new FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh was incomplete or unfair - or if he was confirmed to the Supreme Court despite clear sexual assault charges and evidence of fraud?
And more, will we vote for a congressional term limitation on which Trump will be held accountable?
If we fail those tests, democracy will go through a long winter.
But I believe we will not fail, given the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was of Czechoslovak Jewish descent who had been deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had occupied my embassy.
He survived, moved to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light a Sabbath candle on a table with a swastika.
With that as my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic about the battle with Rapid Vienna
Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win against Austria, following a series with Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, would put them in a strong position to qualify them in Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his debut this season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believed the Rangers used this result as a stepping stone to a great win.
"It's a good point because Villarreal are a good team", the 31-year-old said.
"We played this tournament with the belief that we would get something and we had got one point.
We might win at the end of the game, but the series might be a fairer outcome.
They probably played better in the first half and we played better in the second half and in the better side.
On Thursday, another great night in Europe.
We were hoping we got three points but the competition was tough because they got good results in the previous games but, the audience supported us, I'm sure we'll play well and get a positive result.
Last year was really hard, in the midst of all the things that happened with my injury, and the internship at the club but there's a fun factor about this place right now.
The squad is good and the team feels good; the training is good.
We hope we can make the best of it, leave last season and make it".
Women can't sleep because of this pension savings concern.
While the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, some had even talked to their family members about it.
Half of the individuals in the Nationwide Study stated that they had discussed with their spouse the cost of long-term maintenance.
Only 10 percent talk to their children about it.
"They want family members to take care of them but they don't take steps to talk", says Holly Snyder, vice president of the National Insurance Business.
Here's how to start.
Talk to your spouse and child: You will not be able to provide a family to provide care for you if you do not tell them in advance.
Working with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to get care, because that choice will be a key factor in determining the cost.
Bring your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Funding for long-term care can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash value life insurance policy to help protect these expenses or self-insurance with your wealth - as long as you have money.
Finish your legal documents: Finish your legal war at once.
Put a healthcare representative in place so you can appoint someone you trust to supervise your healthcare and ensure that the professionals are at your discretion if you can't communicate.
Consider also the proxy for your finances.
You'll choose someone you trust to make decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid if you can't afford them.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine your grandmother has a medical emergency and is on her way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Describe these details in a written plan so that you are prepared.
"It's not just the finances that are set, but who's the doctor?" asked Martin.

Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities, the death toll is expected to rise.
With the lack of a communication system, authorities were unable to obtain information from Donggala government, northern Palu region near the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Here are the main facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of 379,800 as of 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is a 300 km (180 mi) coastal administrative region on the northwest coast of Sulawesi Island.
The administrative region, an administrative region under the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and farming are the backbone of the economy of Central Sulawesi, especially in Donggala waters.
Nickel mining is also important in the region, but is concentrated only in Morowali, on the coast opposite Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by Tsumani several times in 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, the tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is seismically located in the Pacific Ring of Fire and is constantly hit by earthquakes.
Here are the great earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake in the western coast of Acheh province, Indonesia in northern Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the waters of the Indian Ocean, half of those in Aceh.
2005: A series of earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of victims on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hits southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hits the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Kota Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake hits one of the Mentawai Islands, in Sumatra, triggering a tsunami up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed 300 people.
2016: A moderate earthquake hits Pidie Jaya's government area of Acheh, causing devastation and panic, reminding residents of the devastating events of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was triggered at the time, but over 100 casualties were caused by the collapse of buildings.
2018: A powerful earthquake hits the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded at the time.
Sarah Palin's eldest daughter is being held on domestic violence charges.
Track Palin, the eldest daughter of former Alaska Governor and presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic assault, disruption of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to police reports, while a friend of the woman tried to make a police call to report the allegations of the crime, he had taken the phone from the woman.
Palin was remanded in custody at Mat-Su's pre-trial facility and held with an unsecured bond of $500, KTUU reported.
He was brought before the court on Saturday, where he had pleaded "definitely, innocent" when asked about the confession, the network reported.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He's also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, the teen was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the allegations of the attack.
This case is being heard in the Alaska Military Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, disrupting domestic violence crime reports and possession of a weapon in intoxication in connection with the incident.
Palin's girlfriend's friend claims the man punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a group of veterans in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior to PTSD following her service in Iraq.
Indonesian earthquake tsunami: hundreds of victims
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks were also affected with deaths expected to rise in the next few days.
An earthquake struck outside Central Sulawesi located northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulated on social media show the time of the incident.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach to celebrate in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the beach.
Prosecutors are seeking an extraordinary death sentence for the suspect in the NYC terrorist attack.
New York prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people -- an extraordinary sentence that has not been carried out in the state calling for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was charged with using a rented Home Depot truck to carry out an assault on a bike path along the West Side of Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists in his lane on Oct.
To pass the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intended" to kill the eight victims and "intended" to inflict serious bodily harm, according to a notice with the intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges lead to the death penalty, according to court documents.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 charges including eight counts of murder for illegal activity, which is always used by prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of terrorism and motor vehicle destruction.
The attack required "a thorough planning and planning", according to prosecutors, describing how Saipov carried out the act as "criminal, cruel and degrading".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, pain, and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", according to a notice with intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a long time since the Southern District of New York has filed a death penalty lawsuit.
Defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time capital punishment was imposed for a New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been sentenced to death after being convicted of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenberg were sentenced to death in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, was found not guilty on the day and month after the attack according to court documents.
He made a statement to the investigators that he was happy with what he was doing, according to police.
Saipov said he was prompted to carry out the attack after watching ISIS video on the phone, according to the allegations.
He also asked for the ISIS flag to be displayed in hospital rooms, according to police.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal martial lawyers representing Saipov, said they were "extremely disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
"We felt the decision to seek a death sentence versus accepting a guilty plea to life in prison without the possibility of parole, only prolonging the trauma of this incident for all involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense earlier asked that the prosecution not seek the death penalty.
According to the Tory MP, NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for running the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to 'mobilize the people's army' today during a protest at the Tory convention.
The former head of Ukip said politicians should 'feel the stuff' of Eurosceptics - as one of the MPs, Theresa May, recommended she should be given the responsibility of running the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told a rally in Birmingham that the UK would "get out now" if Farage became Brexit secretary.
But the challenge for May was to resolve the split between supporters of the Remain Tories who joined the city's Brexit protests.
The prime minister is working to ensure that the Chequers' ambitious plan remains in place amid attacks from Brexiteer, Remain and the EU.
The allies insisted May was holding talks with Brussels despite the impact faced - and Eurosceptic and Labour's power to choose between her package or 'mess-up'.
Bone told the out-of-town meeting that out of Solihull was to be 'waste Chequers'.
He recommended that Farage be made a nobleman and given the responsibility of negotiating with Brussels.
'If he was given that responsibility, we'd be out now,' he said.
Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: 'I support Brexit but we must get rid of Chequers.'
He protested against the EU, saying: 'We are not fighting a world war to be slaves.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.'
Bone rejected the suggestion that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain is not correct at all.'
Brexit Tory supporter Andrea Jenkyns, who also attended the march, told reporters: 'I just said: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'Chequers are not popular with the public, the opposition will not vote in favour, they are not popular in our party and the activists on the streets who voted for us.
Please drop the Chequers and start listening.'
In a message to May, he added: 'The prime minister will continue to hold office if they keep their promise.'
Farage said politicians should "feel the need" if they want to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
'Now this is a trust between us - the people - and the political class,' he said.
'They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here to tell them 'we're not going to let them get away with doing that.'
In a message to an enthusiastic audience he added: 'I want you to make our political class, which almost betrayed Brexit, feel the sting.
We are preparing to prepare the people's army that gave us victory in Bexit and will not rest until we make the United Kingdom independent, have its own government, proud.'
Meanwhile, the Remainer marched through Birmingham before holding a rally in the city centre.
Activists even spread Tories banners against Brexit after the group's launch over the weekend.
Labour peer Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the security problems they faced with the party's app when the conference began.
'They say they can put IT systems in place and all the technology with Canada and so on, for borderless interference, for borderless trade,' he added.
'It's all a play.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,' he added.
Warren is proposing to "examine" to run for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "examine running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that a Massachusetts Democrat presented his plans for the future during a town hall in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a staunch critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November with GOP state Rep. Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
He's been speculated to run for President Trump in 2020.
Saturday's midday event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters using the town hall format since Trump took office.
One of the contestants asked if he wanted to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington to fix a broken government, and this included a woman on the top of the stairs".
The arrest was made in the shooting death of Sims from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET news conference.
They've been leaking video of Friday's shooting, asking for help identifying the man seen on the tape.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and ultimately died as a result", Chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday, via 247sports.
Wayde acted in defense of his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, to having a gun and admitting to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed under custody of the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaching the World Championship gap when the team ordered him to win, defeating Sebastian Vettel
It was obvious at the time, Valtteri Bottas qualifying ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, "the direction of the Mercedes team played a key role in this race.
From a poor start, Bottas got off to a good start, nearly beating Hamilton while defending his position in the first two rounds and inviting Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel got into the pit first and left Hamilton in traffic at the end of the group, which was supposed to be final.
Mercedes then entered the pit on the next lap and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton then made a tire-to-tire move that made the Ferrari driver leave the interior free at risk to defend himself after the third corner defensive move.
Max Verstappen started from the back grid and was seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led for most of the race and did not change tyres to target a quick stop and cross Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He was in the pit on lap 44 but could not improve his speed for the next eight laps when Raikkonen was in fourth place.
A tough day for Valtteri who's made a good race all weekend and a man of conscience allowed me to make the short cut.
The team did a good job of winning first and second place", Hamilton said.
That's the language of the unpleasant movements.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday rally at the urging of a woman who he did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault charges.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly answer the testimony given before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what happened in the Senate showed people to be "cruel and ugly and liars".
"One thing can happen and a beautiful thing happened a few days ago in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see angry and cruel and ugly and lying people", he said.
"When you look at the exposure and the leak and they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it".
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember the answer... did you leak the document-- "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, I did not.
I'm not leaking".
All right, hold on a second.
Did we leak... No, we didn't", he added, making the senator's face look.
Feinstein had sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugholeh Ford last July, and the letter was leaked in September - but Feinstein denied the leak came from his office.
"I'm not denying Dr. Ford's allegations, I'm not leaking his story", Feinstein told the committee, reports The Hill.
"He told me to keep it secret and I kept it secret as requested".
But the woman's denial was displeasing to the president, who commented during Saturday's meeting: "I tell you, that's not good language.
He may not have done that, but that was the worst kind of gesture I've ever seen".
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who had been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats use the charges to achieve their own ends.
"They are determined to regain power by any means.
You see, cruelty, cruelty, they don't care who they hurt, who they sacrifice to gain power and control", Mediaite reported the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 with the Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee star made up for Friday's Elite League defeat against the Belfast Giants by winning back-to-back 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants led by two goals with a shot from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the host position before Dwyer recovered the Giants' victory.
Francois Bouchard matched the points for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen guaranteed a win for them.
This was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's side, who came from below to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This is the fourth meeting of the season between the two sides, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
The opening for Dwyer came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFaull's assist, with David Rutherford providing the lead while Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
With what appeared to be a busy opening hour, Sullivan raised the host at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became assistant to Cownie's equation at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured the Giants won the game during the first half when he scored his second goal that night at the end of the first half.
The hosts then regrouped and Bouchard once again tied the score at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined to help Nielsen give Dundee their first late game win in the second period and he secured the win with the fifth team in the middle of the final period.

Air Traffic Controls Victims to Make Sure Hundreds aboard the Aircraft Pass the Earthquake
The Indonesian Air Traffic Controllers are considered heroes after the crash after ensuring that the plane carrying hundreds of passengers took off.
More than 800 people were killed and many were missing after a massive earthquake hit Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong earthquakes continued to hit the area and many were trapped in the collapse in Palu City.
Although his friend escaped, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan the Great, refused to leave his control post in a strongly shaken control tower at Sis Al Jufri Pearl Airport, Palu.
He did not take steps to ensure that the 6321 Battery Water, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he felt the tower was about to collapse.
He later died in hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We've got a helicopter from Balikpapan in Borneo to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
"Our hearts are broken when we hear this news", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities are concerned the death toll could reach thousands with disaster mitigation agencies saying access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong cities is restricted.
"The death toll is still rising due to the many bodies still under the rubble and many unreachable", agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
A 6 meter high wave has destroyed Palu who will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft will bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings back the body.
Clean water is hard to come by.
Small shops are being renovated everywhere".
Jan Gelfand, International Director of the Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross port is hurrying to provide assistance to the survivors but we don't know what will be found there.
It is a tragedy, but things can get worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you to work day and night to complete every task related to the relocation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake earlier this year in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says a passenger is missing after the plane crashed
The airline operating the plane that crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia now says one passenger is missing, after saying all 47 passengers and crew were safely removed from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon, the company was not sure about the safety of a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passengers, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Authorities said on Friday, seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
What caused the crash and the actual sequence of events is still unclear.
Airlines and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses felt the plane had lost its way.
According to American passenger Bill Jaynes, the plane crashed into the runway in low condition.
"That was a very good thing", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers managed to cross the water as high as the waist to the emergency gate of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming, and he only got a slight head injury.
The Axis navy said crew near the restored pier also provided assistance by using a re-inflatable boat to transport passengers to shore before the plane sank into 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network gives 111 people have been killed in PNG-registered plane crashes in the past two decades but none involving Air Niugini.
Analysts give the nightline the woman was burned alive
Prosecutors reopened the case Saturday in a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligent analysis.
He outlined to the jury how he used cell phone records to organize the movements of the defendant, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night he was killed.
Rowlett said she received some location data from several cell phones showing Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contrary to previous allegations, The Clarion Ledger reports.
When the data showed his cell phone was along with Chambers' phone while he was suing along with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford stood before the court and testified that he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth, that he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he had "cheated because my truck was in Nashville".
Another paradox is that Trellis said he knew Chambers two weeks before the woman died.
Cell phone records show they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said after Chamber's death, Tellis deleted the text of Chamber's calls and contact information from her phone.
"He's erased that woman from his life", said Hale.
The defense attorney's office is scheduled to begin the closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects a jury trial later that afternoon.
The High Breed: Is hip hop sensitive?
The hip hop trio wanted to change the negative outlook of the genre by filling their music with a positive message.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claim hip hop has changed far from its original purpose, which was to send political messages and solve social problems.
They want to get back to basics and make hip hop sensitive popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen the latest resurgence in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York nanny's been chasing a couple who fired her for "racism"
A New York nanny charged the couple with discriminatory termination after receiving a wrongful death text from a mother who complained that she was "another black person".
The couple denied they were racist, calling the act of kindness "harmonization".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her disappointment when she learned that her new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work on her first day in 2016.
"Not a single time in the dark", Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text.
She wanted to send the text to her husband, but instead she sent the text to Maurice, twice.
Realizing his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt uncomfortable, fired Maurice, saying that the previous nanny, an African-American, was not doing the job well and he expected a nanny from the Philippines to attend, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for a day's work and sent home on an Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal, and demanding compensation in the amount of $350 a day for six months, the compensation for the residence he has been offered, despite no contract.
"I want to show them, see, you're not supposed to do that", he told the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's discriminatory".
The couple had responded to their racist allegations, saying the decision to terminate Maurice's service was justified because they felt the woman was untrustworthy after offending the woman's remarks.
"My wife sent me something she didn't mean.
He's not a racist.
We are not racist", Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
"But would you put the care of your child on someone you've abused, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Don't do that".
Describing the act of kindness as "convergence", Plasco said his wife had just given birth to a baby and was in a "secret situation".
"You want to put someone in a situation like that?
Not a good thing", added the investment banker.
During the trial, the court of public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, attacking them for their actions and logic.
Paddington publishers worry that readers will have difficulty communicating with talking bears, a new letter reveals
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was received, said of the letter: "It is difficult to put yourself in the position of the first-time reader before the book was published.
It's sad to hear about Paddington's success".
She said her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write a children's book, a little toy bear, felt optimistic about his work being rejected, the woman added, as the book's 60th anniversary was "bitter sweet" after her father died last year.
Of Paddington, he describes as "the most important expert in our family", he added, his father being proud of his eventual success.
"A father who is silent, he is not a man who likes to talk big", she said.
"But, because Paddington is too alive for him, it's like feeling like you have a child who achieves something you're proud of even if it's not what you made it.
I feel like he saw Paddington's success like that.
Although the bear was his invention and imagination, he always credited Paddington himself".
My son is sick and I have to say goodbye over the phone.
After landing, the girl was rushed to Louis Pasteur Hospital 2, Nice where doctors had worked to save her life.
"Nad called me often to say that the condition was bad and he would not be able to be saved", said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad saying that he was going to die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye to him.
And I did that.
I said, "Tashi, I love you, honey.
Mom will be by your side soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication the doctor gave her to pump her heart out slowly and leave her system.
He died prematurely and this is all turned off.
I just sat there and waited, knowing this was all gonna happen.
I can't roar or scream or cry because I'm in a situation surrounded by family and people.
I had to hold on".
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now in the midst, mourning the loss of her son, boarded a plane with other passengers - who did not know about the bitter experience she had experienced.
"No one knows", he said.
"I bow my head, and tears gush out at all times.
It's hard to describe, but along the way I felt a sense of sympathy for Nad.
She needs my love and understanding.
I know how much he loves her".
Sad woman sends postcards to avoid suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones who committed suicide, working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted a letter on the Welsh Bridge with an inspirational message and phone number to contact for support.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any mother to feel the way I feel every day", she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said his son was a potential gymnast with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always say her smile can turn any room on".
However, he stopped working before he died, because he was in "a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, met his brother after his brother committed suicide.
Davis said: "I feel constantly worried if this will cause the effects of other things to happen".
Davis invented the card, "to let people know that there are people you can meet and talk to, even if they're a friend.
Don't just sit in silence - you need to talk".
Mrs. Humphreys, who had been friends with Mrs. Davies for many years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after Mark's mother died.
"He didn't tell me that he felt sad or depressed or anything", she said.
"A few days before Christmas we saw a change in his disposition.
She was so sad on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their presents, she didn't look at them or anything".
She said that the death of her partner was a major trauma for them, but they had to let it go: "It makes a big hole in the family.
It's what separated us.
But we have to go on and fight".

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance when the FBI starts investigating.
"I think, if we can get what he wants - a limited time investigation, a limited scope - we can bring to unity", Flake said on Sunday, adding that the committee "knocked-out" in the deadlock is based on a belief that has been rooted in the mud.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI investigating?
Their aversion is to digestion.
The midterm elections are just five weeks away, and on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republican results are not satisfactory, they will become weaker to get the person they want nominated to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has made a call to the Senate, lobbying them to support Kavanaugh, who had worked at the White House for Bush and through Bush had met his wife Ashley, who became Bush's secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares a report?
The vote will be held in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are in session.
It's not clear whether Kavanaugh will get 50 votes from the Senate, which will allow Mike Pence, vice president, to tie the series and confirm his position on the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean rebels is down Kim
The number of North Korean rebels to South Korea has been declining since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, according to South Korean lawmakers.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the southern union ministry, said there were 1,127 dissidents last year - compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said stricter border controls between North Korea and China and high rates of human trafficking were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Most of the North Korean refugees will be offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the Military Free Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers the refugees illegal immigrants rather than political refugees and often sends them back by force.
Relations between the North and the South - technically still at war - have improved over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the heads of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks centered on the postponed expansion of nuclear power.
This came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in common sense to move toward nuclear freedom on the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused US sanctions of slowing negotiations since the incident.
"Without any trust from the US, our national security is not guaranteed and therefore, we will not initiate nuclear disarmament first", Ri said in his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "emotional", and it's inappropriate to act in the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "emotional" and said his performance was not appropriate for holding office in the Senate.
Pelosi made the following comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Party in Austin, Texas.
"I believe that if a woman behaves like that, they'll call her 'emotional,'" Pelosi said of the reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During the opening credits, Kavanaugh was emotionally drawn, sometimes almost screaming and crying when discussing family and while in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him "excessive and well-planned smear" run by the still angry liberal Hilary Clinton defeated in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony confirmed that he was ineligible to hold a seat on the Supreme Court, as it showed that he was biased against Democrats.
"I feel like he's lost his own dignity and his actions against the Clintons and Democrats", she said.
Pelosi was hesitant when asked if he would try to sue Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'd say this -- if he didn't speak the truth to Congress and the FBI, he's not eligible to hold a position on the Supreme Court, but only in the court he's in now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he was worried about Kavanaugh's decision against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was considered a conservative court.
In the confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided answering whether he would reverse the Supreme Court's ruling.
"This is not the time for an emotionally biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'How fun,'" Pelosi said.
And women need to show it.
It was a fitting insult, a month-long and year-long inflammation, and he could not hold back his anger without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't feel it's anything extraordinary, do you agree?"
He continued, "I was helped by a woman, an executive at one place, who said she cried when she was angry, but had invented a technique, if she was angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm getting mad".
Then he went on.
And I think that's a wise suggestion".
Crying is allowed as a way to channel anger because it is always misunderstood.
One of the most memorable memories of my old job, in a male-dominated office, I found myself crying with an uncontrollable sense of anger, drawn by an older woman at the neck - a cold handyman I was chasing - dragged me into the stairwell.
"Don't show them your tears", he told me.
"They don't know you're a rat.
They think you're sad and they're going to be happy that they've made you sad".
Patricia Schroeder, formerly a congresswoman from Colorado, once worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was arrested for secretly engaging in a boat called Monkey Business out of the contest, Ms. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, felt there was no reason to prevent her from joining the presidential campaign.
"It wasn't a carefully planned decision", she said laughing at me 30 years later.
"There are seven more candidates running and they don't need another candidate.
Some call it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because of the events that happened at the end of the campaign, the woman missed out on trying to establish a pipeline, and she vowed not to compete until she got $2 million.
It was a futile struggle.
He found his supporters who gave a man $1,000 would give him only $250.
"Do they feel I'm being discounted?" he says.
When he said he wasn't going to launch a formal campaign, he felt a variety of emotions - gratitude to those who supported him, frustration with the system that made it difficult for him to solicit donations and target non-candidate voters, and anger at sexism - and he felt overwhelmed.
"You'd think I was having a heart attack", Schroeder recalled of the way the media reacted to him.
"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking back then, what would I put on my pebble?
"She was crying"?""
The US-China trade war may be beneficial to Beijing
The explosion of the beginning of the US-China Trade War may be confusing, and even if the fighting is not over yet, the dispute between the two countries may benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US President, issued his first warning earlier this year by imposing taxes on Chinese exports including solar panels, iron and aluminum.
The biggest increase came this week with new tariffs that would impact $200 billion worth of items, such as taxing half of the goods imported into the US from China.
Beijing responds in the same way every time, most recently, it imposes tariffs of five to ten percent on 60 billion American goods.
China has vowed to retaliate every American for their actions, and the world's second-largest economy is not impressed.
To make Washington back means submitting to the will of the United States, but submitting to the United States is considered too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
According to experts, if Beijing plays the cards correctly, the U.S. trade war pressure could support China positively in the long run by reducing the interdependence between the two countries.
"The swift political decision by either Washington or Beijing could start an uncontrolled economic situation in any country and seem more dangerous than what observers have previously realized", said Abigail Grace, a research fellow focusing on Asia at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'ready' for political refugees to return, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the return of the country's willing political refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country devastated by the seven-year war.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country is improving.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made to fight terrorism", he said.
The government will continue to restore areas destroyed by terrorists to normalcy.
The situation is now ready for the return of willing refugees, to the countries they were forced to leave due to the violence and unilateral economic measures that affect their daily lives and their search for a better future.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled since the war began in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to build the ruined country.
But he insisted the country would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries supporting the rebellion.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA by a final score of 16.5, 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has now lost six straight games on European soil and hasn't won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of Captain Denmark, Thomas Bjorn, scored the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, struggling throughout the match, dropped a tee shot into the water in the par-3 16th hole, giving up a loss to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfers excelled in all rounds, becoming one of four players to be 5-0-0 since the tournament format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was pulled out in the 5&4 by the lowest placed player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's top player, Dustin Johnson, is down 2nd and 1st to Ian Poulter of England who may play his last Ryder Cup.
Eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, Spanish player Sergio Garcia became the all-time winner of Europe with a top score of 25.5.
"I rarely cried but couldn't hold out today.
This has been a tough year.
I'm grateful Thomas chose me and trusted me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the trophy back.
This is for the team, and I'm happy to help", Garcia said after the European semi-final.
He has handed over the assignment to John Ram who defeated US legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game on Sunday.
"The pride I felt, when I beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him play", says 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all of his matches in France and currently holds a Ryder Cup career record of 13-21-3.
Strange statistics by one of the greatest players, winning 14 major championships second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find a course, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a good game of golf throughout the game.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of them, they've worked hard.
There was a time this morning we gave a boost to the European team.
We're doing our best.
Congratulations to you, Thomas.
He's a good captain.
All 12 of his players played brilliantly.
We'll get back together, I'll work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup committee and we'll move on.
I love all 12 of these men and I'm proud to be captain.
You need to lift your hat.
We have been defeated".
