Members of the Welsh Assembly concerned that they should be identified as Muppets
Several members of the assembly have expressed their dismay at the proposal to change their title by MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Welsh parliament).
This controversy has taken root in the plan to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly from all the different political parties have expressed concern that this measure could become a source of ridicule.
A Labour party assembly member has said his party was concerned that MWP was merging with Twp or Pwp.
For non-Welsh readers: In Welsh, twp means stupid and, pwp, excrement.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party assembly has commented that his party as a whole does not see this with good eyes and has proposed several alternatives.
A Welsh conservative member has said his group was "obviously" opposed to the name change, but also commented that there is too little difference between the terms "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, it must be said that the letter w in Welsh is pronounced similarly to the letter u in English from Yorkshire.
According to the committee of the assembly charged with drafting the legal draft to introduce the name changes: The final decision on any qualification to name the Members of the assembly will of course fall on the members themselves.
The Welsh Government's 2017 Act grants the Welsh Assembly all the power to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with broad support for the proposal to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the members of the assembly, although the committee was chosen by Members of the Welsh Parliament or WPM, the option of MWP was the one that received wider support in the public consultation.
Apparently, members of the assembly are suggesting different alternatives, however, the attempt to reach a consensus may be a complete curse on the Speaker of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to present the legal draft on the changes in a matter of weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on disqualifying its members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the assembly will hold the final vote on their denomination during the debate related to legislation.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum on changing their country's name
Citizens will choose Sunday whether or not they want to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular consultation was decided in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which already has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a way of claiming its territory and has repeatedly opposed its attempts to become part of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgy Ivanov, opposed to the plebiscite on the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's stop ringing: the difficulties of the churches of Harlem
"Historically, the older people I've talked to say there was a bar and a church on every corner", Mr. Adams says.
Today, there's no one left of either.
According to Adams, the disappearance of bars can be understood.
"People have a different way of socializing today", she says.
"Bars have ceased to be the kind of neighborhood living room where people used to go regularly".
As for the churches, he worries that the money raised from the sale of assets will not last as long as their leaders predict and that they will eventually return to where they came from.
Churches, he adds, could end up being replaced by apartment buildings and condominiums with the kind of people who will be of no help to the remaining temples in the neighborhood.
The vast majority of people who buy condos in these buildings will be white, he says, and so what they will do is speed up the closure of all churches, as it is highly unlikely that most people who move into these condos will end up being members of these churches.
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis; the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The white Methodist congregation that had originally existed left during the 1930s.
A black congregation nearby acquired the property.
St. Martin's passed into the hands of a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, one of Harlem's main shopping streets, who resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire caused severe damage to the building, and when Reverend Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it, it was then that they commissioned the trailer.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's Church, proudly described the streetcar as "the bells of the poor".
The expert who made the cartoon sound in July described it differently: A cultural treasure and an irreplaceable historical instrument.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first carriage that was played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had to move to the largest carriage at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has been played out at St. Martin's over the past few months, on the contrary, have been the complicated stories of architects and contractors, some of them carried by lay church leaders and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The council, the governing body of the parish, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese last July expressing its concern that the diocese would "try to transmit costs" to the council, although the latter was not involved in the hiring of the architects and contractors the diocese sent.
Some parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark wounds a 13-year-old boy while searching for worms in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving to search for lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, authorities said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he spent half an hour browsing with friends on Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming for help.
Hammel says that he first thought it was the joy of catching a lobster, but then realized that he was yelling 'I've been bitten!
I've been bitten!'
He had his entire clavicle stripped, Hammel observed as he reached the boy.
"Because everyone is coming out of the water, I shouted, 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel adds.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
It is not known which shark species was responsible for the attack.
In a press conference, rescue worker Larry Giles commented that a few weeks ago a shark had been detected in the area, but that it was decided that the species was not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities blocked access to beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours due to investigation and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of shark in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans for the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's has decided to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty product outlets in the style of large warehouses occupied by specialized employees.
These big leaps are just part of a considerable investment in the UK beauty market, a market that moves around £2.8 billion and continues to grow as the fashion and home goods sectors fall behind, and will be tested in 11 stores across the country to expand to more stores next year if the trial is a success.
The investment in beauty products is the product of the greed of supermarkets to take advantage of the space in their lenders that was previously intended for televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's claims it will double its beauty offering to offer up to 3,000 different products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees ranges also receive more space with brand areas similar to those found in shops such as Boots.
The supermarket company is also in the process of rollout of its Boutique makeup lineup so that most products are now vegan-friendly, an aspect increasingly sought after by younger consumers.
The fragrance shop will also open concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first last week in Croydon, south London, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the shift to a habit of buying food in smaller quantities every day at small supermarkets has made large supermarkets have to find other ways to convince people to come.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, stores will increasingly resemble large warehouses in a supermarket chain effort to fight off discount supermarkets Aldi and Lidl with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has been introducing Argos outlets to many of its supermarkets, as well as a number of Habitat stores since acquiring both chains two years ago, which, he says, has served to re-launch retailer sales and increase profitability of acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to relaunch its beauty and pharmacy departments resulted in a failure.
Sainsbury's ran a joint-operation trial with Boots in the early 2000s, but it all ended up in a hasty disagreement over how to divide the benefits of the chain of pharmacies within the supermarket.
This new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-pharmacy business three years ago to Celesio, owner of the LloydsPharmacy chain, for £125 million.
According to Sainsbury's, Lloyds will play a major role in the global plan, as it will expand the range of luxury brands of leather products, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's Chief Commercial Officer, comments: "We've transformed the look of our beauty products to improve the face environment for our customers.
We have invested in specially trained workers who will be of great help in providing counselling.
Our range of brands is designed to suit any need; on the other hand, the attractive environment and convenient location make us now one of the preferred destinations for beauty products and challenge the traditional way of shopping.
Peter Jones  furious after Holly Willoughby backs off a £11 million deal
Dragons' Den star Peter Jones left furiously after TV presenter Holly Willoughby was backed by an £11 million deal with Jones' lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to devote himself to the Truly joint home goods and accessories business.
The business of these two media personalities had come to be compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host used Instagram to announce her march.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' star Peter Jones furious at the last minute withdrawal from the lucrative lifestyle brand joint venture to focus on her new own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will also bring her big profits.
According to various sources, Jones was furious when the red star of television admitted, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at her empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the presenter's new deal, worth £1.5 million, implied that she would no longer have enough time to devote to the joint brand of household products and accessories Truly.
The business had come to be compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and aspired to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at £11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby used Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones took a private plane to one of his holiday residences outside the UK.
According to one source, Truly was by far Holly's top priority.
It was meant to be her long-term future and where we would see her for the next 20 or 30 years.
His decision to back down left all parties involved speechless.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, we were so close to launch...
Right now there's a warehouse full of merchandise at their Marlow headquarters ready to be sold.
Experts say the departure of the This Morning presenter, one of the UK's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions because of the significant investment in products ranging from pillows and lighters to clothing and homewares, and the possibility of delays in its launch.
Moreover, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin had maintained an intimate relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as president last March.
Both couples spend the holidays together.
Willoughby will be M&S's next brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones commented last night that "We will not comment on his business".
Hard accusations... and then we fell in love
He joked about the possible criticism he received from the media for making a comment that some would consider "not proper for a president" and for having such a positive opinion of the North Korean leader.
Why has Trump resigned so long?
Trump claimed, all while mocking the tone of a news anchor's voice:
I've given up on nothing.
He noted that Kim was interested in holding a second meeting after the first held in Singapore in June was declared a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on denuclearization are stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho commented on Saturday to leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "corresponding response" from the US to its first disarmament initiatives.
However, he noted, the US continues to apply sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump's viewpoint, on the other hand, was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We're doing very well with North Korea", he said.
We were going to declare war on North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
And now we're maintaining this great relationship.
Trump said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: end of missile tests, help to free hostages and return home of American soldiers' remains.
And he defended his unusual approach to talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded building, we would have about 200 people", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
A devastated island and hundreds of deaths from a tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations in other countries were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population had to be displaced, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite to catalyze international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so the situation is very demanding", says Ms Sumbung.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it's not yet certain that foreigners will be able to work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, commented that Indonesian authorities were evaluating the situation in Palu to see whether or not international agencies are allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Given the constant earthquakes that Indonesia suffers, the country is unfortunately still unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not common on other coasts.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, although there was a warning in effect, is likely to have contributed to the death toll.
Moving between the huge number of islands in Indonesia is, at best, a challenge.
And natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was docked in Lombok to attend to the earthquake victims is now headed to Palu; however, it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo had as a central element of his election campaign the improvement of Indonesia's poor infrastructure, and has invested huge amounts of money in roads and railways.
However, Joko's government faces re-election next year loaded with funding shortfalls.
Joko is also facing pressure from the country's ongoing sectarian tensions, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative faith in Cairo.
More than 1,000 deaths and tens of thousands of displaced people are the result of street fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs using batons, bows and arrows, and other bloody weapons.
Note: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool scores the half-century goal with a long shot against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with his goal scored in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 metres from Chelsea's goalkeeper when his team was losing 1-0.
He put the ball to the left before letting go of an incredible shot directed at the second pole.
The shot crossed the entire area with a large elevation as it was propelled towards the right crest of the porch.
The ball finally began the descent over a full-leaping Kepa Arrizabalaga to try to stop it and ended up at the bottom of the net.
"I was just trying to get to that position to be able to shoot, and players like Shaqiri always played it forward as much as possible, so I tried to create as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kanté coming, I made a touch and didn't think much about it, I just dedicated myself to shooting.
Chelsea won 1-0 at the break after scoring a goal in the 25th minute by their Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In the play, the Blue team's forward returned a pass to Mateo Kovacic before sinking from almost halfway through the field and sprinting towards Liverpool's field.
Kovacic made a quick combination from the middle of the field.
He then made a magnificent deep pass, which left Hazard inside the area with the ball under control.
Hazard overcame the defence to finish the second leg with a shot with his left leg where Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker could not reach.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage next Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea, for their part, will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Death toll from the Indonesian tsunami reaches 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, according to data from the country's disaster agency released Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the collapsed buildings runoff due to the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that occurred on Friday and caused waves of up to 6 meters, according to agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho in a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was completely covered by the ruins of the destroyed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after finding a woman stabbed
The murder investigation has been launched after the woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with multiple gunshot wounds in Grayson Mews, John Street; a 32-year-old man was subsequently arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked residents of the area if they have seen or heard anything related to the crime to report to the authorities.
According to Detective Brian O'Hagan, "Although the investigation is still in its early stages, I would like to call on anyone who is near John Street in Birkenhead and has seen or heard anything suspicious, to contact us immediately.
I would also like to call on anyone, especially taxi drivers who have been able to capture anything through the camera on the dashboard, to contact me, as they could have vital information for the investigation.
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
As the investigation continues, police have commented that they are informing the victim's immediate family members of the incident.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but police told him no one was allowed in or out of the building.
When he learned what had happened, he was speechless.
Residents are being warned that it will be hours before they can re-enter.
It could be felt as a police officer explaining to a man that the entire area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the stage crying.
He keeps saying, "It's terrible!"
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were inside the area agreed with another van parked outside.
A number of Romanian agents were inside the agreed area controlling the block of flats.
Anyone who may have information is requested to send a message directly to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously by calling 0800 555 111 and mentioning file 247 of September 30.
The statue of Cromwell in the British Parliament becomes the last monument affected by the debate around rewrite history
Their disappearance would be a kind of poetic justice for the Taliban's purest style of destruction of so many cultural and religious objects in England perpetrated by their fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society has described Crick's proposal as a "bogeria" and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, comments: "In the current debate around the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster would become one of the main objectives.
The iconography of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps he would end up sacrificing the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor during the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testament to 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure still believed by many to be worthy of commemoration.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more late in the 19th century than not now, as a defender of parliament in the face of external pressure, in his obvious case of the monarchy.
Whether or not this fact constitutes a fully accurate representation remains a subject of historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure who represents a side of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.
A murderous pig wounds a Chinese farmer to death
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, local sources report.
The man, identified only by his surname Yuan, was found dead with a carved and blood-covered artery near a pig yard at the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to inject vaccines into pigs at a courtyard in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that opened to a nearby pig yard.
According to him, there was a large male pig in the court with blood in his mouth.
Forensic examination confirmed that the 250-kg garrison had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin had broken legs and blood", said the cousin, nicknamed "Wu", as quoted in the Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his cousin.
One of the market officials commented on the evening news that the pig was kept locked and isolated to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police gathered evidence at the crime scene.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although very rare, previously there have been cases of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a nearly 300-pound pig grabbed a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife could scare the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC news that pigs are usually not aggressive but that blood taste can act as a "trigger".
They like to play.
They're like kids, they're very curious... they don't go with the idea of hurting.
All we have to do is give them the respect they deserve, he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rains across the southwestern United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it advances over the colder waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, the Rose will bring torrential rains throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
The storm had winds of 138 km/h, proper to a Category 1 hurricane, at 5:00 a.m. eastern time on Sunday, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression is beginning to form in the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward toward the U.S. west coast. When Rose approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to leave a strong tropical moisture heading northward toward the southwestern United States.
The Rosa will leave up to 250 mm of rain on Monday in parts of Mexico.
Subsequently, tropical moisture will interact with the approaching depression to generate widespread torrential rainfall throughout the southwest over the next few days.
At various points, the 25 to 100 mm of rainfall will cause dangerous rivers, waste streams and the possibility of land erosion in the desert.
The strong tropical moisture will cause rainfall of about 50 to 75 mm per hour at several points, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
50 to 100 mm of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially much of Arizona.
There is a possibility of rivers forming, as the situation is deteriorating very rapidly due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
It is highly discouraged to walk into the desert in the face of the threat of tropical rain.
Torrential rains could cause gorges to become uncontrolled rivers, and storms can bring wind gusts and dust clouds to specific points.
The approaching depression will bring torrential rains to certain points along the southern California coast.
It is possible that total precipitation above 50 mm is recorded, which could lead to smaller waste streams and creaky paths.
It would be the first rainfall of the rainy season in the region.
Tropical rain-isolated soaps will begin arriving in Arizona between Sunday night and Monday morning, before rain becomes more widespread between Monday and Tuesday nights.
Torrential rains will spread to the Four Corners region on Tuesday and continue through Wednesday.
In October there will be several significant temperature fluctuations throughout the U.S. as the Arctic cooled, although the tropics will remain fairly warm.
This phenomenon can sometimes cause drastic temperature changes within a short distance.
The central region of the United States on Sunday is a clear example of drastic temperature differences.
Temperature differences of nearly 20 degrees have been recorded between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the persistent summer heat will try to expand again.
October is expected to begin with a warm month in much of the central and eastern U.S. with temperatures around 27 degrees from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
According to the long-term weather forecast, there are many possibilities for above-average temperatures to be recorded in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's statement.
More than 20 million viewers watched Thursday the passionate testimony of Supreme Court Justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, which allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued, with broadcasters interrupting their usual Friday programming due to a last-minute turn of events: an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford explained to the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh touched her drunken and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an exalted testimony, stated that he was absolutely convinced that this never happened.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million viewers likely watched this testimony on Friday.
The company averaged viewership for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Audience numbers were not immediately available for other networks that broadcast the testimony, such as PBS, C-SPAN or Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen often has trouble calculating how many people see it from his office.
Put in perspective, it's an audience similar to an American football playoff game or the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders have clearly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was the most-watched channel, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the all-day testimony, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS earned 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen data.
Interest remains high after the witness.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement saying they would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, Flake was caught by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as he was surprised by protesters as he tried to climb an elevator to attend a Judiciary Committee hearing.
Flake remained several minutes blindfolded while being picked up live on television on CNN.
"Here I am, in front of you", said a woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
They told him, "You have power, while there are so many women who don't!"
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors were closed, commented that he would have more to say in the committee's view.
Within hours, all cable and broadcast networks were already broadcasting live the moment the Judiciary Committee was to vote on whether or not to proceed with Kavanaugh's appointment to the full Senate to put it to a vote.
Flake said, however, that he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominee next week, a condition demanded by the Democratic minority.
Flake was convinced in part by conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a subsequent conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was influential, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to support Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" in relation to Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with the future of the UK and of disregarding national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party congress in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview in addition to May's front page, former May Foreign Minister Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, where he claims that the proposal that the UK and EU collect taxes on each other is "absolutely absurd".
The shooting death of Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspicious Dyteon Simpson for the death of the LSU team player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who was a member of the LSU team.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and sent to prison on second-degree murder charges, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released a video of Sims and Simpson's confrontation, which police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the scene of the crime and claim they found Simpson's DNA in them, according to CBS affiliate WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, he admitted to shooting Wayde to death, according to police.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The East Baton Rouge County coroner's office released a preliminary report Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police's fugitive task force, the state police's forensics lab, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area for their assistance in the investigation that culminated in this arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva expressed his gratitude to the area's law enforcement for their diligence and for seeking justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
He was a 6-foot-1, 195-pound wide receiver who grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player for the LSU team.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds to start last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade commented that the team is "disappointed" and that Wayde's death was "once very strong".
"Things like this are what make you suffer all the time", Wade said.
A Spitfire Ashes Mexico City
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico City.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity was detected in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded in a 24-hour period.
The center was monitoring several recent seizures and tremors.
Images on social media showing a thin layer of ash on the windshields of cars in neighborhoods like Mexico City's Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in volcanic activity 72 km southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists shortly before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona last Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with anti-value police and thousands joined counter-demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the vote in Catalonia on its secession.
A group of independents detained by the anti-money laundering police began throwing eggs and painting in dust, which caused the appearance of dark clouds of dust on the streets normally overrun by tourists.
Later that day, clashes broke out with police, who used their fears to contain violent protesters.
For several hours, independence groups sang "Don't forget, don't forgive" face to face with unionist protesters who chanted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were taken into custody for minor injuries sustained during the protests, local sources said.
Tensions have not diminished in this region of independence-mindedness a year after a referendum held on October 1 that Madrid considered illegal but also carried out by Catalan separatists.
Voters chose independence by a wide majority, although the turnout was low, as opposition to secession largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in electoral colleges across the region, sparking violent clashes.
The independence groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration took place in the same way, but the protesters were forced to take another route.
Narcís Termes, a 68-year-old electrician and one of the participants in the independence demonstration along with his wife, said he no longer had much hope about the possibilities that Catalonia will achieve independence.
"Last year was one of our best.
I saw my parents cry for joy because they were able to vote, but now we're stuck together, she commented.
Despite achieving a vital, albeit marginal, victory in the last December's autonomous elections, Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, as many of their main leaders are in self-imposed exile or detained awaiting trial for their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, records the demonstration in support of the police with his phone, and claims the conflict has been sparked by politicians on both sides.
"The tension is only rising", he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders jailed before trial since the end of last year, announced he would contest the European Parliament elections next year.
Presenting as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the setback in democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish government, he says.
London: Men arrested after they invested a house with a car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car repeatedly hit a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 19:30 local time.
Inspector Bob Blemmings says damage was done to the doors and the building itself.
It is also possible that at some point someone fired a racket into the car.
A Menga play gives Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal against Livingston meant victory
Livingston, who had risen through the ranks this year, surprised the Glasgow Rangers in what is just Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as coach of the Ibrox neighbourhood club.
Dolly Menga's move made the difference, as with this win, Gary Holt's team takes second place, which they share with the Hibernian.
Gerrard's side, on the other hand, continue to win the Premiership without a home win this season.
But before that, the Rangers are getting the Vienna Rapid this Thursday in the Europa League.
Livingston, meanwhile, extends his undefeated streak to six games in the league, with a Holt as coach who still doesn't know what a loss is since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston doesn't take advantage of its opportunities in front of the live game of visitors
Holt's team should have gone ahead of the scorer long before the goal, given that his direct play caused all sorts of problems at Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his way through the defense, but missed his opportunity when he found himself in front of the goalkeeper.
Local residents were already well off letting the Rangers approach their area, as they knew they could get visitors into trouble in isolated games.
And that's how this decisive goal came about.
The referee closed a foul against Rangers interests and Livingston made an opening to the band, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined so Menga could play first and finish from the central part of the area.
Up until that point, the Rangers had dominated the possession, but they found themselves with an impenetrable defense and a goalkeeper Liam Kelly who had very little work to do throughout the game,
The scene was repeated in the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a stop-over.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor stopped Scott Pittman on one occasion and Lithgow ended up deflecting another combined move from Livingston.
The Rangers were forced to hang one and two other riders in the Livingston area, only to be rejected.
Livingston phenomenal: analysis
Alasdair Lamont of the BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and great performance for the Livingston.
One man thinks they were excellent, and they're still exceeding all expectations on this upward trajectory.
His playing style and staff have barely changed since his return to the top category, although much of the merit has to be attributed to Holt for the way he has galvanized the team since his arrival.
There was a good bunch of heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, leading a perfectly organized defense, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall had to be hanging from Menga throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked inspiration, though.
Despite the bright moments displayed with Gerrard as coach, they definitely haven't been able to keep up.
They failed to create opportunities (only once did they clearly overcome the local defense), and this the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table, should take as a warning.
A warm welcome for Erdogan in Cologne
It was all smiles and clear skies on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aimed to repair relations between the two NATO allies.
These had deteriorated due to issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then moved to Cologne to inaugurate a new giant mosque.
And it's that this city has the largest Turkish population in the world outside of Turkey.
Police alleged security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, although a large crowd of followers clung to the surrounding area to see its president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also made themselves heard as they condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Both demonstrations reflect the division of opinion that exists around the visitor, considered a hero by some German Turks and titled dictator by others.
Deptford traffic accident: a cyclist dies after being hit by a car
A cyclist has been killed in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a heavily-trafficked area of Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 a.m. local time.
The driver of the vehicle stopped and, although paramedics attended the cyclist, he died on the spot.
The accident comes months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run accident on Childers Street, 1.6 km from the crash site on Saturday.
Metropolitan police said their agents are working to identify the man and report the incident to the closest family members.
The street has been cut and bus routes have been diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in an altercation
Six prison officials were injured in an altercation at this high-security men's prison, according to the center's office.
The incidents occurred at Long Lartin Prison, Worcestershire, around 09:30 local time on Sunday, and still ongoing.
Specialised agents moved to the scene to put an end to the altercation, in which eight inmates were seen involved.
Officers had to be held for minor facial injuries at the scene.
According to a prison service spokesman: "We deployed specially trained prison staff to try to solve an incident at Long Martin Prison, which is still ongoing.
Six employees have had to be treated with wounds.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are clear that those responsible for this riot will be held accountable to the police and may have to spend even more time in the garrison.
The Long Lartin Penitentiary has more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was learned that the head of the prison had to be taken to a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, anti-money laundering agents took a prison tour to resolve a serious altercation in which center personnel were attacked with billiards balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with significant flooding (drought-prone areas could benefit)
It's not unusual for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early next week when what's left of Hurricane Rosa passes through the southwestern desert, with the consequent risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Mondays and Tuesdays in western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The Rose is expected to arrive directly in Phoenix on Tuesday and to appropriate the rainy Monday night.
The Phoenix National Weather Service commented in a pile that only two tropical cyclones have maintained storm or tropical depression status within a 322 km radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) remained 64 km from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the national hurricane center predict 50 to 100 mm of rainfall, with isolated points where up to 150 mm would be recorded in the Mogollon of Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central Rocalloses and the Great Basin, could record 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated points up to 100 mm.
For areas that are not at risk of flooding, the rainfall from the Rose River could be very good news, given that the region is suffering from a severe drought.
Although rivers are a serious cause for concern, some of the precipitation could be very beneficial, as the southwest region is currently suffering a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Control Service, more than 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, reports weather.com.
But first, Hurricane Rosa will make landfall on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
The storm continued to have strong winds on Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 137 km/h, and is now 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm is finding cooler waters in the Pacific, which causes it to lose strength.
So it is expected to touch land in Mexico with strong tropical storm power on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rainfall in different parts of Mexico could be strong, with a considerable risk of flooding.
According to weather.com, 75 to 150 mm of total rainfall is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with the possibility of reaching up to 250 mm.
After that, the Rose will head north across Mexico in a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning in a tropical depression, finally crossing the state of Arizona and reaching southern Utah early Tuesday night.
The main risk we expect from the Rose or what remains of it are very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the desert of the southwestern United States, according to the National Hurricane Center.
Rainfall is expected to cause dangerous rivers and waste streams into deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with multiple stab wounds in Somerset.
The teen was found with wounds in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 a.m. local time on Saturday.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he is staying.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested the following day in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset Police.
The agents have made a call for anyone who may have some sort of recording of the events with their cell phone to contact them.
Trump says Kavanaugh has suffered the misery and anger of the Democratic Party
The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote of no support for the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party, Trump decreed in an election act in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has suffered the misery and anger of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress Thursday, forcefully and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation of sexually abusing her decades ago, when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing in relation to his defendant.
The president said Saturday that the American people saw Kavanaugh's genius, human quality and bravery.
"The vote to ratify Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to ratify one of the brightest minds in the legal world of our time, a lawyer with an admirable career of service to the citizens", he told a crowd of sympathizers from West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's appointment while discussing the importance of the Republican voter turnout index in the midterm elections.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I didn't run, but I actually did, he said.
That's why I'm going everywhere fighting for our great candidates.
Trump argued that Democrats are dedicated to resisting and obstructing.
The first key procedural vote to be held in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place as late as Friday, an assistant to the Republican party leaders told CNN.
Hundreds of deaths from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, where casualties continue to rise
At least 384 people have died, many of them dragged by the giant waves hitting the beaches, due to a severe earthquake and tsunami that has hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday for a beach festival in the city of Palu when waves of up to six metres hit the coast in the evening, dragging many people to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still doing their beach activities and didn't run immediately, so they became victims", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the BNPB disaster mitigation agency in a statement in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, destroyed everything on the ground", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved over open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before impacting the coast.
Some people climbed a tree to escape the tsunami and survived, she says.
Some 16,700 people had to be evacuated to 24 different centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster mitigation agency showing the number of destroyed shops and buildings, spinning and collapsing bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Replicas continued to shake this coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian technology appraisal and application agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the intense earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to the agency, the geographical features of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have exponentially increased the magnitude of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "considerable" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims, he says, were found trapped between the collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were lost.
According to Nugroho, deaths and damage could increase on the coast some 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications were completely paralyzed and therefore no information came from Donggala, says Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its workers and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, which unfortunately could end much worse", he says.
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for failing to report the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although officials said the waves came during the time the warning was issued.
In a video shared on social media by a fan, you can hear a man on the top floor of a building screaming desperately to warn people on the street about the impending tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water bursts into the sea, taking away buildings and vehicles.
Reuters was unable to immediately authenticate the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused a widespread cut in power supply that has disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue tasks.
Although the military has begun sending humanitarian aid by cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say the evacuees continue to desperately need food, in addition to other basic needs.
The city's airport has reopened only for auxiliary purposes and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is over 800.
The situation is very serious.
Although World Vision workers in Donggala were able to reach the city of Palu safely, where employees are housed in canvas shelters installed in the courtyard of their office, they had to witness scenes of total destruction along the way, Doseba says.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed", he said.
It's a disaster.
Although aid groups made the sad gesture of initiating relief efforts, some people complained that humanitarian workers were being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign fundraising, provisions and staffing can only begin to flow if the site of a disaster is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial disaster", said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says, "Well, it's a national disaster", we can start asking for international assistance, but that level hasn't been declared yet.
As it was the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami that occurred on Friday, the friends and family of the missing people held the hope that the miracle would occur and their loved ones would evade the heartbreaking account of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a kid trapped in a ditch was rescued.
On Sunday, rescue teams released a woman who had been buried under the rune for two days with her mother's body by her side.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
In addition to Mr. Mandagi, among the people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
"As a senior in the parapet field, I have my own emotional burden", he pointed out.
Mr. Gendon explained that in the hours following the news of the Roa Roa hotel's collapse among the parapente community, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to competitors from Palu who were participating in the beach festival.
However, messages appeared with a gray verification mark instead of a blue double mark.
"I think that means the messages were not received", he added.
Some thieves take away $26,750 while filling up an ATM in Newport on the Levee
Last Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who was filling out an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release issued by the Newport Police Department.
Agent Dennis McCarthy indicated in the statement that the driver of the vehicle was emptying the ATM at the entertainment complex and was preparing it to distribute more money.
While doing his job, another man rushed to Brink's employee and stole a bag of money intended for distribution.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of those involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
On Saturday, while announcing the change on Twitter, he wrote: "Formerly known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been using the alias Ye for some time, and used it as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before her appearance on Saturday Night Live, in which she is expected to present her new album, titled Yandhi.
The rapper replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation for emotional reasons, according to the show's author.
Apart from being an abbreviation of his current artistic name, West had previously commented that the word has a religious meaning to him.
"I think ye is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you", West said earlier this year, speaking about the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So it's you, it's us.
I've gone from Kanye, which means the one, to just Ye, which is a reflection of our good side, our bad side, our confused side, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
West is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known by several names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former West collaborator, has taken his last name with or without a script and in upper case.
Mexico's president, AMLO, promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's president-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians, as the country soon marks the 50th anniversary of a bloody crackdown on students.
López Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that "military force will never be used again to repress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire during a peaceful demonstration and killed 300 people at a time when left-wing student student movements were taking root across Latin America.
López Obrador, who has pledged to support young Mexicans by granting monthly student grants and opening more free public universities,
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities make young people attracted to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double the amount of AI funding.
While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount of money it spends on research in this field, says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and artificial intelligence professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several members of the US government announced measures on AI, despite the country's general lack of formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: its goal is to become the world's No. 1 AI innovator by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that the rest of the world is way behind the US and we want to be the pioneers of the next advances in AI", Lee said.
"Doubling funding could double the chances for the US to achieve the next big discovery in AI", Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China's leading AI companies.
In 1980 he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that surpassed the American Othello player with the best rating and, later, served as an executive at Microsoft Research and as president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee positively evaluated previous U.S. government technological competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Robotics Challenge, and wondered when the next one would take place in order to identify the next visionaries.
"Sometimes, American researchers have to work hard to get public grants", Lee said.
According to Lee, it's not China that takes academic leaders; it's the companies.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university dignitaries to work in the field of AI.
Lee commented that the U.S. AI work could also be driven by changes in immigration policy.
I think permanent residence cards should be automatically offered to PhD students at IA, he added.
In July 2017, the State Council of China presented its latest generation artificial intelligence development plan.
The National Science Foundation of China grants scholarships to people from academic institutions in the same way that the Natural Science Foundation and other U.S. public agencies give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is inferior to China, Lee noted.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, designed to engage collaborators from the industrial sector and academic institutions, and the White House announced the establishment of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the Natural Sciences Foundation, it currently spends more than $100 million a year on AI research.
Meanwhile, for months now, no measures have been applied in relation to the US legislation that intended to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians hold a referendum to decide whether to change the name of the country
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people held a referendum on changing the name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a measure that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's EU and NATO membership requests.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor constitutes a claim to its territory and has denied it entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has stated that he will not participate in the referendum, and a boycott campaign raises doubts about whether the minimum 50% participation required for the referendum to be valid will be reached.
The question on the referendum paper is: 'Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership, with the agreement with Greece being accepted?'
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price to pay for Macedonia's accession, one of the countries created after the breakup of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, so that young people in Macedonia can live freely under the European Union, because it means that we all will have a safer life", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of MPs have indicated that they will respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
To change the name, a two-thirds majority in Parliament is required.
The State Election Commission reported that no irregularities had occurred at 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% recorded in the last parliamentary elections, held in 2016, in which 66% of registered voters voted.
"I'm here to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, in the capital, Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in the referendum held in Macedonia on the country's name change, which would open the way for accession to the European Union and NATO in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was setting up a small stage and putting chairs in front of the tents installed by people boycotting the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to stick to it with our heads up, not through the back door", Kavadarkov said.
We're a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, like China and Russia, and be part of Eurasian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will be accompanied by more than necessary investments in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I think the vast majority will vote for it, because more than 80% of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", Zaev said before he submitted his paper.
Zaev stated that a "yes" would mean the "confirmation of our future".
In a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, between 30% and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure below the minimum required participation.
According to another poll conducted by the Macedonian TV channel Telma, 57 percent of respondents are expected to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% declared they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
A referendum failure would mark the first hard time for the pro-Western government's policy since it took over in May last year.
Watch the video: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City scores a goal after kicking all of Brighton's defence
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling cancelled Brighton's defence in a 2-0 win over Manchester City in the match played at Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England last Saturday.
Aguero scored a goal in the 65th minute in a play that seemed ridiculously simple.
The Argentine forward received a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the sequence.
He moved by speed between three defenses of Brighton, crushing with what would have been his way through the playing field.
Later, Agüero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He fought one defence before overcoming a few more at the edge of the Brighton area.
Then he took a walk to his left that he found Sterling.
The English forward returned the ball to the first touch, inside the area, to Agüero, who with his right leg beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan, with a shot that slipped inside the net on the right side.
"Agüero has foot problems", City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We decided he'd play between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a goal at that point.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial lead in the Premier League fight.
His goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Aguero received the ball deep on Brighton's field and
He made a lovely pass through space on the left bank towards Leroy Sane.
Sane drove the ball before passing it to Sterling on the long stick.
The Sky Blues forward finished the ball inside the net before coming out of the backline.
City will face Hoffenheim on Tuesday in the Champions League group stage at 18:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, with no options, wants to eliminate the Rockies.
With the Nationals eliminated from playoff contention, there was little reason to force another opening.
But Scherzer, a very competitive player, hopes to get out on the pitch on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, in case the Rockies, who maintain a game-over-the-Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West, have a chance to play the playoffs.
The Rockies secured a comfortable lead with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to get their first division title.
Everything and no play, we can at least get out there and pitch knowing the atmosphere here in Denver, and knowing that the other team will probably be playing every point at the highest level, like no one else has done this year.
Why would I want to lose this game?
The Nationals have yet to announce an opening pitcher for Sunday, but they are apparently determined to let Scherzer pitch if this situation occurs.
Scherzer, which would be its 34th opening, held a warm-up session Thursday and would launch Sunday, on its usual rest day.
The Washington right-hander has an 18-7 record, with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is holding a rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big, big ones -- I don't present myself, but I do, so I'm everywhere fighting for the fantastic candidates", he said.
Trump went on: "You can see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, is happening right now.
They are determined to regain power by all means necessary, their pettyness, their evil intent is evident.
They don't care who does the wrong thing, who they have to go through to get power and control. That's what they want: power and control.
The mission of the Democrats, he said, is to resist and obstruct.
And this can be seen in the last four days, he rebelled, and he called the Democrats "unreasonable, mean, rude and false".
Trump cited Dianne Feinstein, the top-ranking Democratic senator on the Senate Judiciary Committee, a move that sparked a sharp public outcry.
Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Hey, hey, what?
No, uh, no. Wait a minute-- that was a really bad body language expression, the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party has ceased to be a diverse party.
He's intolerant of people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, I wasn't surprised.
After all, I am the last of a series of British MPs who have told us that we are not welcome, all to say what we think.
My fellow parliamentarian Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she spoke out against anti-Semitism.
In my case, with the motion of censure I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically, these are similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders about.
The notice of the Labour Party meeting on Friday in Nottingham stated that we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the General Committee meetings held on Friday night have been exactly like this.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings, and the promise of the most generous and kind policies, if ever, has long been forgotten.
It is increasingly evident that divergent opinions are not tolerated by the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, as colleagues who I previously thought shared a similar political vision expected me to turn 180 degrees and take positions I would never have taken, whether it was on national security or on the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak in public, say what I say, social media is filled with aggressive messages calling for my candidacy not to be renewed, denouncing the policies of the centre and telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just me.
In fact, I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, because the messages I get are usually political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of the colleagues who face a torrent of sexist and racist attacks every day, and they don't succeed.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how the level of abuse has normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn declared last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that diverse party, and with every motion of no confidence or every change in the selection rules, the party became more strained.
Over the last two years, I've received a lot of advice and I've been advised to keep my head down, not be so expressive, and everything would be fine.
But I didn't go into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, as a student, encouraged by Thatcher's negligent government, which literally sank my entire class, I have tried to advocate for better public services for those who need it most, whether as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way doubt my political positions and points of disagreement with the current direction.
To those who voted for the motion on Friday, I would say that at a time when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will hurt our homes, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in reality, the message I want to convey was not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat to not renew my candidacy or any political interest will prevent me from acting, in my opinion, in the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: some undefeated Ayrs take the lead
Two last-minute tries distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayrs deserved the victory in this vibrant Tennent's Premiership day match.
Ayr, the only undefeated team in the top ten, hold the top spot in the standings.
In the end, the local team imposed itself on themselves thanks to their defensive superiority and the fact that they knew how to better seize the opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had reason to be satisfied.
"The games we've played so far have put us to the test and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie, of Melrose, said: "Honour to the Ayrs, they have taken advantage of the opportunities better than we have".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute try, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scottish international Rory Hughes, ceded for the game by the Warriors, allowed the Melrose to take advantage of the numerical superiority and Jason Baggot scored an unconverted try.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty and, just in the half, scored and converted an attempt to put the score 17-5 in favour of Ayr at rest.
But the Melrose got off to a good start in the second half and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted by Baggot, narrowed the gap to five points.
The match was then interrupted for a long time due to the serious injury suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who retired on a leash, and at the resumption the Ayrs again extended the distance with a Stafford McDowall test converted by Climo.
Subsequently, Lieutenant-Colonel Blair Macpherson was warned with a yellow card and, again, the Melrose took advantage of the superiority of one more man with an unconverted essay by Bruce Colvine at the end of a few moments of heavy pressure.
However, the local team reacted and when Struan Hutchinson saw a yellow card to make a playoff appearance at Climo without a ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson scored a counter-offence behind the Ayrs' penetrating moul.
Climo scored, as he had done almost since the draw, after Kyle Rowe collected a shot from David Armstrong and passed the ball to third-line winger Gregor Henry to score the fifth try for the local team.
The star of the series Still Game seems to be about to embark on a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears set to move into the hospitality industry after it was discovered he has been named director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the character of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and co-stars with Greg Hemphill, his longtime comedic partner.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the series' final, and it appears Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, although a source in The Scottish Sun newspaper pointed out that Kiernan intended to enter the thriving Glasgow restaurant sector.
Bolivia, without coastline, hopes the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
The sailors patrol their ship covered in ash at La Paz.
Public buildings hoist a sea blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are emblazoned with the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
To recover it is a duty.
Across the landlocked territory of Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century remains very vivid, as is the desire to sail back through the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the deepest in decades, as Bolivia awaits the resolution of the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the drive, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, needless to say, it expects the outcome with a positive attitude", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the TIJ resolution on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague Court will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile is forced to negotiate the granting of a sovereign exit to the sea for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who faces a contentious battle for re-election next year, also has many hopes set in Monday's resolution.
"We're very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean", he promised last August.
However, some analysts believe that the Court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia and that if it did, things would not change much.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The TIJ's resolution, which comes just six months after the final allegations were filed, indicates that the case was not complicated, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean specialist in international law.
And far from being favored, the Bolivian cause may have experienced a setback in the last four years.
The current Bolivian administration has seized the issue of access to the sea, Zárate noted.
The belligerent rhetoric of Morales has undermined any gesture of goodwill on the part of Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be very difficult to keep conversations going after this episode.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representing Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the decision-making of the Court was exceptionally quick.
Next Monday Bolivia will have an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and an opportunity to end 139 years of discrepancies, with mutual benefits, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of Latin America's most popular presidents, was using the maritime issue as a political cross.
"Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific Ocean", he added.
The resolution is an opportunity to realize that we have to move beyond the past.
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen unless it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will not eliminate nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke last Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
The minister urged the United States to keep its promises made during a summit held in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His remarks come at a time when it appears that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is about to resume stalled nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the summit held in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a sham to think that continued sanctions and U.S. objection to a declaration ending the Korean War could make North Korea never kneel down.
Washington is reluctant to accept the statement unless Pyongyang makes major disarmament moves first.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is taking seriously the issue of giving up an arsenal that the country considers the only means to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest range of large-scale bars, en route to a major street near you
If you want to increase the size of your collection of bars or to protect yourself completely from the sun, you don't have to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented at the runway a range of extravagant bars of disproportionate size from their SS19 collection, which dazzled the style defined at the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram has been hit by very impractical barriers, and these designers have brought their amazing creations to the aisle.
Valentino's highlight was an exaggerated beer barrel, adorned with a broad, lead-shaped wing, which flooded the models' heads.
Among other oversized accessories, there were nailed shingles, a witch barrel and even a pinya, but these are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of extra-folk masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the masks, brightly colored, had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high-heeled.
One creature looked like a full-scale scuba diving team, with tubes and glasses, while another looked like a hollow ice cone.
And if you follow the big trends in fashion, you're in luck.
Style observers predict that huge barricades could be implanted on the main streets near you.
The large-sized bars pierce the heels of la Bomba, a ball bar with a wide two-foot wing, which everyone has carried, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult tag behind the barrel that spread through social media brought another great creation to the walkway: a beach ball bag, almost as big as the model dressed in a swimsuit that carried it.
The black orange raffle bag, adorned with raffle locks and finished with a white leather pendant, was the highlight of Jacquemus's La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I hope to see people wearing large barrels and beach bags on the main streets next summer.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a track record of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, which is reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible service to pupils and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, for the career they choose and for their place as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a personalized curriculum, we note that modern languages remain a popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, you'll get to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart.
This is a very important reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of last year's exams, we can see that languages lead the rankings with the highest grades in independent schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages got the top A grade.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools reflected that 72% of students obtained an A-level above in Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students also obtained an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, languages, as a subject of choice, are kept in the same consideration as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects in the plans of study from independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission revealed that 17% of the reasons employers gave for the difficulty of filling vacancies was due to a lack of language skills.
Language skills are therefore increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
As there are more and more potential job opportunities that require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with a permanent competition like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the UK, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to keep a conversation going, and French, with 15% of speakers, was the only language with a double-digit percentage.
For this reason, investing in language learning is important for today's children.
Knowing different languages, especially those of developed economies, will give children better opportunities to find important jobs.
In Scotland, there is diversity among schools in the languages taught.
Some schools focus more on more traditional modern languages, while others teach languages that are thought to be more important for the UK in the future, around 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, they can always choose from a range of languages at independent schools, which have specialist teaching staff.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
In today's global business environment, there is no denying that languages continue to be vital to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered as international communication skills.
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
You have to do it right.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron is making his debut with the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play his first preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But the minutes he's playing are yet to be determined.
"They'll be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Mike Trudell, a Lakers reporter, tweeted that James will probably play a few minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need preseason games at this stage of my career to be on point", he rebelled.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a campaign wave tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five Trump meetings scheduled for next week, which include visits to friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote for his Supreme Court nominee is pending, Trump is seeking support for the next midterm election, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump's meeting in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's meeting in West Virginia can be viewed online at the link below, via live video streaming via YouTube.
Trump is likely to address the hearing that began this week with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who was strained over the sexual abuse allegations he faces, while the Senate's expected confirmation vote is pending for up to a week and the FBI is investigating the case.
But the main goal of this wave of rallies is to help the Republicans running in the delicate November election gain momentum.
So, the five presidential campaign meetings scheduled for next week are aimed at encouraging volunteers and supporters, while the Republicans try to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House, according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as he can, as we head toward a busy campaign season", a Trump spokesman who declined to be identified said, according to Reuters.
Tonight's rally, scheduled at Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, could bring together sympathizers from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract media coverage from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who is getting unfavorable results in the polls.
"It's not a good signal for Morrisey that the president should come and give him a boost in the polls", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows their ambition to keep their hopes alive ahead of Sunday's individual games
After three unequal sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes were probably what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of dynamics is a sporting concept invented, in which players really believe, especially in competitions like this one.
So which side is the positive dynamic now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so I think we're on a little positive lap", Jordan Spieth said as he walked away at the end of the day.
Obviously, Europe has an advantage, four points ahead, with 12 more at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel the wind is blowing a little bit in their favor and have plenty of reason to be excited, largely because of the state of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points out of four.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and is setting an example.
The celebration guttural cries increased in intensity as he continued his lap and a crucial putt to tie the fourth game came as he and Thomas had been two down after two holes.
He celebrated the putt that won the game at hole 15 with a similar scream, the kind that indicates he believes the American team is not yet out of the competition.
"You have to do your best and worry about your own game", Spieth pointed out.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup sensation.
The strange but adorable European couple carry four out of four and make no mistakes.
Moliwood were the only couple who did not make a bogey Saturday afternoon, and also avoided the bogey Saturday morning and Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes Friday morning.
Because of this result and the way their energy seems to flow to and from the buzzing crowd, it is reaffirmed that they are the players to beat Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to close a possible European victory as the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, talking about European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly ended up with Sergio Garcia, the morning fourball hero, who paired up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes plunged the Spanish and Swedish into a hole from which they never had any choice to get out.
On Sunday, though, there's no one who can help you out of the hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are very fascinating to see for the interactions between the devices, the advice they give and the advice they don't, and the way a strategy can change over and over again.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and will face the final day with a significant advantage, but this foursome session has shown that the US team has the motivation to fight that some, especially in the US, have questioned.
Europe reaches the Ryder Cup final with a favourable score of 10-6
Europe will face the final day of the Ryder Cup with a comfortable lead after finishing the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday with a 10-6 victory over the United States.
The inspirational duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made a great effort to achieve two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods and set their record, so far, at four points at Le Golf National.
The European team, captained by Thomas Bjorn, who aspired to retain the trophy he lost two years ago at Hazeltine, defeated an unsuccessful American team in the morning fourballs and put the series at 3-1.
The U.S. put up more resistance to the foursomes and won two games, but they were unable to reduce the differences.
Jim Furyk's team needed to score eight points in 12 individual games on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, known by the nickname of Molliwood after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to score four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After knocking Woods and Patrick Reed out of the four-balls, they scored a brilliant performance to beat a de-inflated Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau for an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who had dragged on in two games on Saturday, showed sporadic spurs of genius, but has lost 19 of 29 games in fourballs and foursomes, and seven consecutive.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning fourballs, re-matched Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and fell 2-1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, ranked first and third in the world, respectively.
However, Europe was not in the mood for a nice, windy day southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, three-time tournament champion, and Justin Thomas set a benchmark for the Americans on Saturday by scoring two points.
They achieved a decisive 2-1 victory over Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and, later, they again beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes, having lost the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history had a team recorded a four-point gap in individual matches, although Furyk's title-winning team only needed to tie to retain it.
However, after being the second best for two days, it seems that a counterattack on Sunday is out of reach.
North Korea declares that it will not unilaterally disarm in any way unless signs of confidence are appreciated
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were increasing its distrust of the United States and that under such circumstances the country would not unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons in any way.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important goodwill measures" during the previous year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear testing center and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we're not seeing any response in consensus from the US", he said.
Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under these circumstances, we will not unilaterally begin disarmament in any way.
While Ri echoed North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a phased denuclearization approach that North Korea would reward as it took steps gradually, his statements seemed significant in that he did not reject unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to work on the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump pledged guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has attempted to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has communicated that Pyongyang must first eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted the call to ease the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
The US insists that denuclearization must first take place and increase the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal coercively, in addition to opposing the declaration of the end of the war, Ri noted.
The perception that sanctions will make us kneel down is a chimera of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions are intensifying our distrust.
Ri did not refer to the plans to hold a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: If the party involved in the denuclearization issue were South Korea instead of the US, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached this stalemate.
However, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from last year's when he declared to the UN General Assembly that targeting US territory with North Korean missiles was inevitable after President Evil Trump dubbed Kim "Rocket Man" in a suicide mission.
Trump, who last year threatened to completely destroy North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said there was still much to be done and sanctions would remain until North Korea denuclearized.
Last Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for that and that it didn't matter if it took two years, three years, or five months.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared Thursday at the UN Security Council that: "The application of sanctions by the Security Council must continue vigorously and without exception until we confirm total and definitive denuclearization".
The Security Council has pushed for sanctions on North Korea unanimously since 2006 in a bid to cut funding for Pyongyang's ballistic missile and nuclear programs.
Pompeo met Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then announced that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go very well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but within hours North Korea accused him of making "gangster's own demands".
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile center and a nuclear complex if the United States took "measures in consistency".
He said Kim had communicated to him that the "consonant measures" he was seeking were the security measures Trump had promised Singapore, in addition to actions to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a class on rest habits
Last year, a new course at Harvard University allowed its students to sleep more, in an effort to combat the increasingly widespread culture of studying all night, stimulated by caffeine.
One academic observed that students at the number one university in the world are often distracted by the basic aspects of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
She was inspired to create the course after giving a talk about the impact sleep deprivation had on learning.
And at the end of the conversation, a young girl came up to me and said, "Why are you telling me all this now, in my last year?"
He said that no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first implemented this year, explains the basic concepts of how good sleep habits improve academic and sporting performance, as well as overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's health services, stated that the University decided to introduce the course after learning that some students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a bedroom, where students have to click on cups of coffee, curtains, blankets and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light, about how sports performance affects sleep deprivation, and about the importance of maintaining a sleep routine.
In another section, participants are briefed on how long-term sleep deprivation can increase their risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Below is a campus map with interactive icons encouraging participants to think about their daily route.
We know that students' behavior will not change immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know, as one has a right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes", said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in staying up all night, he said, still exists, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure students face are making sleep deprivation an increasing problem.
Ensuring you enjoy good quality sleep for long enough should be a secret weapon for students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he added, even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in a state of inactivity and makes students always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies Chemistry and Physical Biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after attending one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
Raymond commented that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote the course throughout the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask graduate students to undertake a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students keep in mind the fact that they should set an alarm when they go to sleep and when they wake up, and that they should be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can alter the harmony of the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal ends with Gerrard's men
Dolly Menga's goal condemns Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston's home which means another knockout away.
Ibrox's side were looking to add their first home win since last February's 4-1 victory at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side inflicted the second defeat on Gerrard in 18 games as coach to leave their side at a disadvantage, to 8 points from the Hearts, the undefeated leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes before halftime, and it never looked like the Rangers, lacking inspiration, were about to match the score.
While Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston rise to third, behind Hibernian by goal difference.
And the Rangers could face further difficulties afterwards, as line judge Calum Spence needed medical attention for a head injury caused by an object that apparently jumped from the barn.
Gerrard made eight changes to the line-up that ruined the Ayrs in the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, came off the bench with the same 11 points he scored against the Hearts last week, and he was certainly satisfied with the way his well-organized team was stifling their rivals at all times.
Although the Rangers dominated the possession, Livingston created more danger when they had the ball.
In fact, they should have scored in the two minutes of the game, when Menga's first intervention left Scott Pittman alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder played away and took advantage of the great opportunity.
A blunt foul throw from Keaghan Jacobs came across Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive teammate Alan Lithgow only made a detoured shot to the rear pole.
The Rangers were in control, but they seemed to have more hope than faith in their game in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos really believed he should have had a penalty at the 15 minute mark, as he and Steven Lawless met, but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers only managed two goals in the first half, but the first goalkeeper for the Ibrox, Liam Kelly, had no problem with Lassana Coulibaly's head-stroke and front-footer Ovie Ejaria.
While the Livi's first act in the 34th minute may have been against the race, no one can deny that they deserved it just for their effort.
Again, the Rangers couldn't fight Jacobs' hard work.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm to pick Menga for a simple final.
Gerrard acted at the break in changing Coulibaly to Ryan Kent. The change had an almost immediate impact, as the extreme made a pass to Morelos, although imposing Kelly ran into the block.
However, the Livingstons continued to capture visitors' attention playing exactly as they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett making long passes, one after the other.
Holt's band could have given way to the final stages, but McGregor remained steadfast in rejecting Jacobs before Lithgow made a deviated shot from the corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton still asked for a penalty kick for a dispute with Jacobs, but again Thomson made the big eyes.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page of the Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, counting down the day the physicist of the future, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually gave rise to the device we know as the Geiger computer.
The Geiger counter, which has been a pillar of science ever since, also became a staple of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, apparently unsuccessful cowboy physicists:
Man: "What kind of tooth is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms emitting radioactivity on minerals".
Evans: "It's definitely going to explode now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to kill malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to live and kill malignant cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of the treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them in the lab.
You can see a protein common to many cancers and then you can inject them again.
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
One woman who received the vaccine, which teaches her immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear after more than 18 months of suffering.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in the lab to "see" a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2) and then re-injecting them.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, U.S.A.: "The results we have come up with suggest that we have a promising vaccine".
The HER2 protein favours the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal, Professor Berzofsky has explained.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and teaching these cells how to treat cancer cells has worked in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West was embroiled in a pro-Trump diatribe with a MAGA hat after his performance on SNL.
It didn't end well.
Kanye West was cast in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a chaotic performance in which he congratulated US President Donald Trump and said he would run for the 2020 election.
After his third song of the night, titled Ghost Town, in which he wore a Make America Great Again cap, he began to criticize Democrats and reiterate his support for Trump.
"Every time I talk to white people, they say, 'How can you like Trump if he's racist?
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago", she said.
The SNL show began with a parody of Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee over sexual assault allegations brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not aired, comedian Chris Rock uploaded West's recording of his disapproval to social media.
It is unclear whether Rock intended to ridicule West with the publication.
However, West has complained to the public that he was not treated well behind the scenes because of his hat.
"I was threatened behind the scenes.
I was told not to go out with that hat on.
I was besieged.
And then they say I'm in a lower position", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the bottom position?" as he said he would put on Superman's coat because they couldn't tell him what to do.
Try to love".
His comments provoked public scrutiny at least twice and the members of the program's team seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, which had a reporter explain to the publication: "The entire study was completely silent".
West was acting as a last-minute replacement for Ariana Grande, whose ex, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West left much of the audience perplexed with the performance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West gained the support of TPUSA's conservative group leader, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: GRACE FOR STARTING IN THE MULTITY".
But the talk show host, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was simply "being who he is and that he is absolutely wonderful".
"But I have chosen not to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their 'art') who I believe adopts and spreads an ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
And so are we", he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and was now "the former Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, was formerly called Snoop Lion and the now-defunct music legend Prince was renamed a symbol and, later, the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder by stabbing at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed on Friday in east Belfast.
According to the police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast High Court on Monday.
The DA will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has revealed a toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for playing the role of Swordsman Jon Snow in the HBO violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has denounced the stereotype of a male hero, saying that these roles imply that young boys often believe they must be strong to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times' Culture magazine, Kit said he believed that something had gone wrong and that he questioned how to address the issue of toxic masculinity outside of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married the co-star of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, has admitted that she is strongly determined to tackle this issue.
"Personally, I wonder now where we went wrong about masculinity", he says.
What have we taught men during their development in relation to the problem we are experiencing now?
According to Kit, television can be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity thanks to its so masculine characters.
He added: "What is innate and what is acquired?
What is the meaning of television and the streets that make young boys feel they must have this facet of manhood?
I think it's one of the big questions of our time: How do we change it?
Because there's definitely something wrong with the young boys.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not do any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the series finale is scheduled for next summer, all saying he is tired of battles and horses.
Starting in November, Kit will star in a reboot of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his partner Rose is the best Game of Thrones has provided him.
"I met my wife on the show, so she gave me my future family and my life ahead", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at the family estate of Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health officials.
Only in the second quarter of 2018 were 40,000 new cases reported.
The vast majority of new cases are sexually transmitted, unlike the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some regions of China due to infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV from this cause has been reduced to almost zero, according to statements by Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is common.
Given the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that between 70 and 90 percent of men who have homosexual relations will end up marrying a woman.
Many of the diseases transmitted are due to a lack of proper precautions in sexual intercourse.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee leaked data from Republican Party senators and dismantles dangerous lies and conspiracy theories.
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denounced on Saturday allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information from three U.S. Republican senators on the legislators' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed the demands were driven by critics and far-right websites.
"Lies, lies and more despicable lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information allegedly contained the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information went online Thursday and was posted by an unknown person on the Capitol during a session of the Senate committee on sexual abuse allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was related to the Waters office and that it revealed information from a Waters staff member, the Capitol denounced.
"This groundless complaint is completely false and a pure lie", Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised by these false and fraudulent allegations, was not responsible in any way for this information leak.
This groundless complaint is completely false and a pure invention".
Waters' statement quickly generated online criticism, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is full of indignation", wrote Fleischer.
"That makes you think he doesn't have the temperament to be a congressman.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, do not be angry.
You don't have to be defiant.
You must not question the prosecutor's motives.
You must maintain calmness and serenity".
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, who critics accused of looking too angry during Thursday's session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to overthrow Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"It doesn't matter if it's true", he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted the relevant authorities and security forces of these fraudulent statements.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed", he continued, "and that they are held legally responsible for all actions they have taken and harmed each and every member of my staff".
Criticism of Johnny English Strikes Again: a limited spy parody by Rowan Atkinson
It's already a tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new film with a British focus, and this re-imagining of the Johnny English action-comedy parody franchise, which was born in 2003 with Johnny English and re-emerged in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, is no exception.
Is this humorous self-portrait about how despicable we are gonna be another export opportunity for the country?
In any case, the incompetent out-of-the-box and rubber-faced Johnny English has been able to renew his license for a second time to twist it all.
Obviously, he's the stupid secret agent who, despite his rare claims of liquid glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a Mr. Bean dot and a touch of this guy who brings a single note to the theme of Fire Cars at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
Originally, it was based on the mysterious international traveler Atkinson who represented the now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercials, where he was sowing chaos everywhere.
There's a good time or two on this last trip of JE's.
He loved the Johnny English who approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the leaves of the helmet were sticking to his helmet.
I see Atkinson's gift for physical comedy, but humor seems pretty fluid and oddly superfluous, especially because "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now already include comedy as an ingredient.
Humor seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and, to me, Johnny English's absurd adventures are not as ingenious or focused as the mute gags of the character Mr. Bean portrayed by Atkinson.
The recurringly topical premise now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated the British top-secret web spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents on the ground, causing the dismay of the service agent, a role unfortunately small for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last resort for a prime minister who's a pretentious and besieged figure, who's already suffering a total collapse of lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this shrill character of Teresa-May, but the script doesn't get any further.
His intelligence advisers inform him that, as each active spy is put in danger, he will have to recover some from retirement.
And that includes the son of a bitch Johnny English, now employed as a professor at some luxury institution, but teaching off-the-job classes on how to become a covert agent, with some good gags, like when English offers a spy academy that looks like a rock school.
English is quickly returned to Whitehall for an emergency meeting with his patient Bough, a role he returns to play for Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, tied to the commander of a submarine, an enthusiastic role, in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit underappreciated.
So, Batman and Robin of when things get really ugly to His Majesty's secret service come into action once again and find Olga Kurylenko the spectacular femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the spell of the charismatic technological billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, portrayed by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous madness: dressed as chamberlains, set fire to a French fast food restaurant, sow chaos by smuggling on board the luxury yacht of Volta and English causes a great confusion in trying to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize themselves with the interior of Volta's house.
All the stops have been extracted from this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and noise it presents, everything together seems like a children's show.
Pretty normal things.
As with Johnny English's other films, it has not helped to think whether the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is devising a plan for the British to have a four-day work week and cover five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will have to consider a radical plan whereby the British will work four days a week and charge five.
Supposedly, the party wants the heads of the companies to pass the savings made by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution on to the workers by giving them one more day of celebration.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but they would get the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea would fit with the party's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country in favor of workers.
The shift to a four-day workweek is supported by the trade union Confederation Trades Union Congress as a method for workers to benefit from economic change.
An experienced Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It will not be overnight, but a four-day work week is an aspiration that fits the party's perspective of balancing the economy in favour of the worker and the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day work week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not support this aspiration jointly at present.
According to a Labour Party spokesman: "A four-day work week is not party politics and the party is not considering it.
Shadow minister John McDonnell used last week's party conference to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell expressed his determination to restore the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" to public service companies.
The shadow minister's plans also imply that water company shareholders may not recover all investment, as the Labour government could apply "deductions" for the offences it perceives.
It also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and create inclusive ownership funds to deliver 10% of private sector firm shares to employees, who expect to raise annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy explains to 60 Minutes if the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation could change their minds.
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising the question of whether the agency's findings could influence any Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview that will be published Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring something to light that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I'm serious", Kennedy said.
"At the hearing I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it all happened and the charges were made public, and I asked him if he had.
He was firm, determined, and confident".
But Graham's vote seems engraved on fire.
"I have my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and would make an explosive accusation", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett flatly denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people I name can verify it.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see anything changing again".
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Has it done anything to reduce poverty?
New York will host this Saturday the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event, which features an absolutely impressive star-studded program, which carry out an equally impressive mission: eradicate poverty in the world.
In its seventh edition this year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people gather in the Great Lawn area of Central Park not only to enjoy performances like those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the global goal of the event to end extreme poverty in the world by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively help fight it.
To receive a free admission to the event (except for someone willing to pay a VIP admission), attendees had to do a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other activity to raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
What has Global Citizen achieved now that it has 12 years to go?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a good way to persuade them to demand a call to action or simply another case of what we call "clictivism" (people who think it makes a difference to sign an online petition or tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters, which have helped achieve several goals.
He states that these actions have helped spur global leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to over USD 37 billion, which will have impacted the lives of over 2.250 million people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements derived from its shares, of which at least USD 10 billion has already been paid or raised.
The group estimates that the protected funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition Foundation, a UK-based association of investors and developers, which is committed to "helping children grow as much as possible" and promises to send Rwanda $35 million to help fight malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 Global Citizens tweets.
"Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens members like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote in history", The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also explained that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the P+Fs on their website asking "what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded, "It's going to be a long, hard road.
But like the great civil rights movements and the anti-apartheid movements before that, we will triumph, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the performers at this year's event in New York City, which will feature Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a "block" to impede Russian energy exports.
Washington can, "if necessary", resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting markets, including those in the Middle East, US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke has denounced Russia's intervention in Syria, mainly where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government, as a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is their willingness to negotiate with energy, as they already do in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe", he said, presumably.
According to the official, there are ways and means to address this issue.
"The United States has the capacity, along with the Navy, to ensure that sea lanes are open and, if necessary, to blockade, to prevent its energy from entering the market", he said.
Zinke was addressing attendees at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that defines itself as the "energy consumer's will" in the US.
He compared Washington's strategies for negotiating with Russia and Iran, and pointed out that they are actually the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels", he said, while pointing out that Russia has only one resource, since its economy depends on fossil fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration has been on a mission to boost its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, the most economical option for European consumers.
To this end, officials of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, try to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which Trump says turned Berlin into a "captive" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which has cost 11 billion USD and will double the existing capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers, Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US stance has provoked a negative response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, FDI (Federation of German Industries), has called on the US to withdraw from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has stated that she will consider holding her candidacy for president in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would consider holding her presidential nomination after the midterm elections.
During a city council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix the government breakdown, for women to hold high office", The Hill reported.
After November 6, I will take my candidacy for president seriously.
Warren spoke about President Donald Trump during the city council meeting and stated that he was "leading the country in the wrong direction".
"I'm frankly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday, Warren said, "It's clear that an FBI investigation is needed before the election".
However, a poll published Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters believed he would not be running for office by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters have said the senator would not run, according to a survey by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The poll revealed wider support for former governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent in favor of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile names among Democrats who were considered in relation to a possible 2020 candidacy include Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially reveal his decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes the TEPT affected Track Palin at the Donald Trump rally
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after enlisting on 11 September 2007
Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son has been going through since he came back, I can understand other families suffering from the ramifications of PTSD and some of the emotional wounds that our soldiers are returning with", he told the audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said the following about his son and other war veterans: "They come back a little different, they come back hardened, they come back wondering if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, as well as any other member of the military, have given to the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, with a statement of domestic violence and possession of alcohol-related weapons, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eight states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge to a new US policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence
Representatives from 18 states and the district filed an amicus curiae brief Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who defied the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the lawsuit in Grace v. Sessions that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and the children of the gang member" assaulted her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers from the states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where large numbers of asylum seekers are generated in the U.S., as countries facing widespread gang and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to seek asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine declared Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation".
Federal laws require that asylum claims be awarded according to the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and this prohibition violates this principle, according to the amicus curiae.
Lawyers also argued in the report that policies that deny immigrant entry hurt the U.S. economy, as they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide needed jobs".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant more asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear for reasons of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of the policy.
Asylum has never sought to alleviate all the problems, even the most serious, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as human losses multiply in a rush to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is becoming increasingly desperate.
"The atmosphere is very tense", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she calmed her fever-stricken son in an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute, an ambulance carries bodies.
There is a lack of clean water".
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes to take in flooded belongings and try to save what they can.
There are hundreds of injured, and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude quake, are overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who has fractured his shoulder, are outside the Palu military hospital as patients are being treated outside due to the repeated heavy shaking.
Tears filled his eyes as he explained how the violent earthquake shook the fifth-floor room of the hotel where he was with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save us.
He was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think", Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had attended a wedding in the village.
I heard my wife crying for help and then I couldn't hear her anymore.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope you're all right".
The US ambassador accuses China of being annoyed with "propaganda announcements".
A week after an official Chinese publication published a four-page ad in an American newspaper promoting the mutual advantages of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China has accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump addressed China Daily's payroll supplement to The Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, on Wednesday after accusing China of meddling in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, an accusation China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in the US election marked what US officials have explained to Reuters as a new phase of Washington's campaign to step up pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war that has seen tariffs on mutual imports soar.
China's vengeful tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were aimed at punishing state exporters, such as Iowa, who supported Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and longtime former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, claimed that Beijing had harmed US workers, farmers and businesses.
In an op-ed in The Des Moines Register of The Sunday, Branstad wrote: "It is doubling down on the publicity with the publication of propaganda ads in our free press".
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the cherished American tradition of free speech and free press to insert a paid advertisement in The Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the kiosk down the street here in Beijing, you will find few dissenting voices and you will see no real reflection of the disparate views that Chinese citizens may have about China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is dominated by the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that "one of China's leading newspapers was evading the offer to publish" his article, but did not say the name of the publication.
Republicans are splitting up female voters before midterm elections with the Kavanaugh disaster, analysts warn
As many of the top Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who faces multiple sexual assault lawsuits, analysts have warned they will see a negative response, especially among women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The excitement surrounding this case is extremely high and most Republicans are already officially showing that they want to step up with a vote.
These things can't be undone", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that the last-minute pressures by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to conduct an FBI investigation are enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, tomorrow or November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as they demonstrated in the Senate lobby as Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee decided to continue Kavanaugh's nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, according to the Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be off the charts", explained Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst at the news site.
"People say they've been high; it's true.
But it could have been more so, especially among suburban female voters and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who often don't vote when they don't like the president".
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which he detailed his sexual assault claims against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that a negative response could be produced if Republicans pressed for confirmation.
"This has become an embolism for the GOP", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the board vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh sits on the bench, but it's also about how Republicans have handled this issue and how they've treated it", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be divided between those who believe in the Ford Star and Kavanaugh's witnesses, with the balance shifting slightly toward the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents believe unquestionably or likely in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say they believe unquestionably or likely in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh had probably or unquestionably lied during his testimony, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the claims made by Ford and, at least, another whistleblower, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted her under the influence of alcohol when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed him his genitals at a party while they were studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web, is launching a new company that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's Solid open source platform.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people can access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's hidden intent was to "dominate the world".
"We have to do it now", he said of the emerging company.
"This is a historic moment".
The application uses the technology of the Solid platform to allow users to create their own "personal online data warehouse" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify. They're all available in one browser at a time.
What is exclusive to the personal online data warehouse is that the user decides who can access certain information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
The idea behind Inrupt, according to the company's chief executive, John Bruce, is that the company integrates resources, processes and skills that are appropriate to make the Solid platform available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some template developers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that none of his team is talking to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a radical change where all business models are completely emptied overnight.
"We're not asking for permission from them".
In a Saturday post to Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that the mission of Inrupt is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web integrated into the Solid platform".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Clergyman of the Cross Celebration of the First GM Victory
The only Church of England clergyman to win a Victory Cross during World War I as a combatant has been honoured in his home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the medal on 29 September 1918 for his actions at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was shot down by a sniper four days later and never knew he had earned the most important British military honour.
Her two grandchildren unveiled a commemorative plaque at a parade on Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" that the tombstone was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning feat.
According to The London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog and under intense fire of cannons and machine guns".
He later ran to the line of fire and, with "maximum valentia" advanced the line before jumping on a cannon with one hand and leaving three members of the detachment stunned.
Lieutenant Colonel was shot down by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather's actions were a process he could never match, which produces a sense of humility.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to be part of the parade and added that the courage of a true hero is shown by the support he will receive from many people.
The MMA fans who stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 saw Peppa Pig instead
Imagine you're up all night watching Bellator 206 and you're denied the most important event.
The San Jose poster contained 13 fights, including six from the main card and were to be seen live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the match, UK viewers were stunned when the programming changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were upset that they had stayed up all night watching the fight.
A Twitter follower described the change to cartoons as "a kind of vomiting accusation".
"Government regulations say that at 6:00 this content is not appropriate, so they switched to children's programming", said Dave Schwartz, vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the rebroadcast.
"Pep the pig, yeah".
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said they would work on the programming to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about repetition, I think it can work", Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock on a Sunday morning and we can't solve it until Sunday at our time, Monday at your time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when I switched channels, there were a lot of messages coming and going, and not all of them were nice.
We were trying to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't. It was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We're gonna put it in five games instead of six as usual, and we tried to put it back in the fans, but it was over.
It's an unfortunate situation".
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior about sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to the rest of the people because of his sexuality, but that this provided him with the motivation to triumph.
The 24-year-old athlete has stated that he didn't realize until he went to high school that not everyone was like him.
On Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, she said she was talking about gay rights to give hope to other people.
He also said that being a father had left him with little importance in winning the Olympics.
The long-running show's regular host, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Daley, who appeared as a shipwreck on Laverne's first show, said she felt "less than" the others because "she was not socially acceptable as boys and girls".
He said, "Today, those feelings of inferiority and difference, have been real things that have given me the power and the strength to triumph".
He wanted to prove that it was "something", he said, so as not to disappoint anyone when they finally discovered their sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile promoter of the LGBT movement and has used his image at last year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he had spoken because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and that he wanted to give hope to other people.
The world record holder explained that she had fallen in love with a man, the American filmmaker, Dustin Lance Black, who met her in 2013, "taken me by surprise".
Last year, Daley married the Oscar winner, 20 years older than him, but he says the age difference has never been an issue.
According to him, when you go through that when you're young (he participated in his first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone of his age who has experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June of a child named Robert Ray Black-Daley, who Daley said "his whole outlook" has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, all I needed was to win an Olympic gold", he said.
"There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 from brain cancer.
According to Daley, her father did not accept that she had to die and one of the last things she asked was if they already had tickets to London 2012 because she wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, Dad, you're not going to be there to take the front row", he said.
"As I grabbed his hand, he stopped breathing and it wasn't until then, that he was already dead, that I finally accepted that he wasn't invincible", she said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life: jumping in front of a crowd at home in an Olympic Games.
She also inspired the selection of her first song (Proud by Heather Small), which she had heard during the Olympics preparation and which still put her chicken skin on.
Desert Island Discs aired on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
A miserable Mickelson showed up at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will break a record on Sunday in his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to change his physical condition if he doesn't want to become an unhappy fixture.
Mickelson, who will participate in the biennial event to break a record 12 times, was introduced by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes modalities.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as has been the custom for the United States, the winner of five major tournaments splits his time between cheering and working on his game on the field, hoping to rectify what hurts him.
He has never made the most direct drivers, not even at the peak of his career, but the 48-year-old is not the ideal option for Le Golf National's difficult trajectory, where the long rough tends to punish the deflected shots.
And if his own trajectory isn't discouraging enough, Mickelson, in Game 9 on Sunday, will face the pre-eminent British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who has joined rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, four points down at the start of the 12 individual games, start strong, Mickelson's game could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, and could not say much more.
"He understood his role for the day perfectly, he slapped me in the back and he held my arm around me as he told me he would be ready for tomorrow", Furyk said.
"He has a lot of self-confidence.
It's a hall of fame and it's contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's how I trained and that's how we thought we were going to get ahead.
He wants to be there, like anyone else".
On Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played.
It can mean the end of a Ryder Cup race that has not matched his individual record.
Mickelson has scored 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has brought intangibles to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, joking, likes to make fun of people and is a great team mate", he explained.
I think the younger players also enjoyed staying with him this week, which was fun to watch.
It brings a lot more to his game.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows the advantage can soon vanish
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that starting with a considerable advantage individual duels on the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a tough day.
The Danish made his debut in 1997 at Valderrama, when the team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the American team, but in the end they won by a margin of 14.5-13.5.
You keep reminding us that we had a big advantage at Valderrama; we had a big advantage at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but for a short time, Bjorn has stated, in the image, after seeing the team's 2018 win by 5-3 both Friday and yesterday, which leaves the score at 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History has taught me and all the members of the team that it's not over yet.
We have to go to the whole machine tomorrow.
You have to go out and do it right.
This isn't over until the points are on the scoreboard.
We have a goal, trying to win the trophy, and we have to stay focused to do that.
I've already said that, I'm focusing on the 12 players we have on the team, but I also have our rivals present: the best players in the world.
Enchanted by his players' performance on a demanding golf course, Bjorn added: "I will never rush into this.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow, individual performance will make a difference and change everything.
It's great to be there with a partner when everything's fine, but individual duels test your golfing ability to the fullest.
That's the message you have to convey to the players, bring out the best in yourself tomorrow.
Right now, you leave your partner and he has to go out and get the best of himself, too.
In contrast to Bjorn, rival captain Jim Furyk expects his players to perform better individually than as a team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk knows both sides of the coin over the last day's rallies, as he was part of the winning team at Brookline before ending up losing in the Medinah Miracle that won Europe.
"I remember all the words exactly", he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, motivated his players before the final day.
Tomorrow we have 12 big games, but we want to start on a good foot, as we saw in Brookline and Medina.
When there's a team that's inspired, there's a lot of pressure in these central duels.
We've prepared the alignment according to the circumstances and the best way to try magic tomorrow.
Thomas is challenged to try to start the rematch against Rory McIlroy in the main duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the rest of the Europeans in the first half of the order.
"I chose this order because I think it covers all possibilities", says Bjorn about his selection for individual matches.
The new German warship, postponed again
The new German Navy frigate should have been completed in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era warships, but it won't do so until at least next year due to faulty systems and an increase in cost, according to local media.
The completion of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the lead ship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but problems following construction have marked the end of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships commissioned by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is believed to include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-buck missiles, as well as technology against stealth actions, such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other notable features include longer maintenance periods: it should be possible to use the new frigates for up to two years without passing through national ports.
However, these continued delays imply that the forward ships, which were expected to be able to project into Germany as a powerful force abroad, will already be obsolete when they enter service, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate was already in the news last year, when the German Navy rejected the ship and returned it to the drassan Blohm & Voss of Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a builder once delivered.
Little is known about the reasons for her return, but German media have cited several "material and technical" defects in the ship that made it useless if used in combat missions.
The technical problems are important, as about 120 sailors, half the crew needed for the former Bremen-class frigates, operate on Baden-Württemberg-class ships.
In addition, the ship's weight has also been known to be excessive, reducing its performance and limiting the Navy's ability to add future improvements.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz will weigh twice as much as similar class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Aside from the defective materials, the cost of the project, which includes crew training, is also starting to pose a problem.
It is believed to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) from an initial budget of 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of the new frigates have become a matter of particular importance, if one takes into account recent warnings that indicate that Germany's maritime military power is weakening.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence committee, has acknowledged that the Navy is running out of ships to use.
The official has claimed that the situation has worsened over time as the old ships were discontinued, but no new ones were provided as a replacement.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Foundation spies on the secret life of the ratpenates
A new study at a farm in the Scottish Highlands seeks to discover how rats use the landscape to feed.
It is hoped that the discoveries could provide new data on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help in future conservation activities.
The study of scientists at the National Foundation of Scotland will follow soprano and common ratpetts, as well as northern ear-eared ratpetts and water-eared ratpetts at the Inverewe Botanical Garden, located in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations of the property to keep track of the ratpenat's activities during the season.
Volunteers and staff from the UK National Health Service will also conduct mobile surveys with portable detectors.
The sound analysis of the recordings by experts will determine the sound frequency of the ratpenats and what each species does.
With this information, a report and a habitat map will be created to create a detailed landscape-scale image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, conservation advisor to the National Foundation of Scotland, hopes the results will show which areas of habitat are most important to ratpenets and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as grassland creation, and how to improve forest maintenance for rat and other associated species.
The rat population in Scotland and the rest of the UK has declined considerably in the last century.
Building construction and restoration tasks threaten rat-like species, as they affect nests and can cause habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose a risk, as do paper mosquitoes and chemical treatments used in building materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
In fact, rats are not blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when catching prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to locate insects and obstacles that interfere with their flight.
The National Foundation of Scotland, responsible for overseeing 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes ratpenates very seriously.
It has ten experts with the appropriate training, who conduct surveys, nest inspections and, sometimes, rescues on a regular basis.
The organisation has even created Scotland's first and only rat-specific reserve at the Threave Estate estate, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten rat-species.
The estate's administrator, David Thompson, claims it is the ideal territory for the species.
"Here, in Threave, we have a large area for rats", he says.
We have old buildings, many old trees and a good habitat.
But we still don't know many aspects of rats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to grow.
It notes the importance of checking for any cracks before carrying out maintenance tasks on property, as the possible unintentional destruction of a single maternity nest could kill more than 400 females and young people, potentially resulting in the disappearance of an entire local population.
Rat-eaters are protected and it is illegal to kill, attack, harass and destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an official at the Scottish Rat Conservation Foundation, has encouraged people to step up to help.
He stated the following: "We still have a lot to learn from rats and, in the case of some of our species, we don't have enough data on their population".
Ronaldo denies the rape allegations while his lawyers prepare a lawsuit against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has indicated that the rape allegations against him are "false news" and has claimed that people "want to make themselves famous" thanks to his name.
His lawyers will sue the German weekly Der Spiegel, responsible for publishing the charges.
The Portugal and Juventus forward has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Presumably, he paid at the time $375,000 to keep the incident from becoming public, according to information published Friday by Der Spiegel.
In a video on Instagram Live addressing his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were made public, Ronaldo, 33, claimed they were "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no, no, you know what?
What they said today, fake news, says the five-time winner of the Golden Boot on camera.
They want to make themselves famous by my name.
It's all right.
They want to use my name to make themselves famous, but it's part of my job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine, the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are already preparing the lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the allegations, which they have described as "unacceptable information about suspicious private life", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz has stated that the player will seek compensation for "moral damage" for an amount corresponding to the severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most flagrant personal rights violations in recent years.
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her, according to reports filed with the Clark County Courthouse in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo knelt after the alleged incident and told him he was a 99% good guy, except for a 1%.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that both had sex, but they were granted consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and was photographed of her injuries in the hospital, but later accepted an out-of-court settlement because she had "fear of reprisals" and was worried about "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she is seeking to cancel the deal, as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to sign for Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged incident and this summer he signed for Italian giant Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK would always regret losing carmakers
The UK would always regret it, if it lost its position as the world leader in manufacturing after Brexit, according to Greg Clark, Secretary of State for Economic Affairs.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota's UK base had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without reaching any agreement, it would temporarily halt production at the Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need a deal", Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cause job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis models, produced 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal at the end of March, production at our factory will be halted", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Leaving the EU without any agreement on how trade with the rest of the EU will work has raised fears from other UK carmakers, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close the Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers consider to be risks in the production chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is made on a just-in-time basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers from the UK and European Union for automotive manufacturing.
If the UK leaves the European Union without reaching an agreement on 29 March, there may be border disturbances, which the sector believes could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, according to the company, and production would have to be stopped as a result.
Clark claims that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks".
"We need to reach an agreement. We want to get the best deal that allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy the success we have now, but also to seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
Trials not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, indicate that we need to be able to continue with a successful set of production chains.
Toyota has not been able to confirm how long production would be halted, but, in the long run, it has warned that the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and could cause job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is Unite the Union's coordinator at the plant, has stated that members are beginning to be very concerned about the situation: "In my experience, when these jobs are lost, they never come back".
A government spokesman said: "We have designed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU".
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be delayed again
Donald Trump's long-awaited meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be delayed by a week as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, White House officials said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian election interference, ties between Russia and Trump's aid and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump fires the deputy attorney general and jeopardizes Mueller's independence has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and also the possibility of impeaching the president with the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein has denied the information.
But last Monday he went to the White House amid rumors that he was about to resign.
However, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump has stated that he would rather not fire Rosenstein, but postponed the meeting to avoid a confrontation with the hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, further delaying the vote in the entire Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied as follows: "No date has yet been set, it could be this week, although it may be delayed for one more week for all matters with the Supreme Court.
I always like keeping the press informed.
Some journalists may dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a White House briefing since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders responded that the lack of news sessions was not because he didn't like the boasting of television journalists, though he said: "I won't deny they are boasters".
He then hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The president does more question and answer sessions than any previous president, he said, before adding the following without citing any source: We consulted these data.
Sanders has said that briefings will continue to take place, but if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, it's infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do this often, you've seen us do it a lot in the last few weeks, and they'll replace the briefings when you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with officials on official visit.
Individual press rounds are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, after an informal and sometimes strange appearance, he is in front of the press.
The Secretary of Health writes to EU workers at the Scottish National Health Service over fears of Brexit
The Secretary of Health has written to the EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service to express their gratitude to the country and wishes that they continue to do so after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, Member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months after the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the cost of residence status applications for EU citizens working in the delegated public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote the following: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union on the exit have continued, and everything seems to be heading towards the expected decisions this fall.
But the UK government has also begun preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very difficult time for all of you.
I therefore want to reiterate that I greatly appreciate the contribution of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Partners from the EU and beyond provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare, while benefiting patients and the communities we treat.
Of course, Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie has undergone an emergency operation after suffering a head injury Saturday in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to information from Mike Organ of the Tennessean.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told the press the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
"He came to the sidelines and crashed there", Reed said.
The coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen to the band before putting him in a litter and taking him away for further testing.
A Tennessee State official has informed Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been released from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is still no information about the type or extent of the injury and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury occurred.
It's Abercrombie's first season as a sophomore at Tennessee State after signing from Illinois.
He had completed five playoff appearances on Saturday before leaving the game, making a total of 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty on buying a property in the UK with the additional money used to help the homeless under the new Conservative Party plans.
This action will neutralize the success of Corbyn's movement to attract young voters.
The increase in stamp duty will be taxed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
Hisenda hopes to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers are expected to be charged a higher stamp duty on buying property in the UK and this money will be used to help homeless people, a measure that Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's movement to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing that would affect higher incomes.
The stamp duty increase will be taxed on those individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK; this money will go to government action to combat the numbers of homeless people.
The overhead, which will be added to the current stamp duty, including the highest levels introduced two years ago in second homes and real estate speculations, could be up to 3%.
Hisenda expects to get up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are owned by non-British residents, which raises prices and makes it difficult for new buyers to step up to the property scale.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost towns due to the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
The new measure comes weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp duty reduction to help young people have their first home.
He accused the large construction companies of keeping property prices high by buying land quickly and not using it, and urged May to cancel quotas on affordable homes to correct Britain's housing disaster.
Corbyn has announced a number of attractive real estate reforms proposed, such as rental controls and the completion of the 'no-fault' removal.
He also wants to give more power to the town halls to build new homes.
May has stated the following: "Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream: life must improve for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken real estate market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and create a life here.
However, it cannot be right that it is equally easy for people who do not live in the UK, as well as for companies based abroad, to buy housing compared to hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too distant and the indignity of homeless people makes it all the more real.
Jack Ross: My biggest ambition is to train Scotland
Sunderland coach Jack Ross has stated that his biggest ambition is to be Scotland's coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot has accepted the challenge of reviving the North East club, which currently sits third in League One, three points ahead of the leader.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after returning to St Mirren in the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
I was called up once as a supporting act and that's it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But I grew up watching a lot of Scotland play in Hampden with my dad when I was a kid and it always makes me go back in time.
This opportunity will only come to me if I succeed in coaching clubs, though.
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland coach include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach claims he doesn't feel the pressure to be next on a list of names enshrined in such a large team, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For now, my criterion for measuring my success will be whether I can get this team back to the Premier League.
With the club's structure and facilities, it is obvious that its place is the Premier League, he has said.
It's not easy to get there, but I'd only consider myself successful here if I could get the club back.
Ross has only three years of coaching experience, after a stint as second-team coach at Dumbarton and 15 months at the Hearts technical staff.
He helped Alloa avoid relegation to the third tier and transformed the St Mirren from fighters to champions of the Championship the following season.
Ross claims he feels more comfortable now than during his time as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
It was probably a decisive moment, he recalled about accepting the position at the Alloa.
I always thought training was the best thing I could do, more than playing.
It sounds weird because I did it right, I got out of it reasonably and I had pretty good, hard times.
But playing can be very hard.
There's a lot you have to get through every week.
I still do in things like stress and work pressure, but I feel good as a coach.
I've always wanted to train, and now I'm doing it, which is the most comfortable time I've felt since I've grown up.
You can listen to the full interview on Sportsound on Sunday 30 September on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 UK time
The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, according to a study.
The summer heat wave has skyrocketed consumption in Britain's bar-to-bars, but added more pressure to restaurant chains.
Bars and chain bars have seen a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but restaurant consumption has fallen by 4.8%, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, of the financial advisory firm CGA, the company that collected the data, says the following: Continuous hours of sunshine and England's participation in the World Cup, which has extended beyond expectation, have led to a similar pattern in July to June, with a 2.8% increase in bars, except for restaurants, which have suffered even more.
The 1.8% reduction in consumption in restaurants in June has worsened in July.
Bars and taverns, led by beverage consumption, have been achieving the best results, while consumption in restaurants has been down.
Restaurants have also been hit by the sun, although not as dramatic as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink.
In the bars and taverns we consulted, drinks sales have increased by 6.6% over the month, while food sales have fallen by 3%.
Paul Newman, of leisure and hotel analysts RSM, has stated the following: These results continue the trend we have seen since late April.
The timing and impact of major social or sporting events continue to be the main factors related to external leisure market sales.
It's no surprise that restaurants continue to have problems, but a 4.8% year-on-year decline in sales would be especially damaging, more than the continued cost pressure.
This long, hot summer couldn't have come at a worse time for food stores and the weather will tell if the more moderate temperatures we had in August will provide this much needed breath.
The total increase in bar and restaurant sales, including those recently opened, was 2.7% in July, given the slowdown in brand presentation.

One in five kids have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
One in five kids, some 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that hide from parents and teachers, according to survey data.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated an increase in Insta's fake pages
The news has raised fears about posting sexual content
20% of students say they have a primary account that they show their parents
One in five kids, some 11 years old, create social media accounts that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated a rapid increase in fake Instagram accounts, a reference to Instagram, the site for sharing photos.
The news has raised fears about posting sexual content.
20% of students say they have a net main account that they show their parents, while they also have a private one.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account saw a message from a teenager urging others to rape her.
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent Schools' Committee of Principals (HMC), has revealed that 40% of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, half of whom admitted to having private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan has stated the following: "It is disturbing that many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the athlete's vice-chair of the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed as a non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Federation board at the organisation's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those guiding the sport to benefit from their diluted international experience over the past decade.
Eilidh is respected by the athletics community in Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are confident that Scottish athletics will benefit from its inclusion in the directive, Beattie said.
Doyle has stated the following: "I am eager to act as the voice of athletes and hope to grow the sport and contribute to it in Scotland".
The American, who won gold in the 200 and 400 at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, among a total of four Olympic bears and is currently a regular commentator for the BBC, was prevented from walking after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted the following: "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time will tell if I can recover or to what extent.
It's been exhausting, but I've recovered from it all, I've learned to walk again, and today we have to do agility exercises!
Thank you for the messages of soul!
A newsletter advertisement comparing mothers to cows divides opinion on the Internet
A newsletter company has shared the opinion on the Internet with an ad that compares nursing mothers to breastfeeding cows.
To mark the launch of what is considered the world's first portable silent newsletter, consumer technology company Elvie has issued an advertisement inspired by a humorous music video to show the freedom the new newsletter gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of garbage and cows to the beat of a song that includes lyrics like: "Yes, I feed myself, but you won't see any quarrels and if you hadn't noticed, they're not braggers, but my tits".
The tour continues: Bomber, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, feed the girls.
However, the announcement, posted on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mixed reaction from viewers, many of whom claim it shows the horrors of the dairy industry.
Very bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, with the difference being that they are separated from their babies a few days after giving birth, wrote one person.
The Elvie column is hidden discreetly in a lactation holder (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented: Comprehensibly traumatic for the mother and baby.
But why not use them to advertise a newsletter for mothers who will keep their babies?
Another user added: "It's an off-site ad".
Other people defended the ad; one woman admitted that she found the song to be "fun".
I think it's a great idea.
I'd buy one if I had to breastfeed.
Pumping for the trigger made me feel exactly like a cow.
The announcement is a little crazy, but it has to be taken for granted.
It's a great product, wrote a user.
Another person commented: It's a fun ad aimed at mothers who are bombarded with napkins (usually at their workplace or in the laundry room and feel like they're cows.
It's not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women show that they've all danced with the bracelet quietly stuck to the supporters.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women say they feel like cows when they use the helmet.
However, the Elvie strap is completely silent, has no cable or tube and fits discreetly into a breastfeeding bra, giving women more freedom to move, suckle babies and even go outside while pumping.
Mother's early childhood partner and developer, Ana Balarin, has stated the following: The Elvie newsletter is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative campaign.
In drawing the parallels between women and cows, we wanted to show the public how a thumbnail is used and the challenges involved, while also showing, in an entertaining and educational way, the incredible sense of freedom that the new thumbnail offers.
This isn't the first time the Elvie column has been in the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children, quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children retained has increased despite monthly border crossings being virtually stable, partly because harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made child adoption difficult.
Traditionally, most step-parents were undocumented immigrants, who have been afraid to risk their chances of staying in the country if they decide to adopt a child.
The risk has increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential parents and other adults living in their homes will have to send fingerprints, which will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Service, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested to take in unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
Nearly 80% of people who have been or are living in a host's home are in the country illegally, and a large majority of them are foreign criminals.
So we will continue to pursue these people, Albence declared.
To process children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring some to appear in court within a month of being detained, instead of the previous standard of 60 days, according to shelter workers.
Many of them would appear by videoconference, rather than in person, to defend their case to obtain legal status before an immigration judge.
All those not considered eligible for assistance will be deported immediately.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent rampages or escape attempts, according to workers and reports released by the system in recent months.
Lawyers say these concerns can be intensified in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that, because of its size, signs that indicate a child is suffering are passed over.
They added that moving children to camp without having time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can cause a trauma that many already suffer.
Syria urges the occupying forces of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem urged Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country's eight-year war.
Muallem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, has claimed that foreign forces were in Syrian territory illegally under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and the matter will be handled accordingly.
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the assembly.
Muallem has insisted that the "war on terror" is virtually over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and the conflict has caused millions of displaced people.
He has stated that Damascus will continue to fight this sacred battle until we have purged all Syrian territory of both terrorist groups and any illegal foreign presence.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily to train and advise Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in a war-torn country.
On the refugee issue, Muallem has stated that the conditions were good for his return and has blamed some Western countries for fleeing irrational pockets that make refugees want to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns", he said.
They're politicizing an issue that should be purely humanitarian.
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition is reached to end the war.
UN diplomats have said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral zone at the last major rebel stronghold, Idlib, has favored the opportunity to continue political meetings.
The Russia-Turkey agreement has prevented a large-scale attack by Syrian forces with Russian help in the province, where three million people live.
However, Muallem has pointed out that the agreement has clear terms and expressed hope that the military action will confront the jihadists, which include fighters from the Al-Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, who will be eradicated.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee made up of government and opposition members soon to begin to profile a post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Muallem explained the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, whose task should be restricted to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Time
According to this logic, Trump would win the election again in 2020 except that, as many liberal viewers probably expect, scandals and the impeachment process end his presidency prematurely.
Which would, without a doubt, be the end of the most dramatic presidency in history.
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, the number of viewers at peak viewing times has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at peak viewing times, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show has led cable television audiences with up to 3.5 million viewers on prime-time news nights.
"People have been so upset they don't understand", says Neal Baer, executive producer of ABC's "Designated Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president when an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
He remembers a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 election.
The cab driver told him he would vote for Trump.
"Why?" he asked.
He replied that it was because it made him laugh, Scovell told me.
There's a point of entertainment in chaos.
Of course, unlike the TV shows, the script that comes out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite and the state of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, being an informed citizen is going further when you're in the sixth hour of watching a group of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of sources for private use for his book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 oyster leather jacket (a piece of clothing as thick as his pride, headlined the Washington Post) and the consequences of Stormy Daniels' horrific descriptions of, say, Trump's anatomy.
In my case, I'm not going to see Super Mario like that again.
"Part of what makes it seem like a reality TV show is that every night it gives you something new", says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about the character changes and script rounds of Trump's show (fighting the NFL, praising Kim Jong-Un).
You can't afford to miss an episode just because you're behind.
When I saw Fleiss this week, it was about 25 degrees and it was sunny outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he got locked up watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He couldn't untie, not with Brett Kavanaugh about to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in a thread.
"I remember when we were doing those spoiled programs back then and people were saying it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it seems they were right.

Foreign money floods the run-up to the midterm elections to the House of Representatives more tightly
It's no surprise that there's a flood of cash in Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district, thanks to the realignment of congressional districts that has made two current members compete for the same seat.
This recent re-appointment of the Pittsburgh suburban district involves Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb, who won the seat in another district after a special election last spring.
Lamb is facing another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is in conflict with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former districts were unconstitutionally divided in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district has sparked a financial war between the major party financial organizations, the Democratic Campaign Committee for Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb made a name for himself in Pennsylvania after a tight victory in a very close special election held in March to represent Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
Republicans have held office for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States imposes sanctions on El Salvador for its support of China, but it withdraws them.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Trump held a tense meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Valera in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until his partners fired the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials decided to remove the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan, Heather Nauert, a department spokeswoman, said this month.
However, only the possibility of sanctioning El Salvador, which received in 2017 a US$140 million aid, according to estimates, for drug trafficking control, development and economic improvements, was considered.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on visas issued, would be detrimental to the Central American country and the high death toll from homicide and stunt.
As the internal meetings progressed, officials from both countries postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity to continue a similar meeting held last year that was seen as a step forward to prevent immigrants from heading to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear they wanted the meeting to take place, effectively ending any possibility of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has been chosen for the meeting, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the administration's importance to it, according to diplomats.
The three U.S. ambassadors quietly returned to their posts in El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A spokesman for the Bolton White House declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations from the sidelines.
An outside analyst, close to the administration and also from the anonymous, corroborated the statements.
Studying history
The next event in the making could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstruction of justice, of which there is ample evidence in public records.
As far as we know, Mueller is also investigating whether Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in its election attack.
If Congress changes hands, Trump could find himself accountable to the agency, just as he prepares to do so before voters, and even a party jury.
There are many circumstantial conditions, and I don't want to suggest that the fall of Trump, or any of his European namesakes, is inevitable.
There are decisions that need to be made on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the situation will last.
In 1938, German officials were willing to stage a coup against Hitler, only if the Western bloc resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid all the years of terror that followed.
The course of history fluctuates over turning points like this and the inexorable progress of democracy accelerates or slows down.
The United States is facing several turning points today.
What if Trump fires Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been with the water around his neck since this newspaper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated he was unfit for office.
Rosenstein claims the Times' information is inaccurate.
How will we respond if the new investigation the FBI has requested into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And, especially, will we vote in the middle of a legislature for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we don't pass these tests, democracy will start to run into danger.
But I think we're not going to fail, because I already learned the lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the ambassador's house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States, and 60 years later, he sent me to light a Sabbath torch on that table with the swastika.
With this baggage, how can I not be optimistic about the future?

Graham Dorrans, Rangers, optimistic in the game against the Vienna Rapid
The Rangers receive the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, aware that a victory over the Austrians, after an impressive draw at the Vila-real field this month, would leave him in a good position to qualify for the Europa League G group.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing the first few minutes of the season until the 2-2 draw against Vila-real, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard to get great results.
"It was a positive point for us, because Vila-real is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
We played the game thinking we could get a valuable result and we got out with a point.
Maybe we could have pulled something else out of it at the end, but overall, the empire was probably a fair result.
They were better in the first part, but we were better than them in the second.
On Thursday, it's another great European night.
We hope to keep the three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they did a good job in the last game, but I'm sure we'll give it our all and get a good result with the support of the amateurs.
Last year was really tough, with the injuries I suffered and the changes at the club, but now it's a good place to be.
The team's good and the boys are enjoying it, the training is good.
I hope we can give it our all, put the past season behind us and make it work.
Women lose sleep because of fear of retirement savings
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people spoke to their family about it.
About half of respondents nationwide say they've talked to their partner about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of those surveyed say they have spoken to their children.
"People want a family member to look after them, but they don't dare to ask", said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance company Nationwide.
We have to start here.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for care if you do not communicate your wishes well in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to decide where and how to get care, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Include your financial advisor in the conversation: he can also help you determine how to pay for these expenses.
Your financing options for your long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-value hybrid life insurance policy that helps you cover expenses, or your own insurance with your own resources, if you have the money to do so.
Prepare your legal documents: step into legal battles.
Find a representative so that you can appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals meet your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
Consider also the possibility of obtaining a notary's office for your finances.
You should select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid in case of disability.
Remember the details: Imagine that your elderly relative has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Specify these details in a written plan to be prepared.
Finance is not the only factor to be determined, but also with which doctors you want to treat", Martin said.
"What are the medicines?
Who's going to take care of the dog?
Have this plan prepared".
Man shot several times with a compressed air rifle at Ilfracombe
A man has received several shots from a compressed air rifle as he was returning home after going out at night.
The victim, aged about 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
'Officers have described the shooting, which occurred around 2.30am (UK summer time), as a 'random act'.
The victim hasn't seen his attacker.
His life is not in danger from the wounds and the police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a strong earthquake and tsunami that rocked the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said.
As communications are cut off, auxiliary units have been unable to obtain information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu closest to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Cèlebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Cèlebes Central, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Cèlebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that extends along more than 300 km of coastline to the northwest of Cèlebes Island.
The regency, an administrative region below a province, had a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the mainstays of the economy of the province of Cèlebes Central, especially in the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the coast of the other end of Cèlebes.
Palu and Donggala have suffered several tsunamis in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, a tsunami also struck west of Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is in the Pacific Ring of Fire and is frequently hit by earthquakes.
The following are the main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, north of Sumatra, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Thousands of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and caused a tsunami that devastated the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake shook a populated area of Padang City, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake shook one of the Mentawai Islands off the coast of Sumatra, and caused a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected the Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, as the population recalled the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and deadly tsunami.
This time, there was no tsunami, but over 100 people died as a result of the collapsed buildings.
2018: A series of major earthquakes occurred on the tourist Indonesian island of Lombok that killed more than 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily trapped thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, a Wasilla, Alaska native, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a domestic violence report and resistance to arrest, according to a report published Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, she pulled out her phone.
Palin is being held at Mat-Su's temporary detention center, where he is being held on an unsecured bond of 500 USD, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, when he pleaded "not guilty, safely" when asked how he was pleading, according to the network.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means she could go to jail for up to a year and have to pay a fine of up to $250,000.
She is also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which carries a one-day jail term and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to notify the alleged attack.
The case is currently in the hands of the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interference with reporting a domestic violence crime and possession of a weapon in a state of intoxication in connection with the incident.
His partner stated that he had punched him in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups for associating her son's violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder derived from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Cèlebes on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down and the death toll is expected to rise over the next few days.
The earthquake struck just off the coast of Cèlebes Central, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Social media is streaming videos of the impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking an exceptional death sentence for a suspect in the New York terrorist attack.
New York federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terrorist attack that killed eight people: an extraordinary sentence that has not been applied to the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan and run over pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "intentionally" and that he "intentionally" caused serious personal injury, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both crimes could carry the death penalty, according to court documents.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury attacked Saipov with a 22-count indictment that included eight counts of murder in favor of organized crime, which federal prosecutors typically use in mafia cases, in addition to a crime of violence and motor vehicle destruction.
Prosecutors claimed that the attack required "considerable planning and premeditation" and described Saipov's manner of acting as "inhumane, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused wounds, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", according to the intent notice.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York brought a death penalty case to justice.
Defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to carry out espionage actions for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
The police explained that he told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
According to police, he also requested that the ISIS flag be flown in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts of fraud.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, claimed they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, rather than accept a guilty plea and a life sentence without the possibility of parole, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel FARAGE should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage pledged to "mobilize the people's troops" today during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former UKIP leader has said politicians must "feel the pressure of Eurosceptics" when one of Theresa May's own MPs has suggested she should lead the EU negotiations.
The incumbent Conservative MP Peter Bone told the Birmingham march that the UK would already be out of the EU if Mr Farage were Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces in reconciling her deeply divided ranks has been highlighted when pro-union conservatives have taken to another Brexit protest in La City.
The prime minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise plan between the attacks of Brexit supporters, union supporters and the EU.
Allies insist that it will reach an agreement with Brussels despite negative responses and press eurosceptics and the Conservative Party to choose between its package and chaos.
Mr Bone told the Leave Means Leave meeting in Solihull that he wanted to undo the Chequers commitment.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been appointed a member of the House of Lords and that he should have been given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
'If he had been in charge, we would have been out already,' he said.
MP Wellingborough added: "I will defend Brexit, but we must undo the Chequers commitment".
Specifically, he added: "We did not fight world wars to be servants.
We want to make our own laws in our own country".
Mr Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British population has changed mindset and wants to stay is totally false".
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and told reporters: "I just tell you, Prime Minister, to listen to the people".
"Chequers's commitment is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular within our party and our activists, who are the people who go out into the streets and get us to win an election.
Give up the Chequers commitment and start listening".
In a message to Mrs May, he added: "Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Mr Farage said the rally's politicians must feel pressure if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"That, now, is a matter of trust between us (the people) and our political class", he stated.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and today we're here to tell you that we won't let them".
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make the political class, about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure".
"We are mobilizing the people's troops of this country who gave us the victory with Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom".
Meanwhile, union supporters marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists waved banners over the Conservatives against Brexit after the group's launch this weekend.
Conservative member of the House of Lords Lord Adonis laughed at the Conservatives over the security problems they suffered with a party application at the start of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us they can have the necessary IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus agreement, for the frictionless border, for borderless free trade in Ireland", he added.
"It's a complete hoax.
There is no option for a good Brexit", he added.
Warren plans to consider running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at an open meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state representative Geoff Diehl, who was vice president of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
He has been the center of speculation about the possibility of replacing Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th open-door meeting with constituents since Trump took office.
An assistant asked him if he planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for "women to go to Washington to fix our government that's not working, and that includes a woman at the top".
A person arrested for the shooting death of Sims, LSU
Baton Rouge, La., police announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at the ET news conference at 11:00.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for collaboration to identify the man in the shooting.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims received a gunshot to the head that ultimately killed him", police officer Murphy J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and received a shot from Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being on the scene, in possession of a weapon, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton County Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-2, batting average who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins the world title after the team's orders delivered him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas stood in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and nearly exhausted Hamilton while defending his position on the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel got in the boxes earlier and let Hamilton run with the traffic on the back of the package, which should have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes had to stop boxing and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after some wheel-to-wheel action that caused the Ferrari driver to leave the free interior with the risk of being left out after a double move to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in the last row of the grid and at the end of the first lap he was in seventh position on his 21st birthday.
He then continued in good position for much of the race, as he kept his wheels to save time, advancing to Kimi Raikkonen and moving to fourth position.
He finally entered the boxes on lap 44, but was unable to increase the pace on the next eight laps and Raikkonen placed fourth.
It's a tough day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman who was told to let me through.
The team did a fantastic job of having a U-two", said Hamilton.
His body language was terrible.
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday to insist that she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
At a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people are "bad, cruel and liars".
"One thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that's happening these last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see angry, mean, cruel and lying people", he said.
"When you look at the communications and the leaks and they say, "No, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me".
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember his answer -- did you leak the document?
No, no, I'm not.
I didn't filter it".
Hey, wait a minute.
We filtered... no, we didn't filter it", he added while imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing Ford's statements against Kavanaugh in July and leaked it in September, but Feinstein denied the leak came from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's statements, I didn't leak her story", Feinstein explained to the committee, according to The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, just like he asked me".
But his denial didn't please the president, who commented at the meeting Saturday night, "You know what?
It may not have, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen".
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the statements for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by the means necessary.
You see evil, cruelty, they don't care who does evil, who they have to run over to have power and control", the President said, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars repaired Friday's Elite defeat to the Belfast Giants, as they won the home game 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants immediately gained a two-goal lead thanks to the finishes of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie raised their team level, but then Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard tied the Dundee, and then two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured his victory.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had just won Dundee 2-1 at Belfast on Friday.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams and the Giants had won the previous three games.
The first goal came from Dwyer's hand in the fourth minute, at 3:35, with an assist from Kendall McFaull.
During this turbulent initial period, Sullivan re-placed the home team to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt facilitated the equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead at the first break when he scored the second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and, again, Bouchard contributed to his level with a powerful goal in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time during the match at the end of the second half and secured his team's victory with the fifth goal near the end of the match.
The Giants, who have already lost four of their last five games, are at home in Milton Keynes and have their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies to save hundreds of passengers from an earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller has become a hero after he dies to ensure a plane carrying hundreds of passengers lands safely.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a major earthquake hit the island of Cèlebes on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Many replicas are occurring in the area and there are many people trapped among the runes in the city of Palu.
But despite his companions escaping to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his seat at the tremendous control tower of Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He stayed in his seat to ensure that Batik Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take the flight safely.
Then he came out of the air traffic control tower when he thought he was sinking.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation, Indonesia's Yohannes Sirait, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"That broke our hearts", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, while the disaster mitigation agency has said access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The death toll is expected to rise because there are still many bodies under the runes and many that have not been accessed", said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves, up to six metres high, have devastated Palu, which will hold a joint funeral on Sunday.
The military and some commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance carries bodies.
Drinking water is scarce.
All the minimerke has been looted".
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working around the clock to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find.
This is a tragedy, but it could get worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the armed forces: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the evacuation related tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia suffered another earthquake this year in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini says a man has now gone missing after the crash at the lagoon
The airline that operated a flight to a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says a man has gone missing, although it previously said the 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that, since Saturday afternoon, they had not found a passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find him.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Islands airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been taken to a hospital.
The airline said that on Saturday there were six passengers still in the hospital and that they were all in good condition.
The exact cause of the accident and sequence of events is still unknown.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy claimed the plane hit the gap because the runway was short.
Some witnesses believe the plane overtook the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes explained that the plane was going very low.
"That was extremely positive", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers managed to walk with water around their waists to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants panicked and began to scream, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to improve a mill also helped with the rescue with an inflatable boat to carry the affected people ashore before the plane sank about 30 meters into the water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in PNG, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
An analyst composes a timeline of the night a woman was burned alive
Prosecutors closed the case on Saturday in a review of the trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used the cell phone records to build the movements of the accused, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night he died.
Rowlett said she received location data from different mobile phones showing Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contradicting her earlier statements, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford denied it and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was in Sanford's van that night, Sanford said he had lied, since his van was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Phone records indicated they'd only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that, some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from her phone.
"He erased her from his life", Hale said.
The defense plans to begin its final arguments Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury over the course of the same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio fills their music with positive messages to challenge the negative view of the genre.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims hip-hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and bring conscious hip-hop back into fashion.
Some artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have experienced a recent resurgence in the UK from artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
NY motherfucker demands a couple be fired after a "racist" message
A New York nanny has sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected text message from her mother protesting that she was "another black person".
The couple denies they are racist and compare the lawsuit to a "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dismay at the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, being black when she arrived at work on the first day of 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOO Another Black Person", Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After realizing her pimp, a "uncomfortable" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, all the while claiming that the nanny she had fired, who was African American, had done her job poorly and that she was expecting a Filipino person, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received her payment for her workday and was then sent home in an Uber.
Now Maurice is demanding compensation from the couple for the dismissal and is asking for compensation of, approximately, $350 a day for the six-month residency job for which they had hired her, even though there was no contract.
"I want to show you that you can't do things like that", he explained to the Post on Friday, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple have responded to statements that they are racist while claiming that Maurice's dismissal was the most reasonable, as they were afraid they could not trust her after offending her.
"My wife sent him something she didn't want to say.
He's not racist.
We are not racist people", said her husband, Joel Plasco, in the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've been crawling with, even if it was by mistake?
A baby?
Come on in".
Plasco, who has compared the lawsuit to an "extortion", said his wife had two months to have a baby and was in a "very difficult situation".
"You're going after something like that?
It's not a very kind attitude", the investment banker added.
The legal case is still unsolved and the court of public opinion has rushed to denounce the couple on social media and condemn their behavior and logic.
Paddington's editors feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, according to a new letter.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It is difficult to put yourself in the place of someone who first links it before its publication.
It's funny, now that we know what we know about Paddington's big success".
She explained that her father, who had worked as a camera operator for the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about a small teddy bear, was optimistic about the book's rejection.
He describes Paddington as a very important member of his family and I'm sure his father was very proud of the success he finally achieved.
"He was a discreet man; he was not a presumptuous one", she said.
"But, as Paddington was so real to him, it was practically like when your son achieves something: you're proud, even if it's not your thing.
I think that's how he viewed Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always acknowledged Paddington's own merit".
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Upon landing, they rushed her to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked to save her life.
"Nad would often call to say that it was very serious and that they didn't expect me to get over it", commented Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad and she told me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, beautiful.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll go with you.
The medicines that had been given to keep his body beating were being consumed and were coming out of his system.
He died before it was scheduled, and that was how it all ended.
All he had to do was sit back and wait, knowing what was happening.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by family and more people.
I had to keep my form".
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the rest of the passengers, distracted by the experience she was going through.
"Nobody knew", he said.
"I had my head cut off and tears kept falling.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt a sense of sympathy for Nad the overwhelming.
The feeling that needed my love and my understanding.
I know I loved her very much".
Women of sorrows are wearing suicide cards on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are working to prevent others from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been hanging cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that citizens can call for assistance.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and, at 18, committed suicide.
"I don't want any father or mother to feel what I have to feel every day", she said.
Mrs Davis, 45, of Lydney, said her son was a promising boss with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that her smile could light up any room".
However, he left his job before he died because he was in a "very dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after taking his own life.
Ms. Davis stated, "I'm constantly concerned that there will be a side effect".
Ms. Davis created the cards "so people know that there are people they can reach out to, that they can listen to, even if it's a friend.
Do not keep silent; you must speak".
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after the death of Mark's mother.
"He never said he was not well or depressed or anything like that", she said.
"A couple of days before Christmas we noticed a change in attitude.
He touched down on Christmas Day, when the children opened their presents and he didn't look them in the eye or anything".
He said that their deaths were a great trauma for them, but they had to work it out: "Open a hole in the family.
It's destroying us.
But we must continue and fight".

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins an investigation.
"I thought that if we could get something like what he was asking for (an investigation with a limited scope and time), we could get some unity", Mr Flake said on Saturday.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
His reticence is about the moment.
If, as expected, the Republicans fail to get good results, they will see weakness in getting the man they want elected to the top court in the country.
George W. Bush has been taking the phone to call the senators and pressuring them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush. He also met his wife Ashley through Mr. Bush, as his personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI believes your report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where, at present, there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to untie the impeachment and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
North Korean deserters "fall" with Kim
The number of North Korean deserters in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Southern Unification, said there were 1,127 desertions last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said strict border controls between North Korea and China and rising prices charged by human traffickers had been the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Normally, the vast majority of North Korean deserters are offered South Korean citizenship.
Sources in Seoul say more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors illegal migrants, rather than refugees, and often repatriates them by force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks centered on the stalled negotiations on denuclearization.
This came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work towards a Korean peninsula free of nuclear energy.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not disarm unilaterally first", Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is a "historian" and unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said that the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is a "historic" and that his temperament makes him unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival held in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman had acted this way, they would have called her a 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said in relation to her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh, excited, denied allegations of sexually abusing Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes screaming and speechless as he talked about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's Democrats and said the charges against him amounted to a "grotesque and coordinated murder of a character" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh's testimony showed he could not work at the Supreme Court, as it showed his prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats", he said.
Pelosi showed reluctance when asked if she would try to challenge Kavanaugh's election, if it is confirmed, and if Democrats win a majority in the House of Representatives.
"This is what I can say: if you don't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, you're not only unable to be in the Supreme Court, but you're not able to be in the court where you are now", Pelosi commented.
Kavanaugh currently serves as a judge on the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about the decisions Kavanaugh might make against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as she considered herself a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearings, he avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Superior Court.
"It's not the time for a hysterical and prejudiced person to come into the courtroom and hope that we look wonderful", Pelosi said.
Women must exercise their power.
It's a justified diatribe: months and years of abundant rage and you can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's uncommon. What about you?"
She continued, "I was a great help from a woman who was an executive somewhere who told me that she also cried when she was angry, but that she developed a tactic that was, when she was angry and started crying, to tell the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm upset".
And then he kept going.
It looked brilliant to me".
Tears are allowed as an escape from anger in part because, basically, they're misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my early jobs in a mostly male office, where I once ended up crying with an indescribable rage, is that of an older woman (a cold executive who had always frightened me a little bit) who grabbed me from the crib and dragged me up the staircase.
"Never let them see you cry", she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they'll have you".
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was discovered on an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, thought there was no reason not to explore the idea of running herself as a presidential candidate.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", she said laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone said "Blanc and the Seven Dwarfs".
As she arrived late in the campaign, she was lagging behind in fundraising, so she vowed not to enter the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, were only willing to give her $250.
"Do they think I have a discount?" he asked himself.
When she delivered her speech and announced that she would not start a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions (gratitude for the people who had helped her, frustration with the system for the difficulty of collecting money and for orienting herself to voters, instead of doing so to delegates, and anger, and sexism) that she ran out of words.
"You might have thought I was having a nervous breakdown", Mrs. Schroeder recalled about the press reaction.
"You might have thought my corporate sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking, what will they put in my grave?
"Did he cry?"
How the US-China Trade War Can Benefit Beijing
The initial salves of the US-China trade war were deafening, and while the war does not seem to have to end anytime soon, a distance between the countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, issued his first warning earlier this year, when he imposed taxes on China's main exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week, with new tariffs affecting products worth $200 billion, which are taxing half of all goods coming to the U.S. from China.
Beijing has repeatedly counterattacked in the same way and recently raised tariffs from five to 10 percent on US$60 billion worth of goods.
China has committed to replicating the US and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to slow down anytime soon.
Making Washington back means giving in to some demands, but publicly bowing to the US would be too shameful for Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
Still, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressures of the trade war with the US could benefit China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a swift political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions to start a fall in either of these countries is far more dangerous than witnesses had predicted", says Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused research associate at the Center for New American Security, a committee of experts.
Syria is "prepared" to return refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of the refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country, devastated by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
In front of the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Currently, the situation on the streets is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas that terrorists destroyed to restore normalcy.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country who had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and maintenance are met.
The EU estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
There are also six million people living in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would appreciate any help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries that financed the insurgency.
European team wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has already lost six straight times on European soil and hasn't won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team won the crown again when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's reached the 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who fought for most of the tournament, threw the exit shot into the water at hole 3-16, giving the win to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all of his series and became one of only four players to have achieved a 5-0-0 record since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was sidelined with a 5&4 by the less qualified player from the European team Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The world's most qualified player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the tournament's all-time leading scorer with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a very rough year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to have my glass back.
The team is the most important... and I'm glad I could help", said an excited Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the relay to fellow American golfer John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in an individual competition on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, I grew up following him", said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now has a Ryder Cup career record of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the best players ever, with 14 major titles won and only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. national team struggled all weekend to find the course, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's frustrating performance: "I'm proud of these players, they've fought.
There was a moment this morning when we pressed the European team.
We fought.
I'm getting the hang of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
Your 12 players have played very well.
We'll regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and move forward.
I love these 12 players and I'm proud to have been their captain.
It's a way to get rid of the barrel.
They have defeated us".
Red tide update: concentrations are reduced in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general reduction in red tide concentrations in certain parts of the Tampa Bay area.
