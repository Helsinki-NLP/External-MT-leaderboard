Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
The two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement and Tehran's destabilizing measures in the Middle East.
The meeting is also expected to address the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years.
Washington criticizes Israel's ongoing settlement and accuses Netanyahu of a lack of will to the peace process.
The deal Obama announced for Iran's nuclear program has further worsened the relationship between the two.
In March, Netanyahu, at the invitation of the Republicans, delivered a controversial speech to the US Congress, which was in part seen as an affront to Obama.
The speech was not delivered to Obama, a meeting he had rejected with reference to the upcoming election in Israel.
In an emergency call, Professor confesses to shooting his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police in a slightly angry voice that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officers had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to emphasize that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said the dead woman's family contacts could be found on the phone.
Inside the house, officials found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note that was written on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wish I could reverse it, I loved Amy and she's the only woman who ever loved me".
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had traveled 300 miles to the school grounds, where he shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of his office, police said.
Delta State University Chief of Police Lynn Buford said university staff heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb made the fatal emergency call afterwards.
By the end of the day, there was another death: Lamb took his own life when the police put him in jail.
One day after the shooting at the university, when students and faculty were forced to hide behind closed doors, authorities are still trying to get a picture of what motivated Lamb.
The details published by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and staff who knew him said, helped to paint a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his class.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, which has 17 members, and many students attended courses of both.
At the same time, there was some tendency towards problematic behaviour.
One student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little upset and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him".
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamm told him that he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for medical leave, saying he had some sort of health problem.
He taught only two online courses this year.
Recent changes in the university's employment policy meant that the promotion Lamb had worked so hard for would not guarantee him an automatic path to an assistant professor position.
University president William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's idea".
These are questions that Lamb can't answer anymore.
After escaping from campus, police later found Lamb's trail as he reentered Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said.
His car was still running in the driveway.
It wasn't immediately clear why Lamb went to that house, but Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started his career at the university in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000, teaching geography and pedagogy.
He got his PhD in education in the spring.
One of Lamb's longtime friends described him as intelligent, charismatic, and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who spent a few years trying to teach her how to play guitar.
He was the female heirloom back then.
All the girls fused in when he was there", said Hairston, now 40, who lives in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for a while.
In the emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife", but there was no marriage certificate.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in the brick house that adjoins a bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago, but they remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19.
"She was totally devastated", O'Steen said of his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at a summer annual market three years ago.
Later, they played one or the other gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a light-damaged bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss Night on the night of September 5th after Lamb finished his guitar and vocal harmonica playing in front of a limited audience.
There was no sign that anything was wrong.
"Just a happy couple", he said.
We were cleaning up and joking.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first semester seminar program and specialized in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, a professor of English at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He attended Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and student body.
At Delta State Campus in Cleveland, about 900 people, including faculty, staff, students, and community members, attended a candlelight memorial service on Tuesday night.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the wake, while the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back", LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that the police now say Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt, and that while Lamb in his emergency call referred to Prentiss as his wife, there is no indication that the two were ever married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas
Toys R Us says it won't hire as many Christmas-season employees as last year, but the toy and baby-shop says it will give the employees and seasonal workers it currently employs a chance to work more hours.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country, and another 45,000 were hired at Christmas 2014.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said it will start recruitment talks this month and the number of employees will increase from October to December.
With the holidays themselves months away, Christmas business is moving closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary staff to equip stores with employees who sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was remarkable for personal reasons, too.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I noticed that the seat next to me was empty, and it's becoming clear to me that Princess Diana will be sitting next to me", he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary, "Back in Time".
The movie starts, and it comes to mind that I'm a simulated moaning and arm's length away from being on a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time, a documentary about Back to the Future, features interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
Back for the Future premiered 30 years ago.
"It's really for me", Spielberg said, "unquestionably the greatest time travel movie ever made".
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and select theaters in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's increased military support for Syria is "There is no military solution" to the nearly five-year conflict, and more weapons will only exacerbate violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN chief reiterates his call on all parties, including the UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a news conference on Wednesday that he planned to meet the foreign ministers of the five permanent members of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly's ministerial meeting later this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions within the Council and within the Syrian people and regional powers "make this situation insoluble".
Mr Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria as they did in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 survey results that show that Donald Trump is to be taken seriously.
Some tried to brand him as a flop.
Others called it a joke.
And some are waiting for a breakdown.
But no matter how many Republicans try to pull Donald Trump from the top of the polls, it hasn't worked.
Ten of the last 11 national polls showed Donald Trump leading in the double-digit area, and some are starting to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of being nominated by the real estate mogul.
Of course, it is still too early in the election period.
No one is claiming that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry's leadership was handed over to the rising Herman Cain, none of whom won a single state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he should be running in a general election.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Trump's resilience and start pouring their dollars to bring him down.
Here are some recent survey data that indicate that the real estate market is not just a temporary phase:
Trump's popularity has swung 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positively.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three in ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these numbers are still in early states.
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump were nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they'd be "angry" if he was the candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same amount of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they'd be "enthusiastic" versus 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
Next up in excitement?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "angry" if Jeb Bush, the establishment's favorite, were to run.
A majority of Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and offensive statements, 52 percent of Republican-leaning Irish voters believe the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, according to ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the nation's first-ever elected state, Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a commander in chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Yet 44 percent think he doesn't have the personality to effectively carry out his duties, and nearly six out of 10 independents say his temperament doesn't fit in with the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they put on their scholarly cloak, Republican voters think Trump is real.
When asked who's most likely to win the GOP nomination, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week, four out of ten say Trump is the best bet.
That's a change from the time four out of ten put their money on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters have not had the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this point in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought Rick Perry would win the nomination against only 28 percent for the final candidate Mitt Romney.
Yet it turns out that a large number of GOP voters consider Trump's campaign plausible.
Even if the Republicans were rallying around another candidate, Trump would still beat almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffusely distributed to more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump wins the majority of the vote.
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, 14 points ahead of Marco Rubio, 15 points ahead of Walker, 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush and finally 33 points ahead of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would have overtaken the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A narrow majority of Donald Trump fans say they've formed their mind.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that just over half of the voters who support Trump say they've cast their ballots firmly.
Of course, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really say never change their mind.
46 percent said they'd leave the door open to switch to other candidates.
Yet Trump's strongest competition right now is the other outsider, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they've formed their mind are twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in his election speech two months ago, immigration has been a hotbed of public discourse in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombastic expression will keep key Hispanic Americans away from the Republican Party and damage reorientation efforts.
But according to the new ABC/Post poll Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will apparently do so.
The frustration with the government is climbing to new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now have about half the support of Republican voters, especially because of their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new Monday poll from ABC/Post that they prefer a political outsider to someone with government experience.
And they're also angry at Washington.
A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa two weeks ago found that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with the Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "horribly upset".
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
Here in the Hobooken Road is the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea.
On the street, a square meter of a reed roof house costs an average of 73,300 euros.
"The supply of objects is naturally limited at Sylt", says the study, hence the high price.
A new study shows which particular locations cost the most a square meter.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square meter for a student store in Munich is not really a small amount.
Unlike Germany's top rated, one of the prices looks like peanuts.
The real estate services company Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential areas - with square meter prices at dizzying heights.
There are tens of thousands of euros per square meter, you know.
But who can afford it...
By the way, Munich is not the top of the line, by any means.
Champions League: Bayern's dream start thanks to Mueller and Götze
Two-time goalkeeper in Piraeus: Bayern star Thomas Müller has just one run.
A happy hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to a deserved 3-0 win at Olympiakos Piraeus - then it went.
A sovereign start to the Champions League season.
World champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have given FC Bayern a dream start in the "Mission Milan" in the witch's boiler of Piraeus.
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their opening match in the Champions League at the Greek record-breaking Olympiakos in a hot atmosphere thanks to Muller's double-pack (52./90.+2) and Götzen's hit (89.) earned with 3:0 (0:0).
The twelfth start in the series is supposed to be the first step towards the final on May 28, 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to get the Henkelpot to Munich in the third inning.
Müller received a kind help from Olympiakos torchbearer Roberto during his 28th Champions League win over Bayern, who passed a shot that was thought to be a flank of the world champion.
"We will not underestimate them", Bayern captain Philipp Lahm had promised before the game at the Karaiskakis stadium to 31,688 fan-hot-blooded fans - and the Munichers kept their word.
They showed a focused and committed vision without glowing.
Piraeus had won his last six home games in the King's class, including against famous clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund also stumbled here (1:3).
But Bayern, undefeated in seven European Cup matches against Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They were courageous, but often too unimaginative in their offensive efforts.
The attacks were too often initiated by left-handed Douglas Costa, who rarely made it against former Brunswick forward Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller was more lucky from the right side when his right half-field flank hit the top left corner.
In the 67th minute, the world champion gave up the possible 2-0.
The best chances in half a century were Robert Lewandowski.
First, when Olympiakos striker Ideye Brown hit the Polish headball off the line (26).
Then by direct shooting, the goalkeeper Roberto pared with his knee (35).
Although Bayern were playing their usual dominant game, Piraeus could put needle sticks.
But Manuel Neuer was the goalie.
For example, when he directed a shot of Ideye over the latte (56).
Earlier, Guardiola had a four-man line with David Alaba in the centre next to Jerome Boateng, who did well.
Mario Götze, after muscle problems back in the squad, sat out first.
The World Cup champion did not give the green light until after the final training, sports director Matthias Sammer told Sky: "Whoever wants to make something different out of it is already evil".
Guardiola also opted against him on the first transfer, when he brought Kingsley Coman for the batted Lewandowski (59).
Götze arrived late for Arturo Vidal (76) and 13 minutes later made everything clear, with Müller putting another one on it by eleven metres.
Before the game, there was a crawling at the stadium.
After a smaller group of partially disguised Bayern fans in their audience block had apparently provoked the supporters of the host Piräus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and went on strike against the Munich supporters.
At least one Bayern fan was transported from the stadium injured.
Smokers are at higher risk of losing teeth
Smoking not only damages the lungs but also the teeth, according to a Potsdam study.
The good news is that if you give up, the risk drops quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is the result of a long-term study by an international team of researchers, including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared with non-smokers, smokers had a 2.5 to 3.6 times higher risk of premature tooth loss.
The scientists observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth decay are cavities and inflammation of the gums, the DIfE stresses.
Smoking is a risk factor for this periodontal disease, the authors stress.
The association between smoking and tooth loss is therefore attributed to more frequent tooth inflammation in smokers.
It is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of caries.
But those who quit could reduce their risk in a short time, the researchers write in the Journal of Dental Research.
However, it could take more than a decade for the risk to fall back to the level of non-smokers, explained first author Thomas Dietrich of Birmingham University in England.
"Smoking shortens life", said DIfE study director Heiner Boeing, "you have to convince people to quit smoking".
Not smoking is good for the lungs and vessels and, according to our findings, also leads to good dental health into old age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years is affected by toothlessness, the DIfE reported.
Previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth decay.
The new long-term study supports the findings.
Archaeologists find remains from the Late Antiquity on the Rhine River near Cologne
For the first time archaeological finds have been made in Cologne on the right bank of the Rhine.
Near the site of the new Rhine Boulevard, archaeologists at the Roman-German Museum have unearthed skeletons and remains of historic buildings, museum director Marcus Trier said Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine, historians have been searching for so-called landmarks.
The museum is always used for all construction projects in the Cologne district as a specialist centre for the care of archaeological floor paintings.
In the third phase of the construction of the Rhine Boulevard, archaeologists have now found.
The documentation of the site was already known, and in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century a church were built on the site, Trier explained.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with some 350 graves was discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Boy caught in a freight train
After a young woman was killed in a train accident at the train station in Linder, the German police are asking the people for help.
Early Wednesday morning, at about 1:40 a.m., the woman was crossing the track from the railway station building and was picked up by a freight train coming from the Mönchengladbach.
The train was seized and she sustained serious injuries, according to the Federal Police.
She was treated on the spot and taken to a hospital by paramedics.
The investigating officer has no information on the reason for the young woman's nightly crossing.
The incident may have been witnessed or residents heard acoustic perceptions.
Inquiry is open to residents or passersby of Linderner Bahn, Brickbakerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffartherstraße (L364).
Information on the cause of the accident can be obtained from the Federal Police's toll-free hotline, 0800/6888000 or any other police service.
The European Commission proposes a new court in a dispute over TTIP
To ease the dispute over the planned TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a major reform of the current arbitration system.
The disputed private arbitration bodies for disputes between companies and States are therefore to be replaced by a more transparent system which is significantly more traditional in its functioning.
"We want to create a system that citizens trust", said Commissioner Cecilia Malmström at the presentation.
Sweden intends to include the proposal in the free trade talks with the United States as a European negotiating position.
The German government announced support.
TTIP is intended to create the world's largest free trade zone with 800 million people.
The reform plans for the current arbitration proceedings specifically provide for the joint selection of independent judges by the EU and the US for a new investment court.
They are to be equally drawn from the EU, the USA and third countries.
The first time a second instance is also envisaged.
It would allow you to appeal against judgments.
Until now, the parties had agreed to arbitrators, whose judgments could not be challenged.
In the discussion of the past months, it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, Malmström commented.
In the long term, she says she wants to work for an International Investment Court.
For example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be settled there.
The investor-state dispute settlement procedure (ISDS) which is required by large companies is considered one of the main reasons for the strong resistance in Europe to TTIP.
Traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice through which companies can sue for damages to taxpayers, repeal national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In initial opinions, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact called the EU Commission's proposals inadequate.
The main criticism was that they were not to apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
The German Economic Secretary Matthias Machnig (SPD) called the plans a major step forward.
The Commission takes into account the key points of the reform, which were drawn up by the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel, in the spring with other EU trade ministers.
The old system of private arbitration is off the table.
The French government also welcomed Malmström's plans.
The European Business Association BusinessEurope warned against limiting the possibilities of business complaints by too many new rules.
It said that this would be particularly disadvantageous for small and mediumsized enterprises.
On Wednesday, it was still unclear when negotiations on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) free trade agreement could be concluded.
The negotiations have been going on since mid-2013.
The issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the USA.
The agreement was originally to be framed by the end of this year.
This date is no longer valid.
Delightful folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens was on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (now Luxor).
Next to it is a flip-card on which the shy folk singer has painted the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with a felt pen.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost touched by Stevens' speech.
He tells stories based on various places, which he repeatedly records on the map, about which his meticulous and delicately arranged songs tell.
Where they came from and what it looks like there, in his homeland.
Ever since, Stevens has proven himself to be a wonderfully creative lunatic.
With the 2003 release of their third album, Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State, they have a cleverly composed sound that harmoniously blends with American folk of the late '60s, but can drift into a very opulent atmosphere at any time.
The rumor is that "Michigan" is the first in a planned series, with each of the 50 states singing in succession.
But as early as 2004 and in the Rhineland, Seven Swans has already been released, breaking certain expectations.
Downsized, Stevens is performing here.
He's got to play the guitar and the banjo.
A year later, the New York musician returns to the series.
"Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise") is a widely acclaimed masterpiece.
It's full of ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album entered the US Billboard charts and is not missing from any of the year's best lists of influential music media.
After extremely productive experiments, Stevens then uses a very large amount of electronic transcripts on "The Age of Adz" (2010).
This sixth proper studio album is still broadly orchestrated, but is carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall.
As the smaller clubs rise, the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of neon ribbons and large fluorescent stage decor.
Sufjan Stevens is currently touring Germany as part of a five-piece band.
In the dark hamburger more!
He is the main theatre presenter of the Carrie & Lowell series, which has been running since March.
Although almost 2,000 guests are now confined to their chairs, Stevens, who has matured considerably, is returning to intimacy and folk.
Without a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians play through the widely enriched album.
The audience says the lecture is "more opulent" and can be used to "basically throw away the record".
Stevens, who is humble, thanks for the addition, plays a few older songs acoustically and finally bends down to a roaring applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time has been eagerly awaited.
The new Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is due to make his debut at the prime minister's debate and compete for the first time with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, with his performance likely to be closely monitored by the media and by Labour MPs.
He called for "less theater and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination of Mr Corbyn's leadership, as it will come after his appointment to the Shadow Cabinet and after his speech at the TUC Annual Meeting on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour chairman's decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the national anthem at a commemoration ceremony marking the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked criticism from a number of Tory MPs and has been the focus of several headline stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has drawn attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "stood in respectful silence" and acknowledged the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the air battle for England".
But a member of Mr Corbyn's Shadow Cabinet, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight programme that he advised the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve on Mr Corbyn's senior team, citing differences in economics, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as leader.
The BBC's political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences are also "stacking up" within Labour, following Mr Corbyn's statements on the position on the European Union and the limitation of winning.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour was proposing changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether.
Hours later Mr Smith, the Shadow Labour and Pensions Minister, said the party was "very clear" that it was only against the government's plans to lower the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour chairman to face David Cameron across the dispatch box in Parliament in the last decade since he became Tory leader.
The Labour leader, who promised a different policy approach, says he has crowd-sourced ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the prime minister's questioning is too confrontational and that he will refrain from both "strike-readyness" and fighting with the counter-attacks and has instead decided to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges faced by young people.
Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the Shadow Economy Minister, will represent him if he does not attend - for example, if Mr Cameron is abroad.
He also raised the idea that other colleagues would occasionally speak and that he had approached John Bercow, the speaker of the House, to discuss the problem.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from politics in the style of a "Kasperle theater", which is often linked to the prime minister's questioning session, but a few years later he admitted he failed in it.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, the prime minister's question mark has been seen as the most important barometer of a leader's judgment and leadership in the House of Commons and his standing among his parliamentary colleagues, although critics have argued that it has become a caricature and needs far-reaching reforms.
Shooting in Joburg: Homeless youth trained to be photographers
The city centre of Johannesburg is a tough place to be when you're homeless.
But a group of former street children found a way to learn a skill and earn a living.
I Was Shot in Joburg is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youth how to take pictures of their surroundings and make a profit from them.
BBC News met one of the first graduates of the project.

The pound rises due to accelerated wage growth in the UK
The pound rose sharply, according to data showing a rise in UK wage growth, and the FTSE 100 was also raised by the SABMiller bid target.
Between May and July, profit without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
This percentage was the fastest since 2009 and provided estimates of when interest rates increased.
The pound rose by more than 1% against the dollar to $1,5505 and climbed to 0.84% against the euro to €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed with a 1.49% increase to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding stock on the market and made a 20% jump after the takeover bid from rival AB InBev.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world, bringing together brands like Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were up 0.9%, according to encouraging news from luxury goods rival group Richemont.
Richmond's latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - are again showing growth.
Glencore shares rose 5 percent after the miner said he raised $2.5 billion through a stock sale as part of his debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest losers in the index, falling 4.3 percent after Goldman Sachs rated the company "for sale".
JD Sports increased by 3.1%, after the sportswear company reported a pre-tax profit of 46.6 million for the half year.
The head of JD Sports says higher wages are jeopardizing expansion.
JD Sports CEO Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers".
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labor costs at his company, he says.
The cost could be on top of JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, and that could mean fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: on Bieber's expedition to Berlin
Justin Bieber, the big star.
21 year old, a handmaid with a top-flight haircut.
The guy with the platinum blonde hair weighs 100 million euros.
It's more than that.
Monsieur Bieber is currently in Berlin.
And the U17 generation is going crazy.
It's like Victoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
It's not bad.
Hundreds of fans were with Justin yesterday.
Including Ewa and Victoria from Poland.
But since 7 a.m., the Polyn has been sitting on the cold stone slabs in front of the luxury hotel in Berlin on Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber Building: This is where your idol lives, whose posters have been hanging in Stettin since Monday night.
The suite where the Canadian singer lives costs the same amount a day as her mom Ewa earns in six months.
If you ever do.
She says, "Actually, my Victoria should be in the 10th grade in high school".
"I'm fulfilling her dream".
Schooling?
Who's itching?
Not the fans.
Not even Bieber himself.
He took care of it anyway.
He's got three million dollars for the Super Bowl commercials, a two-year deal with an anti-pickle company, and he's been pouring a lot of, a lot of dollars into Bieber's account.
And every doll that looks like him and goes over the counter, Bieber casts too.
When Justin Bieber drinks coffee, you're standing at the window.
He's said to have taken more than 100 million.
Some say the hype went too far.
Others emphasize that Bieber is finally in the US and UK with his new single "What do you mean?" at No. 1.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is due in November, doesn't care about the many zeros at first.
At least he does.
Pegida poster brings Lebanese to the potato-doner idea
Potatoes or donuts?
It is both possible - potato dough, developed by Oldenburg diner owner Hani Alhay.
Inspired by the saying "Potato instead of Donuts" on a Pegida poster, Alhay put potatoes and meat together on a top.
He was inspired by a poster at a Pegida demonstration that read "Potatoes instead of Donuts", which he had seen on television.
Since then, his shop has been running a barbecue with meat and potatoes.
"This is a stomach multiculture", Alhay says.
The idea has now been registered with the Lebanese Patent Office in Munich.
It has been recently protected as a pattern for use there, according to the Authority.
Alhay is not willing to reveal how much meat and how many potatoes the snack contains.
He thinks, "It tastes even better together".
The culinary international understanding is also well received by its customers.
Metcash is launching a ground-breaking campaign to combat Aldi-infection
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA branches from an Aldi raid in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a ground-based campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and social media marketing, as well as events like the Adelaide Show.
IGA dealers and suppliers are jumping on board, with brands like ice cream maker Simmo from Dunsborough, who distributes samples to IGA stores and shopkeepers selling discounted tickets to loyal customers for the South Australian Football League.
Metcash is expected to release further details of its defence strategy on 29 September, when the wholesaler for food, alcohol and equipment runs its annual Investor Strategy Day.
There's a lot at stake, as South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Metcash's IGA charging stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the Eastern states.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial, and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in the eastern states.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that 12 months after opening its first markets, Aldi will take away about five percent of the food market in these two states and take away sales from all existing players, but mostly independent retailers.
According to a report published this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in annual sales and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and will generate sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and grocery business and in the quantities on Metcash's high fixed cost basis could cost Metcash around $13 million in profit before interest and taxes, Mr Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the Eastern countries, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcash's food and food sales will decline 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and will reduce market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the chief fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, told a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash is likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash declined to comment publicly on Mr. Douglass's comments.
But it's been speculated that a Metcash board member contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18% to 14% since 2010, and revenue from Metcash's food and grocery business, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43% since 2012, reflecting the operational debt reduction while also putting pressure on revenue and margins.
However, the wholesaler is fighting back, investing more than $150 million to match sales prices with Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week, and to improve IGA retailers' ability to improve their stores by providing faster-growing fresh food and a better choice of private label food.
Metcash's chief executive Ian Morrice says that the price adjustments and store cleanup programs will be added to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the president of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves more praise than criticism for his own behavior, according to Australian Tennis Association president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, who is repeatedly referred to as "Special Ks", came to the limelight after Kyrgios' infamous fight with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifying game in Cincinnati shortly thereafter, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison were separated twice by the referee, with Harrison shouting, "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten the child".
While he was last seen smashing a tennis bat after a cramp foiled a potential US Open win by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was steadfastly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for second place in singles behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.
"One thing I'm pretty sure about is the fact that in my opinion Thanasi was a little drawn into the fight", Healy said.
He broke a bat when he lost to a cramp at the US Open, but he's not the first player to break a bat out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he's not proud of it.
But, really, he's been doing extremely well at the US Open, even under the pretty provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of credit.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little too harshly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits in the team and so on, he's never had a problem with the other players, he's respected in the dressing room, he's trained hard, he's in good shape, he's a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged by his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account in the important preliminary decision that begins on Friday, and he describes the "joint decision" as the right one for all, but he assures the Canberra man that he will return to the team as a permanent part of the long-term".
"First, we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversy around [Kyrgios]", Healy said.
And I think Nick has made a very quick climb, which people like Federer and Murray have pointed out, and he's getting in the public eye, and he's made some bad mistakes and he deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to make him understand the consequences of his actions.
European refugee crisis: Hungary declares a state of emergency, closes the border, withholds refugees
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday, arresting all those who tried to enter the country illegally, all with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos ensued at the border as hundreds of migrants gathered in a no man's land and Serbian officials reacted with indignation.
People fleeing violence were trapped for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two checkpoints of the countries and built tents and settled there.
But frustrations increased.
As a police helicopter floated over them, the migrants chanted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at the Hungarian police.
Some withdrew food and water in protest.
Serbia's foreign minister said it was "unacceptable" that migrants from Hungary would be sent back while more and more were arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not collateral damage.
In the coming days, talks must take place with Brussels and other countries", Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The turmoil at the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after a controversial meeting in Brussels failed to agree on a common immigration policy.
However, the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in Italy and Greece, and expressed hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached to allow EU countries to take in another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special European Union summit on Tuesday to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, did not put its hopes on any immediate action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The state of emergency declared on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more power to deal with the crisis, allowing them to block roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Hungary's foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, said that his country also plans to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country after it has finished a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners were used in the race to build the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a significant bottleneck and entry point into the European Union for many Syrian and other Middle Eastern war refugees.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most of the arrivals are economic refugees seeking a better life, not war refugees entitled to protection - a view that is in stark contrast to other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, make it a crime to cross the border or to occupy the four-meter (13 foot) high fence that the government had built along the southern border with Serbia.
"Due to the situation created by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares a state of emergency", government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We are very clear that illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament has yet to approve the military's deployment, which is expected next week, but Associated Press reporters have been seeing heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs at the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban's national security adviser, said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border, with 15 others already entering the country deeper.
They come over by damaging the fence, they're now in police custody and are charged with committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are working on repairing the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a barbed-wire train arrived to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process people's data and pressed a crowd to infiltrate it.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands stayed out.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway link between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they could enter Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders in the national poll halved
Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-digit lead in the Democratic nomination race at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins her down.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primary (58 percent earlier), while Sanders is second with 27 percent (up 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, receives support from 15 percent of Democratic voters in the primary.
More than five months before the primary election, most Democratic voters say it's too early to say they're determined which candidates they'll support.
But Clinton's supporters are more consistent in their election than the other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll, Clinton has lost to a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has made some gains.
Clinton has a big lead among women and moderates, but those leaps have been diminishing.
Your support for the men has dropped sharply, and Sanders is only five points behind.
Clinton's advantage over Democratic voters under 50 has faded, and she and Sanders are now on par.
Clinton, however, still has a big lead among the older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders with a two-digit lead on the Liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point lead on that group.
About half of the Democratic voters in the primary statewide say they would be enthusiastic about supporting Clinton if she were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would support her just because she's the candidate.
Six percent would not support them.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her.
The views are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would be enthusiastic about supporting her.
While 48 percent of Democratic voters in the primary say they are enthusiastically supporting Clinton, fewer Republican voters say so about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the belief that it's time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she's the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also mention her connection to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of workers' rights and the right to vote is also cited.
As the vice president throws a potential for the presidency into the balance sheet, 57 percent of the Democratic primary voters want to see him in the race - although a third believe he shouldn't.
When Democratic voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is on top.
More than half of Clinton's supporters say Biden would be their second choice far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead will increase from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the election; however, that number has dropped by 78 percent in the past month.
Biden is by far second in this measurement, but the percentage who consider him the "most eligible" has risen.
Yet when asked what is more important to a candidate, Democratic voters ask questions about eligibility.
Like last month, not a single Democratic or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable to these voters in the primary.
Democratic or potential candidates are performing well in some important features of their party's primary electorate.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership skills.
Biden is the best candidate for honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters don't believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don't think so.
Democratic voters in the primary generally also view Clinton, Sanders and Biden as ideologically in line with their views.
In all these measurements, about a quarter of the Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
Since questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and server during her tenure as Secretary of State continue to be raised, most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her statement on the matter and say it has not affected their views overall.
But it's a different story in the American public at large.
Half of Americans are now unhappy with their statement, while only about a third are.
Public opinion on this issue was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the email controversy had no effect on their general views of Clinton, although 36 percent said their views of her had worsened.
It's mostly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say their views of Clinton have gotten worse.
Although Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by her party's voters, this remains a problem for her among registered voters overall: Only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May.
62 percent of eligible voters do not consider them an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of eligible voters across the country also consider Trump to be dishonest and untrustworthy.
But Clinton and Trump get good grades when they lead.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush are the best at honesty.
A majority of people think Sanders is more honest, but like Carson, many people don't think he's right.
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primary election is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is closely behind Donald Trump in a nationwide poll
Ben Carson is closely behind Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll.
The two candidates now have half the voter support in the new poll, and the others are losing dramatically.
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers nationwide, rising from 23 percent in the last CBS poll conducted before the Fox News debate last month to 27 percent in Tuesday's poll.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% over the same period.
The poll also found that Carson is well-liked by demographic groups and outperforms Trump by higher education among Republican voters.
The rest of the field, except for Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has been defeated by Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen the lowest, from 10% support last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place with 6 percent.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 people of Republican voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6%, and was conducted in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week shows Carson is rising in the polls -- he ends up with 19 percent support for the Republicans, behind Trump with 32 percent support.
The most recent ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed Trump clearly ahead of Carson.
Looking at a Carson rising last week, Trump found some sideways for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy", Trump said last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees Celsius.
Even if the peak values are measured only in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean Sea is enough for those who go on a swimming holiday to find warm water.
A swim in the North Sea or Baltic Sea at a maximum of 17 degrees is likely to be a rather brief pleasure.
Some are no longer going to sea: the water in the North and Baltic Seas is at its highest this week, the German Weather Service (DWD) reports.
The Mediterranean, on the other hand, continues to offer bathing temperatures: in the east, it even reaches 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic it's 25 degrees, in France it's 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt is at 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood are blamed for the death of a Baruch College freshman
Nearly two years after a student died during a harrowing ritual at a student association in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, five people are being charged with murder.
Members of the New York City Baruch College Pi Delta Psi fraternity brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an induction ceremony in September 2013 and delayed his transportation to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
Officials said he was blindfolded with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and repeatedly attacked as he tried to cross a frozen field to a target.
Mr. Deng finally complained of headaches, then he fell unconscious.
The Pi Delta Psi fraternity did not call 911 after Deng fainted and reportedly waited an hour before taking him to a hospital, police said.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the Brotherhood, for advice, Chief of Police Chris Wagner said at a news conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide utensils and put the brotherhood's welfare above that of Michael Deng", said Chief Wagner.
He could not be revived, and he died the next morning of his injuries.
According to an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly injured in the head, torso and thigh with blunt force.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the bullying of the fraternity, and at least one student has died from the bullying every year since 1970", said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, in a statement.
The Community and its Members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is very important.
A county grand jury of Monroe recommended a charge of third-degree murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr Meng, are also charged with aggravated assault and the formation of a criminal association.
"We want to hold the people involved accountable, but if there is an organization that - officially or unofficially - has sanctioned this, we will hold them accountable", Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the fraternity, and the national fraternity has revoked its membership in the local group.
That's what's gonna happen when the Fed raises interest rates.
An interest rate hike will come, and the house will shake, yields on bonds will rise, and the economy will slip into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long this will take and how long it will last.
In particular, history provides little guidance for the economy.
A recession occurred within 11 months of the first rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve's aggressiveness in raising interest rates is often, if not always, a factor in how the economy and financial institutions respond.
Therefore, US central bank representatives have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when they start raising interest rates but rather on the period needed for normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
However, in the end, market participants might find that the whole excitement about a rate hike may have been exaggerated.
"The first Fed increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the 'cheap money' era", said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a statement to clients.
In contrast, we do not expect the US interest rates to return to normal levels gradually, but still to too low levels to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
But that doesn't mean there won't be any impact.
Here's a look at how some sectors of the economy might react based on historical trends:
As the market saw last month, anticipating interest rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.
Once the increase comes, the impact is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency for asset yields to strangle 12 to 24 months after the first raise, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy again", Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what happens after Fed interest rate hikes.
More specifically, the market has been mostly upward-trending over the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate hikes, fairly flat in the 250 days afterwards (average profit of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return over the past six cycles of 14.4 percent according to a recent analysis published by Bob Doll, chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, at Barron's.
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the return begins to decline.
Recessions are a fact of life, but interest rate increases often promote them.
In the current case, the Fed is faced with some conditions that did not exist before and could accelerate a recession.
It is extremely noteworthy that the GDP will be close to its lowest point when the Fed raises interest rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 have only doubled nominal GDP below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect this to continue, and only 1.5 percent for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Interest rates rise in such a fragile economic environment could be risky and raise the question of whether "it is different this time", Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been preparing for a Fed rate hike all year, and all eyes were on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase at this meeting, futures trading only gives a 25 percent probability.
"In our study, all the growth cycles from 1950 to the present have been in a super-cycle with increasing GDP momentum, overshadowing pre-recession highs very quickly after the start of recovery", the report says.
In contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed period.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and so far it's been 74 months.
Fixed income was also volatile as the market anticipates interest rate increases and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on stocks when they change their strategic course.
In the case of loans, yields appear to change direction as soon as the first increase/decline occurs in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, the bond yields fall immediately, Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will cause yields between longer and shorter borrowings to shrink and lead to a flattening of the curve.
High-interest bonds often yield better returns in such a climate, although "we are still cautious about expecting higher returns", said Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones says, markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of stricter monetary policy", she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, yield curve is flatter, credit margins have expanded and volatility has increased - all of which are characteristics of the market as the Fed tights its strategy.
In general, companies that do most of their business in the United States will benefit from higher interest rates and more attractive local products.
Multinational companies with high debt will be worse off as a rising dollar makes their products and financing of their debt more expensive on the global market.
"History shows that 'quality' stocks tend to respond very positively three months after an initial rate hike", Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for customers.
Firms with strong balance sheets outperformed weak firms by an average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high returns on capital and low volatility in their shares also outperformed their lower-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt is becoming a big problem.
Companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside of pure equity, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see gains from higher returns, even if experts differ on how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
The Conservative MP criticised the broadcaster for its "dumbing down"
He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying they were just imitating The Brits.
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins responded to The Voice and said it was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 is "turning" into Classic FM, claims a leading MP and raises new pressure on the station to prove it is doing something that the private broadcasters are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public service broadcaster was "stupid" and increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word 'dumb' - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM", he said.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which began last year, seem to be simply under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something else -- these are two spontaneous examples where you're actually just imitating what's already on the market", Mr Bingham said.
BBC Director-General rejected the allegations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it came to live music and public education.
What I learn from Radio 3 I will learn about classical music nowhere else.
And there's a commitment to live music and to making music that's really unmatched.
"And I think the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works is really important", he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that more work needs to be done to engage the public than it has in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3 was not the only BBC production to be fired during the Culture, Media and Sport Selection Committee hearing over its attempts to kick-start its commercial rivals.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show, which was bought by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated £22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it's not original and not particularly striking?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - be produced "in a special BBC way".
He added that he hopes the company will "find a hit from our own stable" the next time it launches an entertainment series.
However, he refused to exclude the ordering of further series of The Voice in the future or to spend fee-paying money for other entertainment formats.
Internet traffic rose the slowest in August and Black Friday may be responsible
In the first three months of 2015, there was a seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month was the lowest since records began in 2000.
Online sales increased three years ago with the use of mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe that Black Friday in November has slowed spending
For over a decade, virtual shopping has been booming, and many of Britain's main shopping streets have become ghost towns.
But experts say there are now signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure for August represented the lowest growth since records began in 2000, with an increase of only 5 per cent from the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015.
"If you look at the growth rates for the past few years and go down to 2000, that's the way things have been over time", Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG Sales Index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started shopping with their phones.
It meant more people could shop online and people could do it in different environments, like at home on the couch.
But now that it's commuting, we may see growth slowing down.
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is cited as a reason for the decline in sales.
Experts believe that buyers will hold back their purchases before this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, the average number of shoppers went around their computers five times to make their deals, and some retailers' websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when buyers were fighting over bargains, could deter buyers from shopping.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that of the £5 spent, just over £1 was spent online.
For some products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made through online shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the inner-city fashion chains.
Muslims bury dead in Mecca in the crane crash - Bin Laden's family sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the streets of Mecca at the first funerals
Saudi Arabia blames the collapse of the massive Saudi bin Laden group
The health ministry said that in addition, a total of 394 people were injured after the crane collapsed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered as 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those killed when a crane collapsed at Mecca's Grand Mosque.
Mourners, mostly dressed in white, filled the aisle to pay their respects as the first of the dead made their final journey to Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
The mourning procession passed at the Holy Place, where just days earlier a crane had fallen through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the prayers.
The bodies were released for burial when the Saudi king imposed a sanction on the bin Laden family's construction company over the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 Beters who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane fell.
Mr. Akram was with his parents before the start of the annual Hajj in the Great Mosque.
Saudi officials have already made a firm commitment that the Hajj will continue to Mecca with thousands continuing to come to the city.
Today King Salman said the Bin Laden group should not have left the arm of the crane standing when it was not being used.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said the Bin Laden group was co-responsible for the collapse.
The English-language service of the news agency did not report this detail but said that the company's management was prohibited from traveling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the collapse of the crane, which crashed into a courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before the Hajj, which is later this month.
The Bin Laden Group has not issued any statement on the collapse of the Krans and its representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal Decree also blamed the group for not taking up current security measures and for not cooperating with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca's Grand Mosque as part of a massive construction project led by the Bin Laden Group.
The bin Laden family has been linked to the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is taking on larger construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a son of a rebel who was expropriated by the family in the 1990s.
The crane collapsed amidst strong winds and rain, just days before millions arrived in the kingdom for the pilgrimage required at least once in every healthy Muslim's life.
Officials said 158 people are staying in the hospital.
Government officials ordered 1 million rials (£174,000) to be paid to the families of the dead and the same amount to the permanent wounded.
Other injured people will receive half of that amount.
B&Q boss says the time for cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
British workers are increasingly employed, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has been rising steadily
This will lead to the opening of 200 more screw-fix stores targeting artisans.
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q outlets nationwide.
By Rupert Steiner, City chief correspondent for the Daily Mail
It is claimed that the British put down their hammers and brushes in favour of the use of skilled Eastern European craftsmen who do the work in their homes
If you can handle wall painting skillfully with a hammer or a brush, you seem to be in the minority these days.
Because Britons are increasingly hiring craftsmen to do home improvement jobs in their homes, says the head of the company behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, new Managing Director of Kingfisher, which owns the construction market chain, said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe offering services at low prices had now been overcome.
Kingfisher therefore plans to open 200 more craft-oriented screwfix shops and close 60 B&Q outlets.
Mrs. Laury said she wanted to employ more women in B&Q shops because eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store are made by women.
At the moment, the men are the most important among the employees.
She said it was necessary to address the growing demographic trends, which have more single-family households, which are undergoing more renovations than in the past.
Mrs. Laury said: "There are still a majority of men working in our branches.
We must move this closer to a balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women, with 80 percent of the decisions about buying items made by women.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, one of only five women to lead a UK company listed in the FTSE100 Index, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in senior positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has exactly 50 percent of the team of women, including its CEO and CFO.
Mrs Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It wasn't hard to find good women for our supervisory board.
Kingfisher reported a decline in half-year earnings and sales after the group shouldered the cost of closing the stores.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new stores.
Officials of Aich/Dob for breach of trust
At the Klagenfurt Regional Court, two officials of the Austrian Volleyball Vice-Champions Aich/Dob were held on Wednesday to account for infidelity and tax evasion.
The defendants pleaded not guilty.
One of them had also been charged with abuse of office.
He was acquitted of the charge in May.
The current trial has been postponed.
According to the Prosecutor General Robert Riffel, the preliminary investigation revealed that the defendants used funds from the association accounts they were allowed to dispose of for their functions for private purposes between 2006 and 2011.
He estimates the damage at around 400,000 euros.
The sports officials are also charged with financial crimes.
This fact was rejected by the chairman of the Opening Council, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It is to be negotiated at a later date.
The defence alleged that the association had never suffered a property disadvantage.
The sports officials had only calculated expenses and had paid off the debts of the sports club for which they had worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the liabilities amounted to around 600,000 shillings (approximately EUR 44,000) in 2001.
"We were faced with the situation: Should we continue to run the club or should we close it down?" said one of the defendants, a senior financial inspector at the Bread Office.
He then decided to take up this task with his colleague and co-defendant.
With all the risks.
"We have raised money, we have deposited our life insurance as collateral in the bank", he said in the agreement.
The association has agreed that they can manage the money freely, but that they cannot be indebted.
The Commission also decided to pay the costs retroactively until 1991, if the financial success was appropriate.
Therefore, part of the cost of the compensation was not paid until years later, since 2003, when there was a surplus in the account.
The former Obmann explained the process.
The accounts and savings books were jointly managed by the two defendants, the second defendant said.
The judge asked why the payouts had not been disclosed to the association in detail.
The association was not interested in the details of the financial disclosure, the answer being that only debt relief was important.
In 2011, when an official was investigated for abuse of office, an amount of EUR 120,000 was transferred to the association's account.
The defendants claimed that they were reservations.
This security account was in the name of the second defendant and according to his statement was not known to the association.
"Why?" the judge wanted to know.
The respondent did not know the answer for a long time.
Then he finally said he thought it was the best thing for the club.
If anything had happened to him, no one would have known about this money, the prosecutor put it in the room.
The official justified that the co-defendant had been informed.
This transfer was formulated as 'reimbursement'.
Why compensation? The judge and the prosecutor wanted to know.
The first defendant stated that he disagreed with this wording because the association was never harmed.
But what do I do when the lawyer says, "You're all out of your hair with this?"
"Am I a lawyer?" he asked.
The official also said that he never received a penny of his salary, but only paid for miles and diets.
He charged the association €1,000 a month for diets, but the actual cost was much higher, he added.
The defendants could not present any accurate documents for the early years.
They explained that these were no longer kept after an operational test in which everything was deemed to be correct.
The second defendant had also been paid a mile.
All the transactions were made in cash, he had to drive from his place of residence, Völkermarkt, to the bank in Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The main hearing will continue on 23 September with the questioning of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard is cutting another 30,000 jobs.
In addition to the three-year staffing cut, the computer giant will cut more jobs as the company splits.
The job losses at US computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) are endless.
The US technology group plans to reduce its corporate customer service from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring.
The company said Tuesday that this would save $2.7 billion ($2.4 billion).
The move will lead to a special burden of some $2.7 billion, which will be incurred from the fourth quarter.
The three-year layoff of 55,000 jobs is not yet complete.
HP employed around 302,000 people at the end of the 2013/14 financial year.
After the stock market, Hewlett-Packard's stock fell 2.3 percent.
The Palo Alto, California, printer-based group is currently divided: the computer and printing business is to be consolidated into a new society this year - separated from the more promising areas of computer servers and data storage for companies and other services.
Both business units are to be listed on the stock exchange.
The second largest PC manufacturer in the world, after Lenovo, was recently hit by disappointing PC sales and weaker demand from corporate customers for its services.
In the third quarter ended July, PC and printer sales fell by 11.5%.
Sales fell 8 percent to nearly $25.4 billion.
This is a decrease in revenues in 15 of the 16 quarters.
HP is responding to the changes in the industry with a split and massive job losses.
The 76-year-old company, led by Meg Whitman, has only reacted late to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and doing more and more online business.
Whitman's restructuring plans foresee the total reduction of some 55,000 jobs.
Conflict: majority supporting the anti-IS training mission
However, the direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would be rejected by the majority: 54% opposed and 35% agreed.
That other states are carrying out airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive.
24% are against intervening in the conflict.
51 percent of respondents rejected cooperation with Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad, 20 percent would support it.
29 percent couldn't decide.
Car: Second press day at the 66th IAA
The main focus of the exhibition will be connected, self-driving cars and electric mobility until 27 September.
After two days of press, German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Automobile Exhibition on Thursday, under the theme "Mobility connects".
The general public can visit the IAA from Saturday.
The organisers of the VDA Motor Association expect about 900 000 visitors, as they did two years ago.
Röszke: Outbreak of violence at the Serbian-Hungarian border
Hungarian police have used tear gas and water sprayers at the Serbian border near Röszke against several hundred displaced people.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border checkpoint.
He reported by phone:
A group of refugees crossed the border.
A police line had formed behind them and a water thrower was standing behind them.
40 to 50 refugees began throwing stones, sticks and plastic bottles at the officials.
The officials initially used pepper spray continuously.
Then the police used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was sprayed on the refugees.
That dissolved the group.
The refugees have now retreated a little while waiting.
A pregnant woman who was apparently injured was taken out of the area.
Children who had inhaled tear gas were screaming.
Other refugees were drowning and suffering from shortness of breath.
Serbian police spokesmen also suffered injuries from the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time of the interest rate decision for the US central bank
The world is watching as the U.S. Central Bank meets every two days, Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether or not interest rates will be raised for the first time in nearly a decade.
A survey of 80 economists interviewed by Reuters found that a little over half, who last week thought the Fed would do this, now think the Fed will hold on a little longer and keep interest rates at their current level of 0 to 0.25 percent.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Fed set interest rates to zero.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a major central bank may leave the zero range and start a process of normalizing interest rates", said Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is at a relatively good level, trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet, and they only generate low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook on global conditions.
It has warned markets to adjust to an increase, but the signs suggest that the odds are good against such a move.
The decision is to be announced at 8 p.m. on Thursday.
Death row at Delta State University left an apology note
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before shooting and killing his colleague later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying he was "in pain" about the first murder and wanted "he could undo it", authorities announced Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a professor of geography and social science education at Delta State University, called the emergency number at about 10:00 a.m. on Monday morning.
He said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the emergency room officer that the police should send officers to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that there was a "sweet dog" in the house, but he "won't bother anyone", but he'll probably be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he didn't give it.
Lamb didn't give an explanation for his shootings.
When police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, that said, "I'm so sorry, I wish I could reverse it.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me".
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before finally taking his own life on Monday night when police surrounded him.
University president William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's idea".
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed Prentiss had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said Tuesday that there was "no information, no evidence" of a "triangle relationship".
Prentiss was described as a "good person" by Shawn O'Steen, who stated that they had been married for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who's 19 and she's "down in the gutter".
He said Prentiss was her daughter's "absolutely best friend".
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said Prentiss, who owned a dog named Lightning, had been seeing Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people", Knowles said.
Police said Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them he wasn't going to jail.
When police caught him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car to the side, ran away on foot, ran into the woods, and shot himself.
Lamb received a doctorate from Delta State University in the spring of 2015, according to his resume on the university's website.
Stars who lost their lucky charm
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001, he battled leukemia, and in 2009, he lost his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
The actor is also said to be struggling with drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of drug possession.
All of this is certainly a tribute to him.
Eurowings: Lufthansa is rebuilding the Group
Lufthansa is planning a major restructuring of the group.
Half a billion euros a year is what Lufthansa wants to save by having a better organisation alone.
150 of the world's 1,000 executives will lose their jobs.
The pilot union is still in negotiations.
Lufthansa is restructuring its corporate structure and is evaluating its subsidiary Eurowings.
The airline announced on Wednesday that the target of the restructuring is a revenue contribution of around EUR 500 million per year from cost and profit synergies.
In particular, there will be no longer any board of directors for the passenger business at Lufthansa.
The low-cost airline Eurowings should be developed as independently as possible.
In the management team of Chief Carsten Spohr, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the future.
The new name highlights the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group intends to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
Until now, the organization of the 120,000 employees of a strong company was complex.
The airlines operated under the umbrella of Passage Airline Group, which accounts for three quarters of the annual turnover of EUR 30 billion.
New negotiations with pilots
The negotiations with the Cockpit Pilots' Association (VC) are due to resume after the court-ordered strike on Thursday.
The union told me.
The subject of the talks is to be the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to achieve viable results as soon as possible "in a year with a forecasted record result".
The conflict between the union and the airline has led to various strikes in recent months.
The background is the "Wings" savings concept, which is the pilot's transitional supply.
It provides that Lufthansa will extend routes to the group's own low-cost line Eurowings in order to fight its competitors.

Luke Shaw of Manchester United can 't play for months due to a double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture to his right leg in the Champions League defeat to Manchester United at PSV Eindhoven.
While this made the left-sided defender cry and will keep him out of the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up hope that Shaw can play again this season.
The injury was caused by a reckless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital".
He's being moved tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated on in Manchester.
It's terrible -- a kid who comes to Manchester United at 18, he's having a really hard time, and then he's playing fantastic, and then this happens.
He was wearing an oxygen mask in the locker room.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it takes six months, and he's not playing in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the imposition of an eleven-meter mark.
The referee, Nicola Rizzoli, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee had made a mistake.
You can judge for yourself when I say a meter and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account read, "Thank you all for your messages. Words cannot describe how broken I am, my path to recovery is now beginning, I'm coming back stronger".
Related: Manchester United suffer the loss of Luke Shaw in the defeat at PSV
The England defender has an additional incentive to recover by June next with the European Championship in France.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said, "It's a very serious injury".
When a player with this kind of injury leaves the court, everyone is very sad about it.
It's never our players' intention to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg when Mexico played Van Gaal's Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's doing very hard because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and if you hear it's a very bad injury, it's not good", Cocu said.
It was impossible for me to see the moment.
All I could see was the ball moving in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched it, but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said, "I know how it feels, I know how hard this can be.
I feel very bad about it.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after a foul game by Chris Smalling.
I'm sure David Cameron knows the Lorax better.
It's a thing all parents soon learn: If your child loves a book, it won't be long before you almost memorize it.
Unless you might be David Cameron.
When asked by a childcare system provider to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose The Lorax, Dr. Seuss' environmental fable published in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a post on the SuperCamps website, and continues: "Fun, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it's a book I love to read to my children, because it always seems to have a picture or message that we've missed so far".
All good, except that the next paragraph, where Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book, instead shows a content entry from the 2012 film version that added new characters and details to expand the fairly short original text.
"Amid the walled city of Thneedville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree", reads the account.
As if that wasn't suspicious enough, Cameron's text reads in part like the summary of the Lorax film, which is presented on the Internet Movie Database website, and begins: "In the walled city of Thneedville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams".
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so unfamiliar with the plot of the book. Here an unnamed boy hears the local environment being devastated by the greedy, tree-throwing, thneed-throwing Once-ler despite the protests of the namesake Lorax, a horny, bearded creature "who speaks in the name of trees".
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax 20 times in a row to a child.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text probably came from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was supplied by Cameron's staff, but did not provide any further direct comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened with exclusion from England's team, but it's still hard.
To hit Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you look at the squad England has chosen for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat is not on my map.
I wouldn't rule out a foreign victory.
Alastair Cook's site may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting lineup, and the community spirit is strong; they won't wear scars from 2012, just a youth-positive attitude.
With the ball Moeen Ali develops as a spin bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he represents an unknown size at test level, is an option for the attack.
This is the news: Adam Lyth is leaving the England Test squad and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to dismiss Adam Lyth is, of course, hard for me as his head coach in Yorkshire to analyze.
In his seven tests, there were two good strikes under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricketers are focused on results.
There were no question marks on Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, because -- and I said that before -- players are their own best picks.
Long ago, Lyth would have been extended, but he was in control of his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he can get another run for Yorkshire, another chance will come.
England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even though he did not perform as well, and that does not surprise me; he is above all a team man.
The question of how much time a test batsman gets to make his mark is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances, like Sam Robson did before him, while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play home and away.
The only accusation that could be made was that England first deployed Jonathan Trott to the Caribbean when Lyth was in top form, but that lost opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a hit man I appreciate.
He's an X-Factor cricketer, which we saw at Yorkshire earlier this season, when he scored 236 against us at a Trent Bridge ground, which hit us very hard.
He must have at least the same chances as before, but that depends of course on the squad in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of having Moeen beat Cook next to him, which would produce an extra spin bowler and get four quicks, popped up, and I'm not against it.
I don't see why a batsman can't hit there, and this left-hander has already shown that he's a cricket-playing devil's son.
Moeen may not have done his job for his county Worcestershire, but he's number three for them, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Tests on the first drop before making his debut as a starter in 2001.
He hit three hundred runs straight away and never looked back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as a backup spinner, and in my limited dealings with him, he impressed me a lot as a young man.
People might look at his stats -- 31 on average with the bat and 35 with the ball -- and think it's a point, but there's not a huge number of backup spinners raising their hands and the coaches have chosen youth.
He'll learn a lot on this tour.
Aside from the team, England has made some clever additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lankan batsman, as a consultant for the Tests could be a master coup.
He's one of the nicest guys in the game, and he's going to bring a wealth of experience, because he's played under all conditions and against all odds.
Paul Collingwood is coming for the white-ball stage of the tour, bringing energy and a powerful effort to the setup.
I always felt he was made for international cricket, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he had insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room can bring fresh air, even if the news is consistent with what was said before.
Collys teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not being used in the ODIs, Root got a similar break against Australia and I, for my part, have no problem with that.
Some may disagree, but coaches and team leaders do not set the timetable.
And you have to remember that, like the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made with an easy heart.
The Brexit camp could gain momentum if the economy falls into a slump by 2017
David Cameron's unprecedented renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting more and more difficult every day, even without the choice of the genius Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn to lead Labour or the TUC, which was fiercely divided over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages too.
A friend of a European diplomat said the other day that some Member States, as deeply embroiled in various crises as the EU is now, and not always by their own fault, are fed up with the UK's own agenda of split concessions and disruptive treaty changes that they usually do not want.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it also does not like them when they endanger social protection.
We could call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
Prime Ministers and finance ministers climb summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say they're gaining allies for reform.
It's always about me.
My European friend who wants an outward-looking Britain inside the EU tent - "Let's not be alone with France", says Berlin - is showing that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where they don't care if we stay or leave.
Germany's carefully surprised Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave before it looks bad for her, as has happened to the overly long-standing Thatcherists (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande looks forward to his re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain a left-wing one.
It's hard to imagine that they're going to tear out a leg to help the selfie Britons, whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK -- something they don't want to do either, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
So it's possible that some of these ministers are even deliberately planning unhelpful remarks, all in the SNP style, during the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a failure" and "Britain gained nothing of value from the renegotiation".
The Europeans know how plundering Fleet Street can be at their expense and what EU sceptics are the oligarchy of the press barons, as they were not during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, which supported our entry into 1973 in a ratio of 2:1.
You may remember Boris Johnson, the former euro-opportunist who made a name for himself as an EU equal bananas Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
In all his madness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
That included the medley of tax-scaring crooks, phone-hacking foreigners and the pseudo-non-native citizens who own most of our major newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought the same thing about her, but he found that if you're sitting in a cage with a hot gorilla, you'd better distribute bananas to distract him rather than become his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blair than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum campaign, because Blair had laid the groundwork for the unadopted EU Constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 who opened a back door for him.
The press never forgave him for that.
But the kind Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly slap on the back at Westminster on Monday - I told him he didn't need to waste any more time on me - seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's 1980s boycott Murdoch strategy, a mistake he made then and today.
It may take time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy to win the media over, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is - I would like to express it kindly - in development.
He says we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of the traditional blue-collar Ukip trend and the wildest fields of Tory's small-Englishness, I guess everyone can say yes to that.
It's what Hilary "A Benn, but no Bennite" Benn said on radio and television this week as the scout in him struggled not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of the provocative John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his old father was on television trying to be unfaithful to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But fighting to stay "under all circumstances" - Benn's expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor was it what JC told his fellow soldiers and MPs, according to all reports, at their Monday night audition.
Whatever the moving bottom-up image of Corbyn is trying to convey -- remember, it touched me too -- news discipline remains important in the age of 24-hour TV and above all in the social media bubble, a breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a free hand to Europe that allows him to take Labour's support for the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell said.
I'm sure that's what Simon Jenkins thinks.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental ambiguities about EU membership - in line with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past - are no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among leftist dissidents, for whom the narcissism of small differences is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with his ambiguities about NATO - Tom Watson is firmly convinced that JC is not launching an exit campaign - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to make sense of their superiors at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British when all this can be pointless?
The US is already pretty disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with the Tory government's cost of power reduction, which reminded me when I launched on Monday of what was called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize a report by Public Health England on e-cigarettes
Claims by a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking stemmed from a meeting of 12 people, some with ties to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet in criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the 'principle report' last month, describing it as a 'comprehensive review of the evidence'.
However, some researchers have questioned the data's reliability, pointing to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month addressed the "extremely windy basis" on which PHE based its most important conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and have asked whether the claims are "based on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proving effectiveness".
They said the public expects PHE's claim that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95 percent less harmful than smoking" to be based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people convened to develop a model for multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to synthesize their views on the harm of various nicotine products, and the results of the meeting were summarised in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose managing director is said to have previously received British American Tobacco funds (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed BAT's public health references in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting said he was receiving funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer but not the funding he was reportedly receiving from tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The reasons for the selection of the members of the panel are not provided, but they include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also indicate an industry financing in the paper.
Some other participants in this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The tobacco management of PHE also attended the meeting.
The group's research "significantly admits" that there is a lack of "strong evidence for the harmfulness of most products under most criteria", wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links or limitations are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's claims that "there is no evidence to date that e-cigarettes are a way to smoke for children or non-smokers" were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellness at PHE, said that BMJ's claims had already been addressed.
He said, "E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking".
One in two smokers dies of their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low compared to this, but that we still have to study their long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what it does not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers of tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die each year from a smoking-related illness, and smoking costs the national health system two billion pounds a year.
By presenting clear, current evidence that e-cigarettes are not risk-free, but only a fraction of the harm caused by smoking, we are fulfilling our national responsibility.
BBC should quit EastEnders, says former Channel 4 boss
Former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes like EastEnders and The Voice, saying commercial rivals would "give their right arm" to hit shows like the Albert Square soap.
Johnson said the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programmes that are not broadcast by other UK stations.
He criticised the BBC for placing public affairs programmes likely to be seen by a smaller audience in highly controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and by broadcasters such as BBC4.
After BBC Director-General Tony Hall said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said that he had tried unsuccessfully to contact the BBC for six years during his time at Channel 4 without success.
"I have trouble with the idea that the BBC is commissioning or broadcasting programmes that would also be clearly shown by unsubsidized rivals", Johnson told the House Communications Committee as part of his investigation into the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the broadcast fee, which I don't think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least put your production on programs that others don't make or commission.
They're sending The Voice in a prime time window because they want to reach the widest possible support for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's obviously nonsense.
Johnson said, "I don't see why regressive tax programs should be funded, which could be funded without subsidies.
The Voice is one of those shows, EastEnders is another, admittedly, self-produced show.
Honestly, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I try to see what public television is like.
I don't think that would diminish the BBC at all.
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC was to blame for the review hunt "because of the ambitions of the people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long-term support".
His comments on the BBC's most popular shows reflect what former Sky executive Tony Ball suggested in his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh that the BBC should sell shows like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the more publicly-regulated niche programmes "should go to BBC4, where you can't quite measure the audience, but they do their job, and they can argue that when they go on their hypocritical missions to justify £4 billion in broadcasting fees, "Well, of course, we've created all these obscure programmes that nobody's seen".
They put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them.
As for the broadcasting fee, Johnson told the committee: "I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of terms, who can get the best value from it.
Of course you all think, we all think that you get a lot of money for £150 a year here, but for people who are a lot of money for £150, ask me if that's true because they don't consume much of the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief David Elstein, who also testified before the committee on Tuesday, called on the BBC to review its Reithian mission to "inform, educate and entertain".
He said very little of the BBC's production would now be officially classified as education -- he said it was 1 percent of their TV production and 0.1 percent of their radio production -- and they should take an example from the public television stations in Australia and Canada to change this into "informing, educating and entertaining".
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas like proms, which he said only a handful of people are showing on television, and make alliances with commercial broadcasters to make everything available online.
Sonogenetics can control brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction the moment they are irradiated with sound impulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by sound wave outbreaks.
The tiny nematodes change direction the moment they are irradiated by sound pulses that are too high for human hearing to hear.
The impulses work by turning on motor neuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new process called sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a range of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that sends electrical impulses to the human brain to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Fadenmurs don't usually respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did when surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found, amplify the ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate the worms.
The amplified ultrasonic waves affect structures called TRP-4 ion channels found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a report by Nature Communications.
To create ultrasonic-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically altered the worms so that some of their motor neurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When he applies ultrasound to the altered creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the microbes and transmitted to the worms, where they turn on the altered motor neurons.
The method has some similarities with optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off with pulses of light.
But Chalasani said that sonogenetics might have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent down to the desired location in the brain by an optical fiber, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissues unhindered and can be sent to the brain from above the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neurons susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments", Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture devices - right outside your door!
The ads shame the arms trade in Britain
Watch the video of Amnesty International's anti-weapons fair.
They're horrible killer drones!
You're crushing your ankle!
We have bombs!
And electroshock rods that cause excruciating pain, but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that this ad for the world's largest arms fair is a combat parody produced by Amnesty International to highlight the British government's willingness to smuggle weapons to a repressive regime through the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also results in many posters that can be seen at bus stops and on subway trains and that require a second look.
"Important announcement: Are you riding the DLR from September 15 to 18?" (Docklands Light Railway) read in the London Underground typeface and the DLR line trademark, which turns into a tank image.
In September, a bunch of arms dealers will be driving the DLR... asking customers to help stop the arms fair.
The 300 posters are from artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy's Dismalland.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped distribute the book in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs", a £6 package of inbox keys claiming to "get access to about a third of the bus stops on the planet".
Transport for London does not find this "vandalism" poster funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more critical and are trying to bring political works to audiences outside galleries.
Many artists work with activists within protest movements and realize that they need to go outside into the real world in order for their art to have an impact on society.
Another anti-arms poster greets commuters on the subway.
The Amnesty video has been viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works with the nonprofit graphic artist and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence surrounding the gun show commercials -- through a gap in the ExCeL calendar -- and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid".
They played with the invention of a more realistic, shady corporate advertising, but "by embedding bright colors and animation, it remains more adherent".
"They did a fantastic job of helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair", says Tom Davies of Amnesty International.
What we need now is an intervention by the British government and a guarantee that torture devices will not be smuggled out of our doorstep illegally.
Perhaps the most creative art around the gun show comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors are sculpting fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed a US Army order about the "AT4CS RS shot from the shoulder".
This includes a "uniquely shaped warhead that delivers outstanding effects within the target".
Whatever that causes, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in student housing
Eleven years ago, as a self-forgetting 19-year-old, I moved into a boarding school, still believing in Berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I've angered - and the numerous long-winded complaints about others.
Most of what I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The number of students who move into residential homes ranges from mildly nervous to absolutely frightening.
It's tempting to chat: people tell you where you come from, if and where you took the Sabbath year, where you stand in relation to Corbyn and why you "Honestly neither love nor hate Marmite, because seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I'm in my room".
Breathe through.
And help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find the people you like as opposed to the people you wouldn't talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and those were fire extinguishers.
Let the people.
People's rooms often turn into drinks receptions, movie night venues and community meeting places, but they're also places where people dress up and pull their underwear.
Related to: Don't forget to start a relationship at university
Introverts are treated roughly at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student residences form a room-to-room bumblebee culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendships.
This could be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to last, but you have to leave so I can get back the energy I used to interact with you".
Try to sense when a fellow person is exhausted from company - and text him instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking, do it.
A guy in my dorm room had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Friendship is made by baking.
As you start college at the height of the back-mania, knocking on people's doors to introduce yourself with a plate of brownies is less strange than saying, "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something. So, now please smile when I ask you some personal questions".
Offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obligated to talk and may eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, that depends on whether you're a decent baker.
Badly mixed lumps of flour, sugar and fat cause people to fall asleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student housing.
Of course, clawing chickens is a theft, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check with the milkman.
Chances are they'll say to serve themselves, even if they're cooking indoors.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you have my sympathy, but try to handle it more balanced than my roommate who added a laundry detergent to her milk to punish thieves.
She's in prison now.
You shouldn't make any noise that keeps people from sleeping or working.
It's not just about being a decent person, but that you are, in the true sense of the word, one of the people who sit in the glass house.
A girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if they'd mind putting the drum and bass down a little bit, because it was three in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
When they finally stopped at 5 a.m., she kindly let her neighbors sleep for two more hours before letting her own music play, closing her door, and taking her three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same student residence?
Conversely, would it not be deeply embarrassing to think of a roommate as your future spouse, to approach her, to separate again, and then to see her every day, and perhaps to witness her attract all her mutual friends?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to make sense of your gut.
The exciting moment you notice someone leaving their keys in their unlocked room, the line between a ulcer and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good joke is fun, but it only takes a few moments to turn into a bummer.
Teach a valuable and fun lesson about safety by hiding, but never mess up someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their door and put their keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but do not lock their belongings on the ceiling more than twice.
The Commission has also adopted a number of measures to ensure that the measures are implemented in accordance with the common position.
In the central Frankish Eckental, the real estate developer Markus Gildner is building row houses for people who don't have much money.
So for refugees, for example, but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need housing, but also the single mother and the low-income mother".
"I'm showing you how to build cheaply and well today", says the 44-year-old in the interview
Thousands of refugees will be forced into the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes he knows how to quickly create affordable housing: he is building row houses for refugees in a project.
Mr. Gildner, many refugees will be pushing into the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The mass housing in containers or gyms is not sustainable.
Because most people stay here.
In view of the refugee influx, we will need adequate housing in the coming decades.
A very banal, three-story row house is the solution.
A row house needs the least space.
It makes integration easier.
It's different when you put people in blocks.
Each of the six houses currently under construction in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each.
Each apartment has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It's possible that many refugees will say, "It's peace again, I'm going back".
Then the houses can be easily converted to suit their needs.
How much is the cost?
Gildner: The price for 160 square metres of living space per house is 184,000 euros, without land.
It's manageable.
It took six months to build.
That's all right.
Did the building codes complicate their plans?
Gildner: I've been doing my project correctly.
The threat of the Damokles sword makes it particularly complicated.
It's creepy.
It is still assumed that those who create three apartments in a row house need at least three seats.
Only the cities have no place for it.
And refugees and asylum seekers don't have cars.
How did the residents react to their row house project?
Gildner: There were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which is definitely not true.
But aren't you stepping up the competition for affordable housing?
Gildner: It's true: We've had a boom in construction in Germany in the last five years, but luxury apartments have been built that hardly anyone can afford.
My project has the message that even normal people need housing.
Not just refugees, but the single mother or the under-paid.
I'm showing you how to build cheaply and well today.
That's what it's all about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem engineering in Regensburg and first worked in environmental analysis.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple Update is released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, tapping "General" and then selecting "Software Update".
When it's ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then install.
Some have encountered problems after installation, as they receive an error message saying that the "software update has failed".
To avoid the problem, users are advised to either wait until the rush recedes or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to make room for them, but Apple has made it less likely by slowing down the update, and it's going to be easier to do that if you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is complete.
It's worth making sure your mobile phone is charged during the update or is near a charger so the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple will not allow the update to continue, as the phone may shut down halfway and this could lead to a break in the update.

Rosberg's only motto is "Full attack".
Nico Rosberg's Formula One World Championship fight against his clear-cut Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton has only one motto: "Full attack".
The World Cup runner-up stressed before the start of the decisive seven overseas races that "I have nothing left to lose".
53 points separates the reigning world champion from the late-night race in Singapore this Sunday from defending champion and two-time champion Hamilton.
The Briton has already won seven of the previous twelve races and is also taking the city-state floodlight Grand Prix as a favourite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old Briton won the race.
Whether the current smog in the city-state will affect the Singapore Grand Prix is still unclear.
For days, a fog bell has been hanging over the city, sparked by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chess Club has a prominent member
The three-month-old chess club Bad Kissingen has added another member to its ranks, bringing the number of members to 19.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who spent more than 40 years in Bad Kissingen for treatment.
Gauselmann is a recipient of the Federal Cross of Merit 1st class and an honorary citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
The Bad Kissingen chess club was supported by Gauselmann with a donation that was accepted by its chairman, Alfred Klein.
This makes it possible to take in players who cannot contribute to the membership fee.
Youth work and talent search should also be promoted.
Gauselmann wants his membership in the chess club and his friendly contact with the red-white tennis club to be seen as an expression of his connection to the resort town.
Quarter office is looking for direct contact
Saludis and the Antonistift Senior Centre have joined forces under the guise of the Social Foundation and opened a new contact point at Graf-Stauffenberg Square.
In addition to counselling, you can also take courses there.
The social foundation is pulling it down the mountain into the city center.
Specifically, the Graf-Stauffenberg square.
A new district office was recently opened there.
Here, right next to the shopping mall, seniors and counsellors can now get information on questions such as health insurance or health and care benefits.
For years, we have been observing with our outpatient care services that often caregivers are left alone.
There are infinitely many questions.
"It is also not uncommon for many benefits to be taken over by the insurance companies because the complexity of insurance is hardly understood", explained the new housekeeper Jutta Weigand, who, as head of department, is also responsible for the Antonistift and the Civic Hospital and the Amadeus ambulance service.
In addition to the counselling, the new district office also offers prevention, health and wellness courses.
The Saludis were taken to the boat.
Therefore, you can use additional services such as fall prevention, memory training, or physiotherapy.
The offerings of the senior centre and the Saludis are ideally complementary.
Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and rehabilitation.
'The senior centre for care and care', said Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis.
The reason for opening the new district office in the city centre is seen by both managers in particular in demographic change.
This will make good decentralised infrastructure in the various districts of Bamberg essential in the future.
In addition, as Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) stressed at the opening ceremonies, the Quarter Office also focuses on the elderly association: "There are numerous events and offers on the programme and they invite you to a regular social gathering".
The social foundation has thus made a major contribution to the independence and well-being of the elderly in their familiar environment.
The district office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9am to 2pm, Tuesday and Thursday from 4pm to 6pm and Saturday from 10am to 12pm.
Eintracht Bamberg against Würzburg Kickers on the 6th of October
Now it is official: after the completion of the renovation work at the Fox Park Stadium, the date for the match against third-league club Würzburg Kickers FC Eintracht Bamberg had not yet been set, October 6 has now been set as the date.
The match of FC Eintracht Bamberg in the eighth final of the Bavarian Football Totopokal against third-tier club Würzburg Kickers has now been finalized.
The game will be played on Tuesday, October 6th at 7:00 p.m. at the Bamberger Fox Park Stadium.
"We are happy that we now know when the game will go on stage, now we have planning certainty", said FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the pre-sale of tickets that has just started.
It's something special for our team to play against a third-league player.
We therefore hope for a large audience, and this is not without reason, because flute games have a special appeal.
In the last 16 teams round, FC Eintracht Bamberg entered 2010 by winning the regional league 1st FC Oberhaid (3:1) and at home against the regional league 1st FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition will receive 5000 euros and qualify for the first round of the 2016/2017 DFB Club Cup.
The defending champion is third-tier SpVgg Unterhaching.
Vienna architect Karl Mang died aged 92
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of Viennese architecture, is dead.
He passed away on September 5 at the age of 92, the Artists' House said Tuesday.
With Mang, the artist's house loses an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as the broadcast said.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna under Friedrich Lehmann during and after World War II.
He worked as a freelance architect from 1952 onwards, but also worked as a teacher, writer and institute director.
From 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute for Design.
In the 1980s he was commissioned to set up the Treasury in the Vienna Hofburg and convert the Lobkowitz Palace into the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Tim Wiese charges a police officer with money
Former football player Tim Wiese has been unwell in Bremen.
Tim Wiese, former national goalkeeper in Germany and a former Bremen and Hoffenheim professional wrestler.
He claims to have gained 30 kilograms of muscle mass over the past two years.
He did not, intellectually, do so.
Weese was getting his hair cut in downtown Bremen when he saw a parking guard outside issuing a ticket for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Wiese then stormed out of the business, insulting the official, and throwing the due fine at her feet, reports The Picture.
The city of Bremen confirms the allegations, but is not yet clear about the consequences of the unusual incident.
"The matter is still being examined", says the city of Bremen.
Only then will it be decided whether or not to display Wiese.

Men beating up 17-year-old Afghans
Witnesses are being sought by the police for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, at about 11:45 p.m., three young men were walking from Bad Soden towards Salmünster.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, reportedly followed his two friends about five meters away and told them to wait for him.
At that time the group was at the height of the bft-fuel station.
Three people also stopped at the gas station.
One of these men now shouted at the young man and punched him in the face.
The victim suffered a broken nose bone and bleed heavily from the nose.
When his two friends rushed in and urged the victim to speak, he first abandoned his victim.
His friends have now taken the injured young man home.
The perpetrator pursued the group in a car to their apartment and demonstrated several times.
When the vehicle was no longer visible, the injured man went outside the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked again by the baton and another male.
With the help of a baton, the victim's face and thighs were beaten.
The injured man had to be taken to a hospital for medical treatment.
So far, there's only a vague description of the perpetrator.
One of the men was about six feet tall.
The second bat was said to have been about six feet tall and was wearing jeans and a brown-white shirt.
The police are asking witnesses and whistleblowers to report to the telephone number 06181/100-123
Dr. Frank Müller takes over the felstehausen practice and invests 310,000 euros
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
The Commission has also adopted a proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment and the environment.
In many places in the country doctors are lacking - Asendorf, on the other hand, is lucky: Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of the stone house there on 1 October.
While Ursel Felstehausen is retiring, her husband Karl-Heinrich will be at his successor's side for the next few months with half a job.
After a phase of rebuilding, Müller reopens the practice on 12 October, by which time he will have invested 310000 euros in the premises on St. Marcellusstraße 6.
It was sympathy at first glance when the Rockefeller family met Frank Müller and his wife, Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll, who is currently completing her doctoral training at Verdener Hospital and also intends to enter practice next year.
"We always thought that the Muellers would be a good fit for this practice", says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen, laughing.
"When it was time, I just called her".
The Müller couple liked the idea of starting their own practice in Asendorf.
"The close proximity and constant contact with patients is very attractive to us", says the 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to meet and accompany the families over the years".
He also sees it as an advantage to be his own boss soon.
And so they agreed that the Muellers bought the house with the practice.
They will, however, continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
There the double father Frank Müller also grew up, his medical studies in Hannover were followed by stations in several medical practices as well as in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as a general practitioner in Sulingen, and in 2009 was appointed chief emergency physician in the district of Diepholz.
From 19 September, the practice will be prepared for the new boss.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen worked as a house doctor, his wife Ursel (internist) specialized in gastroenterology.
The Muellers, both internists, want to settle down as housewives.
"That's why the endoscopy comes out", says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the renovation, the rooms will look more modern.
We're going to offer more ultrasound scans and long-term and stress EKGs and we need more talk rooms.
The computer is also being completely refurbished.
The grant totalling EUR 50000 is provided to the Müllers under a support programme from the county (25000 EUR) and from the municipality of Samt (12500 EUR) and the municipality (12500 EUR).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is being continued", says Mayor Bernd Bormann of Samt.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, about 2,000 patients are admitted to the felstehausen clinic every quarter, while the average in northern Germany is about 500.
There's another home doctor's office in Asendorf.
A positive side effect of the acquisition of the practice by Frank Müller: according to Ursel Felstehausen, the pharmacy will remain in Asendorf.
If she hadn't found a successor, she would have left too.
The people who attend Müller's class are still, by the way, familiar with the seven medical specialists and the cleaning staff of the stone houses.
With their departure, an era ends in Asendorf, where the doctors have practiced for 30 years.
"In the beginning we had only two rooms", recalls Ursel Felstehausen, smiling.
She's feeling a little bit sad after a long time.
"But we still live in Hohenmoor and will surely see many patients more often", says the internist.
Her husband adds, laughing, "We have a 6,000-square-foot plot".
"I've always pushed myself to garden, now it could be different".
In addition, the couple has two grandchildren and enjoys traveling.
Croatia: "We are letting the refugees through"
"Border controls are now being increased at our southern border", said Minister of the Interior Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The controls at the Hungarian border remain in place in parallel.
It is still clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can make it "self-evident".
The provision and safety of the people are of the utmost importance.
It is clear, however, that "clear signals are needed", the Minister said.
People need to know that we do not accept borderless migration, even across the Austrian-Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia considers the 'corridor' - Slovenia refuses
The Croatian government had previously said that Slovenia also wanted to allow arriving refugees to continue their journey to Austria and Germany and that it might also build corridors for the refugees.
The Commission has not yet taken a decision on the proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment.
The idea of corridors is 'absolutely unacceptable' and Slovenia will intensify border surveillance, especially with Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, is already heavily controlled as the external border of the Schengen area.
The Minister stressed that Slovenia does not want to close its borders to refugees.
"Every EU member must fulfil its obligations or the system cannot work", stressed Györkös Znidar.
The Croatian government said that the first refugees had tried to enter eastern Croatia at the Tovarnik/Sid border crossing in the early hours of Tuesday night to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to catch her in the nearby cornfields.
According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees have been continuously arriving in Tovarnik, Croatia, ever since.
The main victims were Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are already in operation.
In the coming days, his country expects about 4,000 refugees, Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be diverted to Croatia, Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday in agreement.
The Belgrade government, however, denied that it was directing people to take certain routes: "We cannot and do not want to do this", it said.
According to media reports, at least one bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid in the early hours of the morning, and more buses were expected later in the day.
From Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been traveling through Serbia all night from the Macedonian border, some 500 kilometers [500 miles] away.
"We heard Hungary was closing in, so the police told us to drive here", said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
This could in fact lead to the shift of the previous Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary to a slightly more western route, as observers had already predicted.
Croatia: 'Comprehensive possibilities for border control'
Croatia's Minister of the Interior Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a large influx of refugees.
He did not give details, but pointed out that as a non-Schengen member, Croatia has 'comprehensive border control capabilities'.
The European Union has also been able to support the implementation of the Schengen acquis.
Slovenia has been a member since 2007 and the EU partners have since been giving the country a good testimony on the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, about 300 refugees remain trapped behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade media reports, they spent the night at the Horgos border crossing leading to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossing points Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed.
It is not clear whether the remaining refugees will now travel to the Croatian border.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm the debate on alternative routes for refugees after the Hungarian border was closed early on Wednesday.
It would not be a very high refugee figure at the moment.
It is not yet known whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or any other country.
Helpers advise migrants to take dangerous alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee helpers have already started distributing maps to refugees showing alternative routes through Croatia.
However, the crossing of the border between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless: in parts of the border area, 20 years after the end of the Croatian War, there are still minefields that have not been cleared.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of miners had been sent to the border region.
Stock market hackers: Ukrainians are paying $30 million
Supranonok is said to have been part of a cybercriminal ring accused of continuously gaining access to unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
The information obtained is believed to have been used to conduct insider deals on financial markets.
According to the investigators, over $100 million was raised in this way.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our national borders will eventually be caught", the SEC statement said.
The trials against 32 other defendants in the case were ongoing.
Most of the accused are from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are said to have been both from the United States and Eastern Europe.
The European Commission has been working on the proposal for a directive on the protection of workers in the field of social security.
There is a lively operation around the Mannheim parade ground.
People do their jobs, sometimes in quick steps, sometimes in a comfortable walk.
You're in charge of the two stations at the Mannheim Motor Show at the parade ground.
Stop the trains.
Pulsing, vibrant life in the glorious autumn sunshine and in the middle of it four large plates each with the headline "Before I Die I Want"...
The ecumenical hospice service has been making its 20th anniversary known through this action and is facing mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went into the city and among the people with the action", says Josefine Lammer.
The Head of the Ecumenical Hospice is available to passersby for questions and discussions as are the volunteers.
While some passersby spontaneously reach for the chalk and add the phrases "yes to my life", "can read", "to drive the camper through the U.S"., "stop the war", or "don't suffer long", others stand still, read, say phrases like "I'm not that far away" and then move on.
There's always a little discussion on the sidelines about the action itself, about life, about dealing with death.
Peter Hübinger is also on the scene.
"Only when I realize that the world is coming to an end for me can I live responsibly", says the director of the Mannheim Deaconess Works, which together with the Caritas Association carries out the Ecumenical Hospice Aid.
This publicity campaign is therefore good for the 20-year-old.
It is understandable, however, that not everyone on the boards wants to communicate publicly, because it is a very personal matter.
The subject of death and dying is still taboo, according to the experience of Josefine Lammer, although the hospice movement has been a major contributor to the opening up of people in recent years.
An opinion shared by Angelika Godfroid.
The death and mourning companion is one of the volunteers in the first hour.
Through personal experience, she read a lot of literature and decided to become involved in assisted dying.
When the Ecumenical Hospice Service called volunteers, it immediately registered and was present at its founding in 1995.
Godefroid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - who accompany the victims and their families in private homes, hospitals, nursing homes and the St Vincent's Hospice.
They're all very well trained.
Angelika Godefroid is good at handling her task and the experiences and experiences she has gained.
"I see life from another perspective, consider it precious, and appreciate the moment", she says.
The outpatient ecumenical hospice service is free of charge and is independent of religion.
The financial support of health funds and donations from family members and associations enables the training, training and supervision of the death and mourning attendants.
Training for new employees is offered every two years.
The tablets described on Saturday are now on display at the Evangelical Church House (M1, 1a) and the Catholic Church House (F2, 6).
There, too, you can write down other personal wishes on postcards.
FedEx results mixed, financial outlook decreased for 2016
FedEx reports disappointing results for the past quarter, and the supply giant cut its earnings prospects to a full year because of weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transportation service.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The stock fell over 2.5 percent in pre-market trades 45 minutes before opening Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it's earning between $10.40 and $10.90 a year for the fiscal year ending next May, 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84 from a FactSet survey.
The lower outlook comes despite price increases of 4.9% on average, effective on 4 January, and despite higher surcharges for the transport of heavy and large parcels from November onwards.
The company said that it nevertheless expects the profit to increase compared to the previous year due to cost reductions, higher revenues and growth in online commerce.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company "generates solid returns when you consider the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade".
The plans for the holiday employment were announced a day later than that of rival UPS, which plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6 percent from the previous year.
The earnings per share were $2.42 per share, just below the $2.44 per share forecast by 12 analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research.
Sales increased 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts Zack interviewed expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipments in recent years, which has stagnated its turnover in its Express Shipping unit.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, sales for ground transport increased by 29 percent, but operating income was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result decreased due to higher labour costs in freight.
In pre-market trading, about an hour before opening, FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, they closed with a loss of 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.
At their most anticipated meeting of the year, Federal Reserve strategists are spending two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahagoni table to decide if it's time to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A mural of the United States is looming over them at one end of the ornate, two-story meeting hall.
The map is a reminder that Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the nation's economic interests ahead of everything else.
The central bank has a dual mandate from Congress: maximize U.S. employment and keep prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, Fed leaders have recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X-Factor in a decision that's too tight to predict, and it's going to be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to start to be weaned off the unprecedented stimulus by the near-zero short-term interest rate since late 2008.
Although most economic data show that it is growing solidly, recent turbulence in global financial markets could make the already cautious Fed officials fear increasing this volatility by raising interest rates on federal bonds - even by a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing they're watching", said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise interest rates, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is justification enough to keep waiting", she said.
There's no consensus on what the Fed is going to do, which in itself is making the financial market uncertain.
About half of the economists recently interviewed by Bloomberg predicted interest rate hikes this week.
However, the financial markets expect the Fed to wait, with a key indicator that indicates only a 30% chance of a rise.
This suggests a decline in the stock market if the Fed raises the rate, unless the strategists ease the blow by promising that another increase is far from over.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 228.89 points or 1.4 percent to 16,599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that Fed policy would maintain the rate this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed raised rates at this point", he said.
If it does, "it would have to go very far in its statement to calm the financial markets so they don't panic".
Other experts argued that a rate hike would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
A month ago, the Fed seemed well on its way to raising the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the United States.
Yellen had said in the spring and early summer that despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress would be needed, she expected an increase in the rate this year.
Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labour market this year was solid.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 percent last month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to what the Fed considers full employment.
Increases in wages have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation was consistently below the central bank's annual target of 2 percent, Fed officials said the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tensions in the labor market", said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world collapsed at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 16% below its peak in May, when investors feared a slowdown in the Chinese economy would dampen global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now almost 10% below the May high.
For the Fed, the turbulence of the market affects the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates.
"If the events in the financial markets and the news of the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks had not taken place, they would have been taking control of this session", said Stephen D. Oliner, senior research fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US Federal Reserve.
Now he predicts she'll wait at least a month to get a better handle on the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be, and there is almost no reliable data to describe developments in China", Oliner said.
The health of the world economy is not one of the Fed's main concerns, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed has become the world's currency authority.
The influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere indication by then-leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "tighten" its monetary expansion sparked confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed officials can be expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is "more art than science", said Zachary Karabell, global asset management strategy manager at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noted this month that "the Fed has a history of overreacting to financial market movements that are apparently unrelated to the fundamentals of the economy".
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, who advocates a rate hike, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions "despite limited noticeable impacts on U.S. growth", Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed reversed these cuts.
The Fed should only put financial stability first during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market crash, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate-fixing committee.
The latest turbulence is not coming close to this level, he said.
"She certainly doesn't want to get into the situation where she's afraid of a rate hike because markets are upset", said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I don't think it should be ahead of time.
You need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/store was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public.
Yeah, he's in Chinatown, not Thai Town.
The market/shop is a focal point and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and dishes, furniture, religious jewellery and Christmas decorations.
There's even a car department if you need engine oil.
The store is huge, and it takes over an hour to walk through the hallways.
If all the shopping makes you hungry, there's a meal for you on the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The kitchen (good and cheap) at this store is close to the box office and has various take-out options.
What's in here: Do you need anything - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Products are cheap and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh produce includes Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs, fruits and much more.
The meatpacking is extensive, as is the fishpacking - the staff behind the counter will clean and filet the fish and even fry it for you if you want.
A good part of the store is the massive freezer department, where you'll find frozen curry leaves, bitter melons and galgants, whole ducks, fish, beef and veal, pork intestines, fish balls, regional sausage, commercial food, and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and chefs, even individual families and individuals.
The wide corridors are suitable for shopping carts and forklifts.
You'll find it here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the box.
Location: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the edge of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the store is well-visited, it's not hard to find a parking space.
Today's news: Small living aid for refugees
More and more refugees are arriving in Germany these days.
The Commission has already decided to extend a warm welcome to the European Union.
There are also a number of people in Hoyerswerda who support the selfless asylum seekers in the city.
They include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
She still likes to teach with her 74 lenses.
Every Thursday she does it at the asylum-seeker's home on Dillinger Street.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan learn German.
Of course, this is a very different lesson than in a real school.
Brazil's Rio Grande Paediatric Society promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS is trying to shock women into the importance of proper nutrition during breastfeeding by showing pictures of babies sucking on breasts painted with images of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk is made up of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins, and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet for pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet can negatively affect the child's immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sports Hall
The Bernried Municipal Council approved the construction proposal for the 2,3 million euro sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may be flattened for solar.
Plans for the long-awaited Berner sports ground are moving forward step by step: the proposed building was unanimously approved at the recent municipal meeting without much discussion.
The Board had previously decided, inter alia, on a request for a 'exemption' or 'exemption' from the current building plan.
The 'exception' concerned the authorisation of a special shape for the roof construction.
Accordingly, a 'saddle roof with non-mid-first and rooftop' is to be constructed.
The plan is based on the planned use of the roof area for solar installations: "This will give us a wonderful large southern roof together", Mayor Josef Steigenberger explained at the meeting.
The 'liberation' was again about the slope of the roof, which, for energy reasons, is to be below 10 degrees, unlike the construction plan.
This will significantly reduce the volume of the hall.
The 'exemption' was necessary because the building plan does not allow for 'exceptions' to the roof slope - the Bernrieder Municipality Council is usually more restrictive in applying for exemption.
However, the construction of the gym is not a recurring project: "We are not setting a precedent", Steigenberger said.
The construction of the sports centre is a joint project between the municipality and SV Bernried.
The cost is estimated at around EUR 2.3 million.
Grants are expected from the promotion of school and broad sport.
In the next stage of the procedure, the application for the 18 x 36 metre hall will now be submitted to the Land Council for examination.
Peißenberg Hospital is moving to Schongau
The hospital in Peißenberg is to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) is appointed new Medical Director at the Schongau Hospital.
The station and the majority of its staff are moving from Peißenberg to Schongau.
This is the result of the surprising plans of the Landkreis Krankenhaus GmbH, which Landrat Andrea Jochner-Weiß confirmed.
The Board of Supervisors, however, will decide on this matter at its next meeting on Wednesday 23 September.
If the plans were implemented, all the fewer than 50 staff at the hospital in Peißenberg would continue to be employed.
The overwhelming majority should move to Schongau with fishermen and the still existing Inner Station.
The rooms are there.
The employees who cannot go to Schongau will be offered a job in Weilheim, Jochner-Weiß said.
The staff are informed of the plans.
The change was triggered by the resignation of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has been Medical Director of the Schongauer Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice near the hospital.
When asked who would succeed, according to Jochner-Weiß, the name "Fischer" came into play, who declared himself ready to take over the leadership from 1 October and to move to Schongau with his team.
In any case, this would mean an "evaluation" and a broadening of the offer in the field of internal medicine, according to Jochner-Weiß.
Fischer is a specialist in pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) is a specialist in gastroenterological diseases in the Inner Station.
The Commission has decided to take the necessary steps to ensure that the new hospital is fully operational and that the new hospital is fully operational.
The district had planned to do so in 2018 when the current renovation of Weilheim Hospital is completed.
Landratin Jochner-Weiß, who is also chair of the Supervisory Board, has opposed rumours that the house, which is owned by the German government, will be used as a shelter for asylum seekers in the future.
"I exclude that". As the property progresses, Jochner-Weiß could not say there were several considerations.
The hospital is currently a short-term care centre for Caritas and a day-care centre for psychiatrists.
"The best thing that could have happened to us is that such an opportunity never comes back", Fischer said of the near-missing of the lech, which was "positively and very understandably" taken up by the staff.
There was no real prospect of the house where Fisher has been working as a chief physician for over 30 years.
He was asked by his colleagues in Schongauer to take up the post of medical director.
The Peißenberg Hospital (once 100 beds) has repeatedly faced closure in recent decades, with departments being closed, such as surgery and obstetrics.
The Rhein-Neckar Lions handball players are called up tonight at the Bergische HC.
The Bundesliga's leader of the table is the clear favourite in Wuppertal, but there is no reason to be arrogant.
Last season, the Badgers suffered a painful defeat at the BHC and have something to make up for.
Hunting incident with two injured at Pratau
Two truckers were seriously injured by gunfire on Tuesday afternoon during their corn harvest.
During the harvesting on a cornfield near Pratau (Wittenberg county), several hunters were in operation, police said.
After a shooting, a 63-year-old man and a 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and were taken to hospitals.
How exactly the accident happened was unclear at first.
The C.P.D. is investigating.
Missing 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate Victims of Violent Crime
A suspect has led the police to the bodies of the 16-year-old missing since Saturday from Rhineland-Palatinate.
In the interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted to killing the teenagers and throwing their bodies into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old missing since Saturday from Rhineland-Palatinate has been the victim of a violent crime.
The young woman's body was found on Tuesday evening in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern, prosecutors and police said Wednesday.
The suspect is a 20-year-old man who was arrested on Tuesday night and who admitted to the crime and led investigators to the body.
The 16-year-old was reported missing on Sunday morning after failing to return home the night before after attending a fall festival in Rockenhausen.
When investigators searched for the young woman, they first came across personal belongings of the victim.
Interviews with friends and acquaintances of the missing eventually led to a criminal case against the 20-year-old.
The suspect then led the police to a canal in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
The arrested man admitted to killing the 16-year-old and dumping her body in the canal.
The 20-year-old was scheduled to be presented to the judge on Wednesday, and the investigators are charging him with manslaughter.
The further investigation is expected to provide details of the circumstances of the incident.
Refugees need shelter: study warns of housing shortages
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are looking for affordable housing.
The pressure on the housing market is increasing.
Social housing is a challenge.
The distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun.
With the arrival of refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pressing for a market that is already crowded in many major cities.
They're competing with low-income citizens for the last affordable housing.
To meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would have to be built every year by 2020.
This is the result of a study commissioned by the Social Housing Association.
By comparison, this year 260,000 units will be completed in Germany.
That's 140,000 homes missing.
Refugees are no longer required to live in a first-aid facility as asylum seekers after their first three months of stay.
Many then run into the housing market and line up in the long lines in front of the rental apartments.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year.
The negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing numbers of refugees.
The study also highlights significant failures in housing policy in recent years.
Germany is facing a housing shortage that is increasing year by year.
At present, there are already around 770,000 housing units missing in the urban areas, complained Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many workers therefore lived in urban areas in emergency rooms.
Young adults were staying in the Hotel Mama for a longer time, unwillingly, because of the flooding in the housing market.
In the big cities, the number of square meters per capita has fallen again for the first time in recent years.
To solve the problem, the Social Housing Alliance proposes a new start.
The aim of the new incentives is to stimulate social housing construction.
The Commission has therefore decided to extend the period of validity of the aid to the beneficiary.
The Alliance also calls for attractive tax deductions.
The State Bank KfW's refugee shelter support programme is already being well received by cities and municipalities.
A good week after the launch, more than half of the available €300 million had already been recalled on Monday evening with €184 million.
Now the project could even be upgraded.
Refugees have free movement: Croatia and Slovenia open a corridor
Hungary is virtually out of transit as more and more refugees choose to cross Croatia.
Zagreb announces the granting of free passage through Slovenia to the north.
But the route is still dangerous.
Croatia wants to negotiate with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a refugee corridor.
"I have spoken to the Slovenian Minister of the Interior and if necessary we will organise a corridor", said the Croatian Minister of the Interior, Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area.
The EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the closure of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have left for Croatia to reach Western Europe.
500 people crossed the border at Tovarnik, reports the Croatian TV channel RTL.
Hungary had sealed its border to refugees the day before.
New laws, which came into force on the same day, also make regular asylum procedures in Hungary virtually superfluous.
Croatia wants to let the refugees through.
The Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "You can travel through, and we are preparing for this opportunity".
These people are here, they're women, children, men, who want to live and achieve something.
But there were people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had seized the first refugees at the border of Serbia with the EU's neighbouring country of Croatia this morning.
Most of the media reports came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came to the Serbian border town of Sid by bus and taxi.
Immediately after their arrival they would have tried to cross the green border into Croatia on foot.
At the Croatian-Serbian border, refugees do not encounter border fences.
The border line is also a danger: it still contains mines from the Yugoslav civil war of the 1990s.
Mine clearance workers are now to quickly create a safe passage.
Hungary is hardly a destination for refugees after the border has been closed.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 people arrested.
Just before the score on Monday, it was still 9380 points.
The new Hungarian laws criminalize overcoming and damaging the border fence.
In the southern border town of Szeged, 35 criminal proceedings were opened.
The convicted face up to five years in prison and deportation.
According to the Immigration Office, a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the newly established "transit zones" at the border, almost all of them - 93 - at the main crossing of the Röszke.
The applicants included 13 families with young children and two elderly people.
On Wednesday morning, 40 other refugees were staying there.
In practice, however, no one has any prospect of being granted asylum in Hungary.
In Hungary's view, Serbia is a 'safe third country'.
The refused asylum seekers are to be deported there.
A few hundred refugees gathered outside the "transit zone" in Röszke.
In Röszke, workers began cleaning up.
They were collecting the trash that tens of thousands of people had left on the side of the road in the past few weeks.
The blockage grid was dismantled and one of the reception centres at the border site was rebuilt.
No one wanted to comment on the purpose of this conversion.
Austria has received very few refugees since the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary.
The country has also stepped up its border controls.
The government says that about 20,000 migrants remained in the country.
In Salzburg, about 1,400 people are waiting for the next trip to Germany.
The train service from there to Germany was stopped this morning at the direction of the German authorities.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees regularly entered on foot.
Mayor drove "Gestrandete" across the border
"We were busy cleaning up after Sunday's Bridge Festival when suddenly ten people with travel bags stood at the entrance to the tent", said Wernstein's mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they were going to Passau by train.
But because Germany had stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee stream, it was a surprise for them in Wernstein", said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and drove the strangers along with two other helpers and their cars across the border to nearby Passau.
We've been feeding the unexpected guests a stew and drinks.
We said we'd drive her to Passau.
"This was a matter of course for us", Stadler said in the OÖN interview.
You were very grateful.
One man did not dare to make a generous donation - 100 euros to the fire department.
"We were very pleased", said Stadler.
The stranded train passengers had been transferred from an ICE to a regional train heading for Passau on Sunday evening in Wels to try to cross the border after the short-term announcement that rail traffic to Germany had been suspended.
The regional train was stopped at the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein, cross-border traffic is generally high.
The bridge festival was held on Sunday in association with the Bavarian neighbours, the day before a two-bridge race - organised by the Union Wernstein and Bayern from Neukirchen.
That Viktor Orbán is sending tens of thousands more to us is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of helping to build structures to ensure humanity at Camp Röszke, our Chancellor has publicly and highly publicly put the attitude of the Hungarian government into the dustbin of National Socialism.
The problem is that the Commission has not yet adopted a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers' rights.
The refugees will also have to realize that the "promised land" that invited and welcomed them is nothing more than another refugee camp.
It will be a major challenge, given the ongoing refugee flows and the coming winter, to create humane conditions for asylum seekers in our country.
And it will be even greater - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad is looking for 35,000 winter-proof neighborhoods
Konrad has a lot to do with refugee housing.
Christian Konrad is used to his word being weighty.
The government has used the formerly powerful Raiffeisen bankers to build quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos at the Traiskirchen First Residence has already got Konrad in control.
"We no longer have homeless people in Traiskirchen", he reported on his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who arrived in Austria on Monday was also without great difficulty, Konrad said, praising the organizational "masterpiece".
The Ministry of the Interior, on the other hand, spoke of a "crisis situation".
In total, Konrad expects a demand of 85,000 units this year.
To meet the figure, 35,000 more shelters will need to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 to be provided by the countries, 15,000 by the federal government.
If there are more refugees, we can make it.
"But it's not a barrel without soil", said Conrad.
He's already had talks with the heads of state.
This would have ensured that he would also provide quarters for the coming refugees.
"It's going well in Upper Austria", said Ferry Maier.
The former vice president supports Konrad.
There will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn tomorrow to discuss how the Church will help.
The asylum coordinator also places high expectations on the ORF action "Helping like us".
The platform allows individuals to offer accommodation without complications.
And you're hoping for hotels that are empty in the winter.
Konrad and Maier yesterday criticized the standards for housing as "too high".
In emergency situations, quarters may not be required to maintain a certain height of the towel holder or the size of the headlamps.
For a limited period of time, 'emergency standards' should apply.
Konrad has been more successful in accommodation than the Ministry of the Interior.
I'm an elderly gentleman who doesn't get the lie out of his face.
Convincing is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier have declared that they are not costing the Republic.
They want to increase their number of employees to three to four.
My own neighborhood search has not been successful so far.
Konrad wanted to set up a container in Stephans Square as an office.
But there are obviously problems with the permit.
Linz calls for better distribution
For now, no city sports halls and other buildings such as the Tips Arena and Design Center are planned to be opened for refugees.
This is not necessary at the moment, as the people concerned can be accommodated without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
However, for the emergency, other sites are to be checked for their suitability.
The mayor is critical of the distribution of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts must also contribute to this.
Seehofer: "Border is not sealed"
In a lengthy telephone call with Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), the Head of State, Josef Pühringer (VP), agreed on Monday to take further action on the refugee issue.
Seehofer assured me that the German borders will not be sealed.
The continued movement of refugees to the Federal Republic is possible.
But it is the border checks that are in place.
Special trains with refugees to Germany will not be available for the time being.
However, asylum seekers would be taken to Germany by regular trains.
Mr Püring once again called on the other EU Member States to strengthen their solidarity with refugees.
The fact that Austria is now also introducing controls at its borders is a "logical consequence" for Püringer of the German approach.
The next runtastic is a matter of time
The general renovation of the "New Wharf" in the Linz industrial line has been officially completed.
The four six-storey office and production buildings are occupied by the publicly traded IT group S&T, the remaining (2700 m2) are to be leased to young, innovative technology companies.
"In IT, smart minds are our raw material - and we have to try to get them to work for us", says Hannes Niederhauser, head of S&T.
He could imagine investing in startups at the New Yard and later acquiring some.
From the very beginning, S&T has been working with the new neighbours - something that Niederhauser promises himself: "The next run-out is only a matter of time".
EUR 1.7 million was invested by S&T in the site, EUR 3.3 million by the Techcenter, which each belongs to a third of the city of Linz, the state of Upper Austria and the Federal Republic of Germany (FFG).
The building is leased by Linz AG to S&T and Techcenter for 60 years.
30% of the remaining 2,700 square metres of the building are already rented, and 40% are being requested.
Lia-Peroni owner opened a second store in the arcade
The new store is focused on Furla handbags.
Actually, Jutta Breit was trying to get a dog.
The 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in the dove market arcade had to put off the project for a short time, and it was finally expanded into another store.
In the Furla shop, opposite to the shop where she sells bags, suitcases, shoes and clothes from various manufacturers, everything now revolves around Furla brand women's handbags, wallets are from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
It's been a few weeks before.
"But I've been thinking for a long time about opening another store", says Breit.
The decision was influenced by the fact that furla producers in Bologna were also inspired by the idea of a separate shop where only their handbags were sold.
"We are the only ones in the Linz area who sell this brand", says the mother of two daughters, who herself has Italian roots.
Her fashion interests were widely planted by her mother.
I'm most comfortable when something is developing and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why such a woman is so displeased at the sight of a beautiful handbag, the expert can't answer with any certainty.
Maybe it's because a beautiful bag upsets every outfit.
The noise maker from Cold City
Donald Trump's pathetic ancestors came from a place whose inhabitants are called Angeber.
This trait is also associated with the billionaire who wants to become president of the United States.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for upsets.
Whether he speaks xenophobicly, calls journalists red or reveals gaps in international crisis politics, the candidate for the office of President of the United States is stirring up the election campaign.
And cut it well.
This is also recorded in the fake Cold City, where the billionaire's grandparents are from.
The New Yorker with the hair of a hairdresser is a term used by many in the wine-growing village on Wine Street.
Some in the 1,200-member town are related to him over the centuries.
His grandfather came from Cold City in the Palatinate, Donald Trump, here in campaign mode.
The call girl Simone Wendel was making a movie about Trump.
And what do the villagers think of his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find this exciting, but they're not so impressed with their Kallstad style", says Simone Wendel.
The native of Kallstädter has made a funny documentary about the place and its famous spruce, which includes the Heinz Ketchup family alongside Trump.
Trump, who is not known for his modesty, also makes a statement in "Kings of Cold City" (2014) - saying that he would certainly be successful if he lived in Cold City.
He didn't bring it to the King of Hearts.
While there is respect for the family's performance, there is also a tendency to think that Trump is "just a little big mouth", says Wendel.
Coincidentally, the nickname of the cold town in the vicinity was "The Noisy Makers" - in High German: the Provider, she says.
So Trump is from the village of the Anchor.
Trump's success story began in 1885, when his grandfather emigrated and opened a gold digging shop in the United States.
The cornerstone of the real estate company was the first real estate purchases in New York.
But the lives of the grandparents were not without tragedy: their desire to return to their homeland for good failed in the Bavarian state, to which the Palatinate belonged at the time.
He didn't take Trump because he ran away without permission, the director of the Institute for Forensic History and Folk Studies, Roland Paul, had said at the filming.
Trump is the grandson of an "illegal immigrant".
This contrasts with the sometimes stark statements of the descendant.
He had repeatedly spoken out against Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"The way he flirtes, it's not that nice", says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump.
The retired winegrower sees the American more distantly, "he's always so uptight".
Does he think Trump will come?
"I can't imagine that", says the 72-year-old.
"He never took care of Cold City".
Retired housekeeper Veronika Schramm, like many Calgary residents, mentions that a descendant of the Heinz family donated some for the church organ during a visit, which was generally well received.
"I can't imagine that from Donald", says the 68-year-old.
She would think it better if he didn't win the election because "he has such radical views, I don't know if that's good".
If those who were in command in the United States at his grandfather's time had been like him, "he would never have arrived".
"There are more interesting topics than this", says the winemaker's daughter, Sarah Bühler.
And as president?
"It's not my president", she says.
And, "The grapes will ripen without President Trump".
Wendell's film, for which Trump was interviewed for a long time, has been seen by 12,000 movie goers, and there's been interest in the United States, too.
The Upper Bavarian municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "mountain town".
The German Alpine Association's vice-president, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, awarded the 1800 inhabitants' village in the Berchtesgaden National Park on Wednesday the award for gentle tourism.
In Austria there are already 20 mountain climbing villages.
In the neighbouring country, the Alpine Association is responsible for awarding the award.
A 'mountain village' may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the ratings despite Nine's attempts to take over the loss of leadership on the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to Canberra to report on the loss of Liberal leadership, but it hasn't brought about any major changes in the ratings for Today.
Nine's breakfast show was broadcast from the state capitol when Malcolm Turnbull overthrew Tony Abbott.
Rivale Sunrise, with presenters David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was in London as part of a week-long series of international television shows including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of distance did not seem to matter to Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise averaged 397,000 viewers in the five capitals, compared to Today's 339,000.
Today achieved a slight increase over the ratings for Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its figure fell below that of last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap with Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, Today averaged 318,000 compared to Sunrise's 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has averaged 349,000 viewers, compared to 314,000 on Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for checking in!

The big news for Seven was the impressive 800-word debut with former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand reached a very impressive 1,219 million viewers.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could carry a hit solo show without the Rafter star Rebecca Gibney.
The results of last night answered this with a clear "yes".
Seven's X-Factor remained strong with 1.136 million viewers and slightly beat The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results on evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour of the new quiz show, hosted by Andrew O'Keefe, averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's hot seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half-hour of The Chase Australia drew 520,000 viewers and the second half-hour a whopping 720,000.
Hot seat average is 620,000.
The fall in the second-night ratings of The Chase Australia will convince Nine that Hot-Seat will finally prevail at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for the Million Dollar Minute that failed to top the McGuire show.

The last three are consistent: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man, but who will he choose?
A secret is revealed?
Lana Jeavons Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unknowingly revealed who wins The Bachelor.
The woman who ends up with Sam Wood in The Bachelor was kept a secret.
And none of the three remaining girls will tell us if she's the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons Fellows the day before we were three to two, you may have accidentally given a hint of who the winner will be.
Sam Wood keeps his lips tight until the final on Thursday.
All three women lyrically spoke out about why Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values, and positive attitudes as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked, "If not you, who should get Woods' last rose?" their answers could become the game-winner who won the bachelor's heart.
Jeavons Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as Wood's best partner, except for themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship from day one.
"From the moment I went into the house and noticed (Sarah's) and Sam's energies, I felt they were pretty compatible, and I thought about that throughout the show", Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet, it's so much fun to be with her", Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood would be a good match.
From her point of view, Mackay said that the house visit last week made it clear to her that Wood could be "the one".
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this obviously wasn't just a game - I'm totally set on him now", she said.
And when she was asked who Wood should choose, if not her, she was puzzled.
"I don't know if I can say that", she said.
I love the other girls equally - it's a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor is on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after he moved to the U.S. - and there were many other teams sending requests after his impressive open practice day late last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and it looks like a smart decision.
Some coaches have banished Hayne for the rest of the game when he lost a fight, as did the Aussie rugby league convertible in his first punt return on Tuesday in a 20-3 win over Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next chance to return to punt and also to the game after an injury to Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of kicking his rookies through the mill before the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly reinforced Hayne in his post-game press conference.
49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his spoiled catch and focus on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne patching a punt restored in the first quarter by the Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the start Hayne and his massive Australian following had hoped for for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the field after the fumbling, cursing, and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he couldn't imagine a worse start to his NFL career,
"That was a thing that happens now, you just care about the next game, and that's it", Hayne said.
Hayne compared the scorer to his Origin debut back in 2007, when a pass in his own in-goal area led to a try for Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans, holding an Australian flag after the game, and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested on a Siberian roller coaster with gunfire.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos confiscated and his democratic efforts blocked.
The free electorate demands the hiring of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high refugee numbers.
Party and faction leader Hubert Aiwanger warned at the start of the FW autumn clause in Großwallstadt of a serious crisis in Bavaria's schools when there are no new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools from collapsing", Aiwanger said.
"Otherwise we will get a miscarriage of justice in the Bavarian education system".
The Free Voters' Landtag faction is meeting until Friday in the Lower Frankic commune.
In fact, there were quite different main themes.
But the record number of refugees now dominates the Free Voter's Meeting.
"Of course, the asylum issue will overwhelm the clause", Aiwanger said.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as they were during the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s.
"This is not the way forward, we must address the causes", said the Free Voters' Chief.
Refused asylum seekers want to push the free electorate away as quickly as possible.
Aiwanger also requested more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum claims: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges", Aiwanger said.
The FW chief criticised several federal states for not being consistent: "We need federal standards that are uniform across the country".
"Bavaria is moving, others are not".
"We need to be more proactive".
But the country's politics in the big city should not be under the table.
A longstanding issue remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, Minister for Culture Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) has launched the pilot "Middle level plus" at 47 secondary schools, which tests an extension of the secondary level from three to four years - resulting in nine years of graduation.
But Aiwanger is not going far enough.
"The G9 issue must be accelerated", said the FW chief.
We demand freedom of choice for all high schools that want it.
Free to drive anywhere you want at the G9.
Wall Street is getting stronger , Dax is getting started .

Four people killed after police fired rubber shots at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber shots at a crowd protesting against the proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence broke out on Tuesday night in Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the district's chief official, said that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station, some throwing stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
He said 20 police and five civilians were wounded.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets used, which are known to kill but traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high mortality rate.
The dispute was the latest in weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Tharus, who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent clashes since the 10th.
The first is the fact that the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces, an important step towards a new constitution, but a highly controversial issue in Nepal, which has been governed centrally for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
Lawmakers voted this week on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu, and officials have said the new constitution could come into force on Sunday.
Planned construction site in the city
The land at the Emder Youth Centre Old Post is to be redeveloped.
The city is currently preparing everything for the sale of the 4,000-square-meter site.
A mix of trade, commerce and housing is planned, but there are no concrete offers yet.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to sell a 4,000-square-foot property in the immediate vicinity of the Old Post Youth Centre.
The preparations for this are currently underway.
The site is planned to be used for a mix of commercial, commercial and residential use.
The city says they're waiting for an offer.
The investor in question is not yet clear.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should be able to take a decision on the application of the new rules.
The city of Emden had bought a part of the land on Ringstraße/Eckstraße just a few months ago and demolished the building on it.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
Plans for a holiday home at the Little Sea near Emden are taking shape.
The investor first publicly presented plans for the project.
Many people are still worried about the sale of their recreational shelter
For months, negotiations, debates and drafts had been held behind closed doors.
Now the plans for a new holiday home by the Little Sea near Emden are on the table.
The interested party, the SMEs' firm System-Bu, presented its plans to the public for the first time at the City Development Committee of the EMCDDA Council on Monday evening.
The Commission has already decided to take a decision on the proposal for a directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the marketing of certain goods.
Under pressure from project critics and the FDP faction, who accused investors and management of secrecy, Ralf Behrends of the System-Bu management team went on the offensive: "We don't have an answer to all questions yet", he told the council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it's good to be able to face all the rumors now.
The project, which will cost between 10 and 12 million euros, has been under discussion for months.
The images and new details of the desired hotel construction were evoked by the strong reactions of the sea-farm owners who had come to the meeting.
Roberto Schulz, owner of a sea-building and board member at the interests agency Pro Hieve, complains: "This is a giant cottage that surpasses all other buildings".
He also fears, like many other project critics, that the planned size of the plant will increase traffic significantly: "There must be full busloads to make this happen", Schulz said.
However, what is happening on the well-known one-acre site of the former inn is still open.
There's no operator yet.
"We must first have a definite concept", said Ralf Behrends.
The Commission has not yet adopted any proposals for the extension of the existing infrastructure.
Twin cubs with gorillas at the Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is pleased to see young gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian gave birth to twins yesterday.
Twin births are rare in gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo was almost 50 years ago and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, the zoo says.
The sex of the newborn gorilla twins is still uncertain, as Mother Dian has held them close to her body so far.
First, the picture reported.
NHC predicts a 60 percent chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde
The U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday that a wide low pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verdean islands has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours.
Another well-defined low-pressure system, such as in the middle between the Cape Peninsula and the Lesser Antilles, also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical cyclone in the next two days, the Miami-based weather experts added.
Google is launching a double-donation campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced a double-spending campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have been displaced by the European nations as they flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach to announcing the donation call on its blog.
Instead of letting a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven, wrote about her personal experiences.
"Our journey included many dark train and bus journeys, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear", she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe grows, many people like my family are desperately looking for help.
The donations go to four non-profit organizations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said the first global donations raised up to a value of 5.5 million on google.com/refugeerelief will double to $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria that displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many have also fled war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For diabetics who are slightly overweight, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study.
It's too early to tell whether people who are slightly overweight with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data takes a long time to show something", said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations, or obesity surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity operations have proven effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted in people who are morbidly obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain measure of weight in relation to size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI of over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data they collected in a 2007 study comparing two types of obesity surgery - gastric bypass and gastric tubing - to treat type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI of those who underwent this surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of this study.
Meanwhile, BMI for those receiving non-surgical diabetes treatments remained about the same at 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36 percent had complete and 28 percent partial diabetes.
In the medical group, diabetes resolved completely at only one percent and partially at only about two percent.
In addition, the results of blood pressure, triglyceride and "bad" LDL cholesterol controls were "generally better in the 'surgical' group", the authors found.
The researchers also monitored patients' blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
H1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After the operation, the average hemoglobin A1c level dropped from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, the medical therapy group remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this improved "glycemic control" - as reflected in the improved hemoglobin A1c levels - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results for the two types of surgery.
By the fifth year, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg) compared to the gastrectomy group, achieved greater declines in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1 vs. 2.1%) and were more likely to have a complete overcoming of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study shows no survival benefit from surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life span, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent an obesity operation were about 29 percent less likely to die within 15 years - compared with a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no survival benefit for surgical patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for people with a BMI of less than 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"That's the critical point of this study, because it says this surgery is lower in this lower BMI group", without an increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient has a BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long to get people to take this seriously", she said.
I think once they've accumulated these genetic changes that have tied their bodies to obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really hard".
Love story is set in the back of the hump
It is a subject that is currently receiving increasing attention in the fine arts: A young woman, unpopular and unattractive during school, meets the flock of her youth after years, and they fall in love with her.
So, in the recent novel "We're Not That Way" by Luisa Binder.
Beyond the love story, the novel is likely to be of interest to readers who are bored, especially since it is set in bored towns and villages.
The author grew up in boredom and is happy to have been able to set up a literary monument in her hometown.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe cannot accommodate all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to the violence in the refugees' home countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies.
He demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that while the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, the situation is not adequate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe", he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to take care of several thousand refugees, but in the meantime you have to think about long-term solutions to create real peace and real development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries", he stressed.
Finally, we must think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must reduce the use of force.
"The use of force has never solved these problems", he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush's actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, pointing out that the US' violent response was a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I wrote a letter of condolences to President Bush and told him that the way to solve this problem is through nonviolence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and it has produced unexpected consequences", the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in children's use of hand sanitizers in the last four years
Poison control centers in the United States report a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 who ingest heavily alcoholic hand sanitizers, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, the incidence of hand sanitizer intake among children under 12 years of age, as reported by the Centers for Disease Control, increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Kids are coming to these products more and more often, and unfortunately a percentage of them land in the emergency room", Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectants deliberately, while others do so to impress their friends or for a social media test of courage.
Videos on YouTube show teenagers drinking disinfectants just for a cheap experience.
Teenagers reportedly mixed disinfectants with alcoholic mouthwash to obtain a harder drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the attractive scents of disinfectants.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for it", Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand sanitizers) are those that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grapefruit and orange scents that are very appealing to children.
Hand sanitizers contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, few sprays can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol", said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Poison Emergency Center at the University of Kansas Hospital, on Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So you wouldn't leave a sip of whiskey around, but people leave these hand sanitizers at the reach of children, and when children get to them, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four syringes of strawberry-flavored hand sanitizer at school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179 times higher than the legal threshold for an adult to be drunk, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency physician who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was shouting her words and was unable to walk when she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors were monitoring her overnight in a separate children's hospital for signs of brain trauma, as the girl had fallen from the alcohol and hit her head, Ritchey said.
"That was very scary", Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal to my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or disinfectant towels and to store hand sanitizers outside the child's reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after ingesting hand sanitizers containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a lethal solution, instead of ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-graders in New York State planned to poison their "common" teacher by placing antibacterial products around the classroom", reports a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand sanitizers and banished her from her room.
The police considered the failed plan a "spoke" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
In a road accident at the crossroads between North Ring and On Herdenen, a 33-year-old driver was slightly injured in a road accident.
A 60-year-old truck driver was driving at the intersection towards a traffic zone and noticed too late that two front-runners had stopped at the traffic.
Then he hit the back of an Audi with his truck and pushed it against a Ford Fiesta standing in front of it.
The damage to the vehicles involved in the accident was estimated at EUR 10 000, the police said.
The 33-year-old's Audi was no longer ready to drive and had to be towed.
Rumor has it that Celtic is not a disorder.
Griffiths's playing down the dissonance at Celtic Glasgow, Deila admits the Hoops are in a bad place, but he's gonna turn that around again.
Hearts will fight SFA over Neilson's allegations and Warburton will be cautious about January's new commitments that could destroy the unity of the cadre.
Don's up the lead over Celtic by five points.
Adam Rooney's eleven metres in the first half gave Aberdeen a close victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie, allowing the Dons to create a five-point gap between them and Celtic.
Griffiths plays down disarmony talk
There are rumors of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which Griffiths spontaneously rejected, insisting that he and his teammates are not under increased control as they prepare for the confrontation with the Dutch leader.
I don't think we're feeling under any pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football is boring the Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Netherlands national player Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic as there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an Ajax ambassador, said: "They don't show any Celtic highlights in Holland anymore and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't here.
People here aren't just talking about the Rangers coming back.
You're talking about the old firm.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of excitement in the old-fashioned games, and it's not just people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'll turn things around, I swear to God.
Ronnie Deila has accepted that Celtic must fight, but the Norwegian boss has vowed to turn things around.
After the defeat of Malmö and the subsequent exit from the Champions League, the defeat of 10 men from Aberdeen followed, who now have a clear five-point lead at the top of the table.
Deila said, "Celtic has had bad times before, and we'll come back".
Now we want to get out of there as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel that way, but we have to move on.
We really, really need Celtic's support because it makes the players better.
It's so important to stand together now.
Warburton, be careful with January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago suggesting he was attracting some January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is careful when signing new entrants and insists he doesn't want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox cadre.
The former Brentford manager said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window".
The players who come in the summer have this preseason time to integrate what you've seen with our own group this season.
The team's really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target Michu with a withdrawal order
Swansea striker Michu, in a conversation with Celtic during the transfer window, has indicated he could withdraw when his contract with the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old has been suffering from a troublesome ankle for two years and has not made it out of Wales this summer.
Hearts on SFA battle ground over Neilson's comments
The Hearts led 2:1 when Paterson was sent off the field and then lost 3:2, but the defender's red card was later revoked - Collum's third red card, which was revoked in eight months.
Neilson keeps what he said, insisting, "I didn't question integrity, I didn't comment on performance".
Griffiths swore to avoid Tynecastle
The unrectifiable hibee was reprimanded after admitting to singing a song with offensive lyrics about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh, in front of an Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a Derby, and it was the heat of the moment", said the striker, adding: "It is safe to say that I will not return to Tynecastle unless it plays for Celtic Glasgow".
Tannadice's board of directors has confidence in Dundee United's management
Simon Donnelly insists that the Dundee United board still has confidence in the management team to turn things around - but admits that the decline must end on the pitch.
I think Stephen Thompson has faith in us.
We're gonna get the boys back on track", Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy to win against Hamilton "unfairly".
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen side had to fight desperately against Hamilton Accies to see a seventh consecutive league win, which gave them a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's eleven metres in the first half.
McInnes said, "There's no team that's won everything, in cup games or leagues, that hasn't even won games like this".
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged, while in the United Kingdom it is rising overall.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of unemployed people in the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland of 5.9 percent was above the UK's of 5.5 percent, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile employment in Scotland fell by 12 000 during the three months, with the number of employees now at 2.612 000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent over the quarter, above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
Scotland's Secretary of State, David Mundell, commented on the latest figures and said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy".
It's been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment.
Drunk people disrupted the flow
Since the security personnel could not appease the situation, the staff called the police.
Only with pepper spray could the officers detain the intruders.
A breathing alcohol test in a 16-year-old gave 0.89 promille.
The baby was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 promille and was initially held in custody.
Why I'm gonna witness an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I'm gonna watch a man be put to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting in an audience gallery in the death chamber at Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation came first in January, through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day drew nearer, I began to fear.
So why would I?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It's true that journalists are allowed to watch executions in the United States, and as there are often more applications than seats available, a macabre lottery is held to decide who gets elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media posts from 12 to five.
Whoever gets elected will watch it emotionally.
I can't do that.
I'm going to sit next to Richard Glossips' best friend, with whom I've developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like this guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a pencil to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A reporter from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of abandoning my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he wants it to, and you'll get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "could have put it better", but she still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had trouble with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did.
I told him he could remove me from his witness list anytime.
But he wants an international reporter present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks that public relations will help the death penalty movement.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will be sitting next to me.
If you want to know more about this case, please listen to the podcast series I made.
I don't want to go into all the details here.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the act.
But I think there's a strong likelihood that he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from that perspective, I'm going to see him die.
I can't say I'm really objective.
There will be other reporters you can reach out to.
What you're gonna get from me is what it's like to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man after wet police chase convinced to come from the Canning River
The Canning Vale cop was dry when he talked the Canning River man into it.
An attempt by a Perth man to hang the police was unsuccessful when he found himself in the shallow, swampy waters, just a few feet from a police officer who tried to "smoothly persuade him to return to the shore".
Canning Vale police were called to a home invasion incident in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them towards the Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water and said, 'I can't get out, come and get me,' said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too keen on getting his uniform wet, so he used a more reliable tactic - "A good cop negotiates".
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape", said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
World champion soccer player Ben Cousins is an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into the trenches to avoid a drunken check and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but he inspired locals to plan a humorous Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to end the race
Peter Moody claims that Racing Victoria stewards tried to install a spy in his stalls last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He targeted the stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed they were running a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai over a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he's always tried to do what's best for racing and he found himself in difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt test at Lidaris, which he can't explain.
He had held back 18 months on espionage charges and didn't want it to "look like grapes hanging too high".
"I was going to say nothing about it, and I sat on it for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything comes out all at once", Moody said.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm going home tonight and I'm going to sleep well.
I want to walk around with raised heads, and I want my owners to think I'm doing my best for them.
If they start thinking I'm not doing this, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I'll have to think about what I'm gonna do with my license.
Earlier, Moody had dropped the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I'll name when asked - and offered him employment in my stalls to provide information about what I do inside my stalls", Moody told Racing.com.
You seem to think I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, they should definitely grab their noses because they failed to grab me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, acting president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and are still aware of it today.
Is this supposed to make me think it's personal?
Has the RVL been cowardly and perhaps making people outside the coaching staff responsible for what's going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think it's me.
Maybe they'll have to take my license and dump me, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying is gonna make her think about it now.
But I've reached a point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
It really makes me sad.
I'm going to put pressure on them and push them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The coach's frustration levels have built up with Lidari's long-running cobalt investigation, and the late scratching led him to say he could "throw his license over the table".
Moody, best known for his preparation of the undefeated Black Caviar, called the race day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horses' legs, which violated the rules.
"It's against the rules of racing.
I must take full responsibility for this", he said.
"One of my employees mistakenly put mud on his leg.
It could have been last night.
It could have been like this all day yesterday, whatever it was.
It was like that on race day.
Moody could face a three-month disqualification from the packaging treatment on race day.
It's a joke, you know.
People who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all realize we need rules, but we've gone too far", Moody said.
Man arrested for driving under the influence
Police arrested a man over the weekend after a collision with a cyclist and subsequent driver's escape in Cobram.
The cyclist was taken to the Royal Melbourne Hospital in a helicopter with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley motorway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver continued without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia turned himself in to police in Shepparton.
He's expected to be charged with vehicular homicide and aiding and abetting and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in hospital in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy backs down against rivals over ring-fighting allegations
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has described criticism of tackling his players as "agendasetting" two Premier League favourites of the NRL.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed the Storm players to "ring-fight" with his team during the high-scoring Storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a hardly concealed remark to the Storm team after his team scored the final victory over the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, calling the game a "pattern example" of rugby league, saying the two from Queensland were not "too good" in the ring.
Bellamy defended his team's tackling and said they were only focused on their "contact" when tackling.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two top coaches on his team was confident because it meant they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
"It keeps popping up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about ring fights when they beat us 24:2", Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee we haven't changed anything about our defensive system or our techniques all year, but in the last six weeks, we've made our contact with tackles a real focus, and that's what's turned the tide for us.
Trent's been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to coach, so he's probably not used to losing, so it was a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how this happens all the time this season.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night to our game on Friday night and how exciting their game was", Bellamy said.
I remember back in 2010, St. George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he was gonna take a shit about it.
But now he has a team that can play and we find it exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
That's the ball game you want to play when you have that kind of players.
He made that statement in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play his type of football -- not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like this.
I'm building more confidence because they say these things because they're a little worried about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us when it came to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the Storm game against the Roosters scored a higher score than the Broncos game against the Cowboys.
The Broncos game was a good one, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the result?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more tries in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or is taking breaks and not getting points exciting?
For me, it's the game plan.
When they mention us, it means we'll meet them at some point.
The Storm team is off this weekend, as they've won the right to host either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the pre-final at AAMI Park next Saturday night.
Serbian with $ 200,000 bail for drug charges
A man who could face life imprisonment for trying to smuggle 40 kilograms of cocaine into Queensland has been released on $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after federal police found 100 kg of drugs on the Solay yacht that came over Vanuatu from South America and was docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen meeting his co-defendants at the marina during the morning and later at the Coomera Roadhouse Café, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a possible life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he was attempting to possess the entire quantity and that the cafe could have been for a harmless reason.
The Supreme Court judge, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the risk of escape from Maksimovic.
He has clear ties to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia", he told the court on Wednesday.
He lied to the police about where he was in the criminal case.
Maksimov's mother and stepfather had offered him $200,000 in bail to secure his release.
"After reading the affidavits of the two individuals, it is clear that the imposition of a $200,000 security is a real financial burden", said Judge Flanagan.
But that alone will not be enough to keep him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released on bail on the condition that he surrender his Australian and Serbian passports, report to the police daily and abide by a 6:00-6:00 curfew.
Accident on the A5 near Karlsruhe: Führerhaus is torn apart
In a three-truck accident on Highway 5 near Karlsruhe, a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday night.
Two of the three trucks involved had brake ahead of a construction site heading towards Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried to avoid the left at the last moment, police said.
The driver's cab was completely torn apart.
The driver was taken to a hospital with serious injuries.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe North was completely closed for six hours until 2 a.m.
The damage was EUR 122.000.
Stevan Hogg used girls' phones to lure pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to request images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone while she was asleep, logged into an online messaging service, from which he received a series of indecent pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of sleeping Hogg.
She looked through it, found the confusing reports, and immediately alerted her mother.
The police took care of it, looked at the five images, then analyzed the computers found under the address and discovered "relevant" web searches that used terms to look for indecent images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he did it because it would "lead to pedophiles on the Internet" and then he "pretended to be a cop to scare them".
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court, "He said it was an addiction, that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that the computer searches were done by him, but said it was because he claimed to be a cop to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos.
He said he did it to lure her.
He said he was mentally ill when he drank, and he said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was trembling and crying.
She then saw the indecent images on the phone and confronted the accused with them.
The girl was interviewed and said that the accused used a computer and a PlayStation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to the charge of taking indecent pictures of children on 14 June last year, breaching the order on 25 January this year and failing to appear in court for a hearing on 24 March this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to appear on the sex offender register, as it could be argued that "no significant sexual element" was to be found in his crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael has postponed the sentencing until October to get background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted bail in this case but was detained for questioning on other pending cases.
He was listed on the sex offender registry before the date of the trial.
Locks are switched off at small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being taken away from the main checkpoints on the German-Austrian border.
Many locksmiths, afraid of being discovered and arrested, left more people at smaller border crossings
"We're going to the Austrian side", said a spokesman for the Federal Police.
More than 1,000 refugees have been taken in the counties of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They had reached the German side on foot over bridges and dusty hills.
They are picked up by federal police and sent to register.
According to German police reports, on Wednesday, the number of refugees arrived at the Munich Central Station was significantly higher than at the beginning of the week.
By 8:00 a.m. alone, about 700 people had arrived in the state capital, a spokesman said this morning.
After the re-establishment of controls at the German-Austrian border, 1759 refugees arrived in the city on Tuesday.
Stuttgart: Tropical Storm Henry expected to blow southwest
Meteorologists are warning of storm surges in the southwest from Wednesday afternoon.
The German weather service (DWD) in Stuttgart reported that warm sea air is currently flowing into the country due to a low pressure area over Western Europe.
The strongest depth was the outbreak of the tropical storm Henry, which had been swept across the Atlantic from the Bermuda Islands in recent days.
Heavy storms and thunderstorms are expected mainly in Baden.
According to DWD, the black forest, the Swabian Alb and the Gulf of Constance are still expected to have a bowl of 60 to 90 km/h until Thursday morning.
So you can see the sun again on Friday.
The masses are doing it: every two years, the automakers show their innovations at the IAA.
In 2015, the movement of compact cars is particularly strong, which are currently selling particularly well.
The compact cars are currently in particular demand: around 28.1% of new licences were in this segment in August alone, according to the Federal Motor Vehicle Agency (FMA).
This is also reflected in the IAA (public day 17 to 27 September).
Between all the futuristic concept cars and the new high-end and luxury cars, this year will be marked by many new compact models.
One of the biggest premieres for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra, which will be available to dealers in the autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us", Opel chief Karl-Thomas Neumann said at the trade fair.
It's the core of the brand.
The new Astra is not expected to be much more expensive to sell the volume model.
Opel is looking to enter a step below its biggest competitor, Volkswagen Golf, which starts at 17 650 euros.
The current Astra costs from 16 990 euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4-liter engine with 74 kW/100 hp.
In addition, Hessen will offer additional diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 PS to 147 kW//200 PS, including three-cylinder petrol engines for the first time.
Unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is initially only available as a five-door sedan.
The second variant will be the next in the spring, which is also on display at the IAA.
And what else is going on at the IAA in addition to the Astra?
Renault Megane: Renault is sending the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mégane into the race.
The Megane is exclusively available as a five-door in a conventional and sporty GT version.
It'll be on the market early next year, then as a van.
Infiniti: The newest in the segment is the Infiniti Q30.
The Nissan-owner wants to find its position in the fast-growing segment with the new model.
The compact Infiniti, with its curved lines, fits the design line of the brand.
The basic model will have a petrol engine with a power output of at least 90 kW/122 hp.
However, there is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 hp on offer.
Suzuki Baleno: The newest in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, which is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-litre turbo engine with a power output of 82 kW/111 hp.
The maximum torque is 170 Newton metres (Nm), as specified by the manufacturer.
The sale of the Baleno in Europe will start in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not entirely new, but roundly updated is the compact DS 4 model, which is on display at the IAA.
The designers of the luxury Citroën outdoor lighthouse were primarily hand-painted on the front: the cooling grill was redesigned and the modified headlights were equipped with LED technology.
The interior has been upgraded to include the infotainment system, a touchscreen button reduction and the first Apple CarPlay integration.
In addition, the IAA will be presenting a number of revisions and new variants in the compact class, such as the refreshed Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square metres of cell are unworthy of man
The Federal Constitutional Court granted a judgment to a former prisoner of the Tegel Correctional Institution who had been held in a too small cell for months.
In principle, because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are entitled to financial compensation when they are placed in too small cells.
The Federal Constitutional Court decided in a decision published on Wednesday.
The judges said that the victims could hope for money even if they had been locked up in the confines for only a few days.
Thus, a former prisoner successfully lodged his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: he was housed in the Berlin-Tegel judicial penitentiary between June and November 2009 in a single cell with a floor area of about five square meters; the toilet was not spaciously separated.
After that, the man, who, according to his lawyer, is now free again, had been moved to a larger cell.
His civil action for imprisonment of the Berlin State was unsuccessful.
However, the Constitutional Court reversed the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court and referred the case back to the court for further consideration.
You see the human dignity of man being violated.
The Court of Appeal will now decide on the amount of compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, only a few days' imprisonment for the period in question were relevant for compensation, a claim for compensation was granted.
Otherwise, "a rule of law protecting the personality would be to be feared".
The court of appeals must now decide the amount of the monetary compensation.
The constitutional courts have strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past.
So they did not award damages until April to a prisoner because he was locked up naked in a cell.
A 2011 decision also found that multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet is unfit for human consumption.
In addition, Karlsruhe confirmed Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had certified a prisoner of inhuman and degrading treatment in a parallel case in November 2009.
The applicant was then confined for three months between 15 and 21 hours a day in a cell similar to that in the Karlsruhe case.
Berlin prisons have also made headlines in recent weeks because of a lack of staff.
The situation is therefore continuing to be so that prisoners are kept in solitary confinement for 23 hours, and the aggression is increasing, even in the face of the tense situation.
According to the Justice Press Agency, 21 jobs in Tegel are not filled due to youth shortages, 19 are due to be lost in 2016.
Angela Merkel and refugee policy: "We can do this"
The immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What's going on in Germany?
The German Federal Ministry of the Interior estimates that around 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, and Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) says Germany is even able to take in one million refugees.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) expressed her determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: we can do this, and we will do it".
The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to Germany:
The projected annual demand for housing is between 350000 (estimated by the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (estimated by the Pestel Institute) for the next five years.
This is almost twice the amount of homes being built (2500,000).
The lack of housing is dramatic, but above all in the case of affordable rental properties: every year between 60000 and 80 000 social housing units are excluded from the rental price, and refugees will also apply for these particularly cheap housing units.
The Federal Minister for Building, Barbara Hendricks (SPD), therefore wants to double the funding, from 518 million to one billion euros.
The Pestel Institute is not quite sure what to expect: 80 000 social housing units would have to be built annually, and the Federal Government would have to invest 6.4 billion a year in this area.
Scientists and the Federal Ministry of Housing agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in housing.
The Institute for Labour Market and Vocational Research estimates that in the long term, 55 per cent of refugees in Germany can be employed.
However, refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them enter, criticises Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.
The main thing that is crucial for the integration of refugees is whether they find work in Germany.
Work is key to social contacts, to appreciation in the host society, but also to immigrants' self-esteem, says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
In Germany, according to Thränhardt, there has been a political shift from a ban on work for refugees to recognition of work.
While there was previously a ban on work for asylum seekers of up to five years, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as was the residence requirement, which limited asylum seekers to one place of residence.
The view that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly has been largely promoted in society, even because of the shortage of skilled workers.
A major obstacle to access to the labour market is a lack of German.
There is no sufficient supply of general and vocational language courses so far.
Research also shows that jobs are most often provided through personal contacts.
The creation of networks is therefore, in Thränhardt's view, the royal road to labour integration.
The Berlin school board found that few refugee parents put their children in the kites, an estimated 10 to 15 percent: "For the uprooted parents, it is very important to keep the family together", says Ilja Koschembar, spokeswoman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration.
Nevertheless, to convince the family of the benefits of the cat, the administration distributes leaflets in various languages.
If the need for female educators were to increase sharply due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacity - for example by allowing more vocational schools.
In the countries, students without German are prepared for classes in welcome classes.
However, they are not always taught by fully qualified teachers, but, as in Berlin, by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers of the Berlin school board.
The German Student Union estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no federal state bans asylum seekers or patients from studying - the only exception to this is Berlin, but Innensenator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now given up.
The European Union has also made a number of proposals for a new framework for the implementation of the European Community's external relations policy.
Because refugees with a residence permit or allowance will no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Seeker Benefit Act when they start their studies.
The latter are not generally entitled to a baffle, as they do not fall within the circle of persons entitled to a baffle.
Patient refugees must have lived in Germany for four years before being eligible for Bafög, and from 1 January 2016 this period is reduced to 15 months.
The Commission has also proposed a new programme for the European Community to be launched in the coming years.
The students should get a baby bowl right away.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should successively grant Islam the same rights as churches and develop the existing state-church law into a new state-religion relationship.
It would also be important to set up an Islamic welfare association that would care professionally for the newcomers.
The right also includes obligations.
The representatives of Islam must therefore agree on clear contacts and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and to allow it certain controls.
This includes a willingness to take a heartfelt stand against religious fundamentalism.
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could be brought into Germany.
Those who wanted to bring about such conflicts in Germany "have immediately exercised their right to stay here in Germany", he told Bayer's Radio.
He proposed translating the Basic Law into Arabic.
Integration will be a much more social issue in the future than it is today.
The majority society will also have to change, and the elimination of discrimination and racism will become more urgent.
Germany has, as a result of European decisions, for almost a decade had an anti-discrimination body and a general equality law.
But it's learning very slowly, as the NSU serial murders showed, where the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: what migration organisations and non-white German interest groups have long demanded and what international agreements such as the Anti-Racism Convention commit Germany to must become a reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens use their opportunities - for the good of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical care for the refugees so far expected, says Dr. Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"As far as manpower and capacity are concerned, we can do this", he told the Daily Mirror.
However, it would require additional money to flow into the system.
To avoid any inconvenience, Montgomery urges all arrivals to give out health cards immediately upon registration.
The benefits received could be later settled with the Länder.
And in the long run, it is highly questionable to feed so many people with the limited benefits provided for in the Asylum Law.
Otherwise, doctors are primarily responsible for creating language barriers.
The Berlin-based health scientist Thea Borde has already shown that migrants are less educated about their diseases than other patients.
Not only in hospitals, but also in medical practices, interpretation costs should be taken into account, she asserts.
Many refugees would have been helped by more general medical services in emergency rooms.
And with a different diagnostic look.
For example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities among refugee children and HIV education among young people.
Montgomery believes that the German doctors were clear about their training in the other forms of illness.
"Parasitic infections or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect". And as for the lack of doctors, the refugees may even be looking for relief.
The Syrians have a highly developed education system, and many of the refugees are even doctors.
However, in order to be admitted to practice, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take further examinations.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are estimated by the German Federal Chamber of Psychotherapists (BPtK) to be mentally ill: most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
The report also highlights the importance of the role of the European Union in the fight against poverty.
A recent study by the TU Munich shows that one in five Syrian refugee children arrives in Germany traumatized.
Those who suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder suffer from so-called flashbacks, including shortness of breath, dizziness, heart attacks and fear of death.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, severe panic attacks, and emotional numbness.
To prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment is necessary, Munz explained.
But so far, only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy in social services, the process usually takes several months.
In addition, social workers or doctors who are not trained in mental health issues would often decide whether therapy is necessary or not.
This often leads to miscalculations, Munz says.
Many are invited to dream
With the new production "Passion", Circus Probst draws on the traditions of circus art.
The aim is to capture all ages with fascinating acrobatics, animal touch and unique entertainment.
Now the circus invites Probst into the routine on the brick wall to dream.
"Our passion is the circus".
"I can't imagine living without my circus family", says Stephanie Probst, a veterinary teacher and junior chef.
"Suffering" - under this motto is the current manegranate.
For over 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the Probst family.
So the gift of enthusiasm is in the blood of the family.
"It is important to us to get people out of their everyday lives and take them to a completely different world for two hours", says the 27-year-old junior principal.
"Many cocktails with world city flair", so calls director Reinhard Probst his concept.
50 cities on the nearly 3,000-kilometer tour can now experience this flair.
The circus' program is a convincing one with talented artists from all over the world.
Awarded at the Monte Carlo International Circus Festival, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family captivates the audience with wit and charm.
The Castillo Brothers understand their craft too.
The Cuban duo wants to take it easy with the heroes of the silent movies.
Ease and mobility - these are the words they identify with.
Your humorous art on the mast is to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
In addition to numerous salmon salves, the acrobatics of the circus also fascinate with finger-pointing and jointing.
Balance with the wheel on a ball?
He Yuan is not a problem.
Snake people fascinate and frighten at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics like few others and fascinated by its mobility.
60 employees from 12 nations offer diversity in every way.
"The animals are part of our family", says Stephany's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Circus animal behaviour disorders are all too often a concern among various animal protection organisations.
Stephanie Probst also comments: "If our animals are not well, we are not well".
About 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each stroke.
The "four-legged artists", as they are affectionately called, are read out of sight whenever possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal is not comfortable, it will not be in the way.
So the ultimate commandment is to take good care of the animals.
Especially on their Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a Shetland Pony Hound and a Zebra Stallion, the Probst family is proud.
The two animals have lived together in a fence for eight years and nothing happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little jumbo was there", says Brigitte Probst.
The zebroid is not ready for maneuver yet, but it's the only mascot of the circus probst.
So there should be something for every visitor.
"One thing is for sure", says Stephanie Probst, "whether it's five or 1,200 people, we always do our best and we're wholeheartedly there".
The Circus Probst invites you to its performances every day from 17 to 20 September at 5pm and 8pm.
On Sunday, the program begins at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.
Thursday is family day, and the show at 5 p.m. is discounted.
The zoo is also open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Zimbabwean Robert Mugabe is making a false speech in Parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down a flight of stairs from a podium earlier this year.
He was unharmed, but the video of the incident quickly spread on social media.
The opening of Parliament was also tarnished by claims by opposition MPs that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned not to accompany Mr Mugabe's speech with a buzzer.
Last month they had taken advantage of him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) spokesman Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on their phones warning them not to interfere with Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The news comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'Death,'" he told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members concerned that their immunity in Parliament is ending and that once they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity will no longer be effective.
The chief spokesman said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "concerned" about the dangers to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of the restructuring and service savings efforts.
HP will split into two publicly traded companies later this year, separating the computer and printer business from its fast-growing enterprise hardware and service business.
The expected job cuts will result in a burden of over $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard enterprise", said Meg Whitman, HP's chairman and chief executive, who will lead the unit after the split.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that support companies in the transition to a new style of business", Whitman said.
As a standalone company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has annual sales of more than $50 billion and "will be focused on providing enterprise-grade, integrated technology solutions that have not been achieved to date", the company said in a statement.
It divides a company founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical systems, and whose Palo Alto garage they called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to cope with the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The measure by HP, the world's second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US tech companies, is the latest in this area, based on the belief that tightly focused companies perform better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must stand behind injured Jack Wilshere before the game against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger told Wilshere that it was only September and that if his rehabilitation is going according to plan, there is no reason why he can't play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and given his history, his participation in the European Championship next summer is still uncertain.
The big shame about this current problem is that Wilshere had finished last season strong after a separate ankle injury and then returned to his old momentum during preseason.
"This kind of injury doesn't threaten your career", Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
It's not a big deal.
This was just an accident.
It wasn't related to his ankles or any injuries he'd had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the associated risk of further injury whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The investigation by Premier Injuries Ltd records 23 different illnesses of Wilshere since his debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games in the last five seasons.
The bigger picture for Arsenal is that in six of the eight seasons since 2007/08 they have been one of the two Premier League clubs to have the most injury days.
Wenger accepts the potential for a vicious cycle, but Arsenal believes an improvement in injury rates will continue over the past season.
"Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain combat strength", Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get through this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm confident he will, and he will have a career the way he deserves.
Arsenal will begin their Champions League season on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb ahead of games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, and Wenger will set up a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be on the road.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and give the players who need a little snoring break", Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites to progress through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the biggest scare venues in Europe.
Dynamo is still undefeated after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign was launched last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday night, measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale.
This year it was the tenth in Zagreb.
Wenger believes Arsenal have learned the lesson from last season's Champions League surrender against Monaco and remain driven by the far-reaching hope of leading the club to its first European Cup triumph with his management.
"This drive is immense", Wenger said.
It's never worked at Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I've been in business long enough to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that teaches us serious lessons about male friendships
The lack of similar representations in shows is obvious, especially in view of how the need for men to open up has become more desperate than ever, as suicide rates among young men at a 15-year high prove.
In 2013, it was the leading cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common in men than women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) declared 2015 the Year of the Man, with the aim of challenging the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that when the sufferer had a high enough percentage of friends with "healthy moods", their chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a healthy circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risk of mental problems.
But of course, you have to have friends first to make a friendship work.
In an age of social media-driven communication, with its emphasis on style over substance, the immediacy of the response is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, vibrant and successful, even when in reality isolation is dominant.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship, which has a much deeper impact on our mental health.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money really can't buy happiness.
The beauty of Friends was that this focus was turned upside down.
Each character was defined not by his work, but by his personality, which shone through the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments of watching football in comfortable seats, and Ross' longing for Rachel - all came from knowing that men can relate to it anyway, even if they often hold back from fully exploring their feelings.
As one telephone operator explained to me: "My role as a listener for people who are depressed and at risk of suicide has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference".
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to their friends.
The old saying, "I can handle it", has a huge effect, like feeling that it's perceived as weakness when you talk openly about problems".
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term coping mechanisms.
It's a very clear representation of the little moments of male friendship.
As much as my objective outsider status over the phone may help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
So if you're going to the Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend with the completely redesigned backdrop to celebrate the day, why don't you take your friends for a drink at Central Perk?
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting alone at Starbucks, give them a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends is being broadcast on Comedy Central from start to finish - all 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria is celebrating with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his win against Malmö.
Di Maria will make his Champions League debut on Tuesday and help PSG pass Malmö.
Here's the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on course as Paris Saint-Germain began their Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 win over Malmö at the Princes Park Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria made his Champions League debut less than four minutes after starting as a PSG player, which set the French champion on the road, but after that they missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their lead when Cavani scored a goal in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champions, as they are not only seeking qualification for the knockout rounds but an improvement on their way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they were getting the points, it was not a class game of Laurent Blanc's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovic missed opportunities before the goal.
"It's not easy to win the Champions League at home or away, so it's a good start to win 2-0, to cause problems for our opponents and to look back relaxedly, even if there are certain things we still need to perfect over the course of the season", Blanc said.
"This is a good omen.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret not scoring another goal or two".
Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team after his injury in one of three changes, which was able to keep a 2-2 draw on home soil against Bordeaux in the Premier League on the weekend, but he was stabbed in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentine striker was touted as the man who could take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he hinted at why when he entered Marco Verrattis Pass behind Malmö's defence before he passed Johan Wiland nicely into the long corner of the net.
However, if anyone thought PSG would win a big victory, they were disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach this stage, joined Anpiff with nine national players on the field and was a tough opponent with a five-man defense and two down in midfield.
But with the exception of a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who passed far past Kevin Trapp's posts in the 34th minute, they offered little in the attack.
Instead, PSG itself sometimes gave up, with some failures and poor results, not least from Ibrahimovic, who suffered only five tries in the first half and was then dropped after Cavani used him after the reboot.
Nevertheless, he proved much more skillful when he brought his teammates into the game, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic that Di Maria turned into a shot that was passed by Wiland in the 52nd minute at the post...
The second goal was finally scored shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan scored his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic had caught a left flank of Maxwell.
This ended all thoughts that Malmö could return to the game, and only Wiland's excellent interception from short range to stop David Luiz could keep the final score low before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi was denied a goal in the end.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG played a class over his team, and the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then, we've only played in the Swedish league, which doesn't have the same level.
Qualifying games are not enough".
Get your hat off Paris!
It was a great game of theirs!
Glencore is raising $2.5 billion through stock sales
The Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, which is hit by plummeting commodity prices, raised $2.5 billion on Wednesday in a stock sale as part of its massive debt repayment plan.
The London-based Glencore company said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay off its own debt.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices as China's economic downturn squeezes demand and has devastating effects on markets.
The issue of rights of reference brought Glencore's share price to the top of the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday morning.
The stock jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 Index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore announced last week the $2.5 billion stock sale as part of its larger plans to pay off about a third of its $30 billion in debt.
The company sold the new shares at 125 pence per share, which was a 2.4% discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns over long-term growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half, while coal, copper and other commodity prices have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arriving in Weimar
On Tuesday afternoon, 49 people arrived at the Weimar city hall after a long escape.
The refugees are from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The newest arrival is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday.
Xi's first official visit to Washington will take place on September 25 and will return President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, the statement said.
The US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner this evening after the two leaders held bilateral talks.
"President Xi's visit will provide an opportunity to expand US-China cooperation on a range of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while also providing President Obama and President Xi with an opportunity to constructively address areas of disagreement", the statement added.
The XI, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to meet several US technology leaders on its way to Washington in Seattle before moving on to New York City for the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of controversial issues, including Washington's concerns about alleged Chinese cyber espionage and its growing self-confidence in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
440 hp sports cars borrowed and scrapped
A 29-year-old wanted to fulfill a dream and borrowed a Ford Mustang.
Then, on the rainy highway, the evil awakening came.
At a company in Gotha County, you can fulfill your dream and once borrow and drive a 440 hp Ford Mustang Boss 302 V8 sports car.
A 29-year-old from Gotha County did the same.
On the A71 near Arnstadt, the dream was over.
The 29-year-old lost control of the sports car, slipped onto a wet track and drove to the control panel.
The sports car was totally damaged, no one was hurt.
The damage is estimated at EUR 40 000.
Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented a move to FC Bayern in 2008
World and European champion Xavi has been playing for al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
FC Bayern was obviously close to being contracted by Spanish superstar Xavi, who was playing for FC Barcelona at the time, a few years ago.
Eight times Spanish champion, three times Cup winner, four times Champions League winner, two times club world champion, two times European champion, once world champion - Xavi's title list is breathtaking.
In the summer, the now 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar.
However, in an interview with Marca, Xavi now reveals that he was already before the 2008 European Championship before leaving Barcelona.
"I was told Barça wanted to sell me".
"Madrid won everything, we won nothing", he says.
And that was registered by FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bayern".
"Rummigge wanted me".
In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi didn't change.
But the change did not come about.
And the man behind it is working for the German record-holder, Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barca signed Guardiola and I played a great European Championship".
"Pep told me I wouldn't change, that he couldn't imagine the team without me".
"That's how he got me".
Who knows how Bayern's 2008/2009 season would have gone with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter-finals of the Champions League against Bayern over the entire distance on the turf, switching the Reds off (4:0, 1:1) and celebrating the King's Class triumph at the end.
Matt Damon is downplaying diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she wasn't needed behind the scenes.
During an episode of HBO's Project Greenlight's Sunday Night, the veteran actor interrupted Brown when he stressed the need for alternative perspectives, referring to a black protagonist in the project's chosen script.
"When we talk about diversity, it's when you're casting the movie, not when you're casting the show", Damon assured.
Brown reacted shocked, with insulted disbelief, and shouted, "Hoo! Wow. Okay", as the actor's comments from The Martian consolidated.
Damon and Brown joined production teammates Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the finalists.
"I want to encourage people to think about - whoever the director is - how they treat the Harmony character", Brown said at first.
The only black person, and she's a whore beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People defended the film's directing rights for finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon replied that their directing "could ultimately give us something we don't want".
After the discussion went live, social media exploded with disapproval over Damon's comments.
Twitter user Mr. Pooni expressed his anger over the clip by writing, "Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain their diversity - that's SO KNOWING it hurts".
The tweet has earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its release.
Damon's comments come at a time when accurate representation of racial identity in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained national attention and urged lawmakers and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, singer Prince made a nod to the movement during the Grammy Awards' nomination for Album of the Year.
"Albums still matter", he said.
Like books and black life, albums still have their meaning.
Recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement released a statement in response to Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck's question whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"Black Lives Matter is a love group", the leaders said.
Recently, it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls who are being invited to visit the Pope to discuss the portrayal of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowned first champion
Professional athlete and climber Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night, taking home the $1 million grand prize.
The competition show, which just completed its seventh season, had never seen a contestant complete all stages of its obstacle course.
During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the final.
The last task was to climb a 75-foot-long climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten completed the task within the time, becoming the first athlete to complete the strenuous phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero completed the challenge three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke to E!NEWS after the hard-fought victory, still shocked by the $1 million Grand Prix.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about it, I've never earned more than $10,000 or had a life", Isaac E! said of his heap of money.
So suddenly... I can't even imagine what it's like... the future is unknown.
Executive producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Britten, although he was the first to finish the course, did not receive any prize money.
The money goes to the fastest person.
"If there's more than one finalist, the one with the fastest time gets it", Weed said.
How much money is a wonderful price and life-changing, he gets the great gratification.
I don't think he has any grudge against it.
He's just so happy to have done what he did.
He received a lot of awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a great family man.
He's a hero to his children and his wife.
Geoff told me, "If I get beaten by someone, I'm glad it's Isaac".
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they had switched roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been renewed for an eighth season, which will begin filming in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneaking past the Minnesota Twins
The second half of the season wasn't particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
They used to be one of the best teams in baseball, but now the Tigers are in last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are down to their role as a spoiler, but they played this part perfectly against the Minnesota Twins on Tuesday, 5-4 at Target Field.
The Twins wasted a chance to advance within half a game of the Houston Astros to second place in the American League Wildcard.
For Detroit, even if only for one night, it was a return of the three-letter F word that was so hard to grasp for much of the second half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter what", said Tigers manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support as Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth, and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) hit six times in 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
"I want to finish this year strong", Simon said.
It's hard to throw every game in the bullpen, and that's why I want to get into the game with all my focus.
The designated Tiger-Hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He's got the slaughterhouse well bent", said Ausmus.
He looked good in the strike training, looked much better in the bullpen, and he brought it right into the game.
With three runs in the back of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance of getting back in the game.
Center fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left field line.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks hit a home run, and Simon struck out his second baseman Brian Dozier before being replaced by left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy outlasted Muir, the only man he faced, before designated rookie batter Miguel Sano, who pulled right-handed Drew Verhagen out of a two-run.
With a pair of runners and the final run in the second, Verhagen brought third baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the 27th time this season that Plouffe hit a double play.
After Detroit added an insurance run in the bottom of the ninth inning, Wall scored an RBI double against Tigers closer Bruce Rondon and led the team to a 5-4 record.
The right-hander, however, knocked Sano out on three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit took advantage of a Phil Hughes who hadn't moved yet.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran who had been removed from the injured list before the game after missing more than a month due to back pain.
"Obviously not the start I wished for", Hughes said, "but I felt better when I started and felt that I would make some pretty good pitches there in the third inning".
After receiving the lead off batter in the first, the Hushes released a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, who scored a single "up the middle" on the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez made his 0-21 win series with the runners in the scoring position.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, scoring another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to third, ending the threat.
The Tigers added in the second, scoring a one-out double by catcher James McCann and a two-out single by center fielder Anthony Gose to 3-0.
"That was a big hit", said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he got the right spot.
Hughes was in a pitch count, scoring no points in the third inning before being replaced by right-handed relief pitcher A.J. Achter.
Hughes had three runs on six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTE: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez has been dismissed for a shoulder injury.
He's being investigated by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who's been on the injured list since mid-August for a shoulder sprain, is scheduled to be activated for Wednesday's start.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is removed from the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris is 1-1 in four starts with the Tigers since being acquired in exchange for LHP David Price on July 30.
He's been missing since August 20th, due to a torn right hip joint.
The Tigers and the Twins will finish their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2,4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota's RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees are to be accommodated in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hesse.
His arrival was expected on Wednesday night.
The people who arrived in it will then be placed in emergency shelters in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday evening.
She expected 450 to 750 refugees to arrive.
Several sports halls in the Hessian capital had been prepared for this case in recent days.
Up to 1,000 refugees can stay there temporarily.
They will then be distributed to other municipalities.
In the last ten days alone, 7500 people have arrived in Hessen, according to the government office responsible for the first intake.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency shelters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military action in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military action involving Germany in Syria an option.
"I believe that decisive thinking about military action options cannot take place without Germany", he said.
He accused the European countries of "collective disregard".
Four years ago, you would have been happy that the chalice had passed a military involvement in Germany.
"Now the conflict is crashing down on our doorstep", he told German radio.
The former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for the refugees.
Austria controlled at its southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has also re-established controls at its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner told the Austrian television station ORF on Tuesday evening that no one is being sent back to Hungary.
Germany has not sent any refugees back to Austria.
"No, that's what we agreed", she explained.
Asked about an agreement whereby Germany could take in a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said there had already been talks between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
She did not give any specific figures and referred to Wednesday's talks in Berlin.
In the past few days, tens of thousands of refugees had arrived in Austria from Hungary via the so-called Balkan route.
Their target is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann have called for a special summit next week, together with several other EU Heads of State and Government.
Germany had started temporary border checks on Sunday.
The EU states have so far not been able to agree on a common approach to the crisis.
The EU's interior ministers are planning to launch a new round of action on the mandatory distribution of another 120,000 refugees at a special meeting on Tuesday 22 September.
In view of the large number of refugees in Germany, the Federal Republic of Germany wants to give more support to the countries in the initial reception and distribution of people.
The Federal Government will manage this together with the countries, Merkel announced late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of consultations with the prime ministers at the Chancellery in Berlin.
The Commission has also been asked to take a decision on the implementation of the programme.
But those who do not have a residence prospect cannot stay in Germany.
This view was strongly shared in the round.
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now handle a "huge force effort".
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stranded on the Balkan route.
Hungary closed its 175 kilometres long border with Serbia on Tuesday night.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that it would also blockade the border with Romania with a fence.
This neighbouring country is not part of the EU, unlike Serbia.
Hungary wants to prevent smugglers from looking for ways to escape through Romania, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said of the planned new border fence.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut through the fence.
In Turkey, meanwhile, thousands more migrants were on their way to the Greek border, according to eyewitness reports.
Cassini is finding the ocean on Saturn's moon Enceladus
Under the ice sheet of the Saturn moon Enceladus, a global ocean is sweeping.
This is what researchers have concluded from observations of the Cassini spacecraft.
Thus, the moon is moving slightly in its orbit around the ring planet.
This thunderstorm is small but too large for a continuously fixed celestial body, says a statement from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, on Tuesday.
The researchers present their analysis in the journal "Icarus".
It was known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice sheet of Enceladus.
Cassini had already discovered ice volcanoes at the south pole of Saturn's moon in 2006, which spew water vapour and ice particles, thus feeding Saturn's so-called E-ring.
At least there must be an underground sea at the South Pole, astronomers said at the time.
The extent of the hidden ocean, however, was not clear.
Rama is missing 1860 Munich several weeks
1860 Munich must forfeit about a month of offensive player Valdet Rama.
An investigation revealed an adductor injury in the 27-year-old, the association said.
Rama had already complained of pain earlier this week.
According to Münchener Löwen, the diagnosis "probably means four weeks of forced rest".
"We are in a difficult situation, Rama is a terrible loss".
"Of course we need to think about it now", sports director Necat Aygün told the "Bild" newspaper, looking at the potential commitment of a disagreeable professional.
The 1960s, however, first introduced a defensive player as a training guest.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was most recently active in Belgium and had previously been signed by VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croatian currently has the opportunity to 'proven his ability'.
Goalkeeper Rubin Okotie can return to team training next week after suffering a concussion.
The Austrian national team is scheduled to start running training on Thursday.
Okotie had been injured in a head-on collision in the match at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3).
Despite initial fears, however, he was left without a serious injury.
No dietary fruit - mangoes contain a lot of sugar
Mangoes are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But those who wish to keep their line of thought are often more likely to be rebuked by them.
Because mangoes contain a relatively high amount of sugar - especially sucrose.
However, the exotic fruits are healthy: they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. But mangos are especially rich in vitamin A and its precursor, beta-carotene.
Eating the fruit helps to support vision, immune system, and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying mangoes, they should not be too soft or too firm and should smell pleasant.
The color of the shell alone does not tell us how ripe the fruit is - so even green mangoes can taste very good.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then they taste pure, or sweet, of course.
But a mango also gives a special touch to hearty dishes.
It soothes the slightly bitter taste of some leafy salads like chicoree and radiccio.
And a mango cutney is good for fish, poultry, lamb and game.
The US-based UPS package service is recruiting up to 95,000 Christmas business aids in the US.
The company has already started recruiting seasonal workers, UPS said on Tuesday.
Drivers are particularly wanted.
As early as last year, UPS had increased its workforce by 95,000 for the holiday season.
In light of the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been making arrangements for the Christmas business since last year.
In 2013, late deliveries brought harsh criticism to parcel services.
First the Föhnstorm, then the distinctive cold front
The next night, the foe will break through the valleys of the Alpine northern side, as Meteoschweiz reported on Tuesday.
On Wednesdays and Thursday nights, the fireman blows through the fires with storm force.
After a Thursday morning's roaring, we cross a distinctive cold front, bringing heavy rainfall, wind shear and a drop in temperature.
As MeteoNews reports in a statement, Switzerland is currently at the forefront of a large low-pressure area over the British Isles in a strong southwest current.
On the northern side of the Alps, the fountain breaks through the valleys on Wednesday night.
The following is the wind blowing in the furnaces from 60 to 100 km/h until Thursday morning, occasionally and especially in the urnlands, sometimes at more than 100 km/h.
The fountain can gradually penetrate into the adjacent central country, and even hurricane winds of over 120 km/h are possible in the mountains.
While stormy foam warms north on Wednesday to summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees, humidity begins to build up on the Alpine slope.
It's raining here, and it's going to last until Thursday night.
In total, some 100 litres of rain per square metre are expected in the next 48 hours south of the Alps, after heavy rainfall in recent days.
On Thursday morning, the wind blows out, and a cold front with heavy, sometimes violent, rain falls from west to east over Switzerland.
Along with the cold front, the wind is strong to stormy, and temperatures are falling sharply.
The following days are 15 to 20 degrees Celsius in the north in autumn, while the southern part is sunnier and warmer at weekends by up to 25 degrees Celsius.
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Almost 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of Mayor Ignazio Marino, a previously unnamed square in the park on Oppio Hill was named after the German reformer on Wednesday.
He is now honored on the "Piazza Martin Lutero" as "the German theologian of the Reformation".
The park is in the middle of ancient Rome right next to the Colosseum.
The name had been requested by the working group of the evangelical churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome, reminded us on Wednesday that Protestants in the city of the popes, for centuries, as a minority, often lived their faith only in secret.
The square symbolically shows that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) spent several months in Rome as a young Augustinian monk around the turn of the year 1510/11.
He felt the city was a corrupt sinful Babylon.
According to historians, his negative impressions may have strengthened him in his later fight against Rome.
Luther then introduced the division of the Western Church with his theses against the slave trade.
Hammer Artist spent three years in personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (gold) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not the Otmar Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent images.
At first, the picture was for Otmar Alt, who in 150 motifs formulated his personal interpretations of Bible stories on paper and canvas.
The 75-year-old has received his "language" of colorful and imaginative shapes - but this is by no means the same as "fun" images.
On the contrary, it can be quite grim if it is adapted to the specific subject.
For about three years Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project, for which he made a subjective artistic selection from the many themes of the "Book of All Books".
Cycles have been created that deal with topics such as the Crusades, plagues, commandments, or the Fatherland.
This has spontaneously fascinated several partners: Luther's publishing house with its theological focus, as well as Kettler's publishing house with its focus on art books.
And there is the author Klaus Altepost, who, based on the painting, examined the Bible verses.
He interpreted the Bible texts selected by Otmar Alt and thus "translated" them into modern-day contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of old paintings.
They are embedded between the original Bible quote by Martin Luther and each one of the artist's sentences, which here formulate his very personal thoughts on the situation.
The jewelry band has golden letters.
So the 75-year-old allows you to double-check his soul, his emotions.
That's a high degree of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately the catalyst for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in 1940 in Wernigerode and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herrnhuter Order.
"There was a time when the education was done with the pipe", recalls Otmar Alt.
"I've tried to work this out, so I might get along with Mr. Father again".
His second concern was to help bring art back to its place in a rapidly changing world: "The perception of visual worlds is now marked by advertising, and it is loud.
Symbolic is being suppressed.
Artists have a different desire and desire to show things.
Pictures always have something mysterious and they're not decorative.
"In that respect, I'm a dinosaur".
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to "fall into" the images, to be influenced by them, to discover and feel their power: "The image is looking for its opposite".
Klaus Altepost, at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt Bible at the Otmar-Alt Foundation on Tuesday, admitted that he had "always" been a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like the way he understands life with his pictures".
Instead of trying to understand the Bible in its entirety, Alt chose the topics that were important to him, even mysterious.
"It was not a collaboration on equal terms", says Altepost. "It was about the pictures, the text only explains".
For Hans Möhler of Luther's publishing house, this work is an invitation to "deep into life and find freedom".
Otmar Alt's paintings speak to Möhler both the (biblical) language of love and that of responsibility.
A part of the original - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition to open on 15 November at the Otmar-Alt Foundation.
Construction of BMX railway is about to begin
Plans were made, places were found, companies were hired, hills were designed for a round trip: a year later, almost everything was ready - but before the official opening of the BMX train, it was finished.
Failures in politics and administration caused frustration, especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway.
So hills moved, new places sought - now with formal planning and a building permit application.
The approval will be given in October, Sabine Mosebach-Bock, First Municipal Councillor, was able to inform the Committee on Children and Youth.
"I hope that this year there will be more visible", she said.
The work on the former hall bath should then be started without "another memorial pause".
DFB intensifies its commitment to refugees
The DFB extends its commitment to refugees until 2019, the Bundesliga sets a clear sign this weekend.
The football industry is responding to the deteriorating situation in Germany and is assuring the political community of its assistance in tackling the problems ahead.
"I consider this to be the greatest challenge facing our country since reunification".
"Nobody can say, basically, that's none of my business, I have nothing to do with it".
"It must be of interest to everyone to get this issue under control", said DFB head Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
"I'll be in the chancellery next Wednesday and meet with the Minister of State, Mrs. Özoğuz, and the Chancellor".
"The subject will certainly play a central role", he announced.
Football can and will help.
But the decisive routes must be set by the policy.
The German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative '1:0 for a welcome' by four years.
"We have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019 through the Egidius-Braun Foundation", Niersbach said at the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's/Malta.
Some federal leagues also support this programme.
Already this weekend, the 36 professional clubs will be making a clear mark when they will wear the "We help - #refugeeswelcome" sign on the left shirt shirt instead of the usual sponsorship logo (Hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and howver they can", said Rudi Völler, Leverkusen's sports director, to the Bild newspaper (Tuesday), calling the project "self-evident".
"The refugee drama is for everyone, no one can look away".
"We, the football league, can, no, we need to use our radiance, our influence and our capabilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly", Hertha manager Michael Preetz said.
Peter Rettig, the managing director of Hoffenheim, spoke of a "prominent sign of the league".
For the European qualifying match against Hungary on Friday, the women's national team is inviting 100 refugees to Halle/Saale.
Niersbach described the support of refugees as "a great community effort of German football".
It's great that all 36 licensing societies have started their own projects in their respective places.
It's just as great that small and small clubs are active there.
The message of "1:0 for a welcome" we've been issuing is alive in football.
"This is of great importance", he said.
In this year and the following, the association, together with the DFB-Selection and the German government, will each provide €300,000 for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already recalled the entire sum for 2015", Niersbach reported.
Reports: SAP CEO loses an eye in an accident
Bill McDermott, the CEO of Europe's largest software company, reportedly lost his left eye in a crash in early July.
In the staircase accident at his brother's house in the United States, he fell after midnight on a glass of water he was holding in his left hand, reports "Economic Week" on Wednesday.
"He was almost bloodied, passed out, then dragged out onto the street - he told us that last week", said Hasso Plattner, SAP co-founder at WiWo.
But McDermott can do his job.
"In early October, we will meet before the Walldorf Supervisory Board meeting", Plattner said.
The 54-year-old manager was present at the meeting and "fully capable of working".
McDermott announced in an interview with the Süddeutsche Zeitung (Thursday's issue) that he will return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group.
"I'm full of SAP, full of my job".
"Of course, I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman, Hasso Plattner, the whole time", McDermott told the "SZ".
McDermott usually commutes between Germany and the US, but since the summer he has been away from SAP's German headquarters in Walldorf.
He said it was important to him to go public with such a personal story, the manager of the "SZ" said: "Anyone can get away with something like this".
"It's important to get up when you fall".
McLaren replacement pilot Magnussen is out of combat .
Magnussen tweeted a corresponding photo and stated that he suffered the injury when he fell off the bike.
He is therefore not as much in demand as the reserve driver for the two regular pilots Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button at the Singapore night race on the weekend as he was a week later at the Japanese Grand Prix.
Football: BVB without reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in the goal
Borussia Dortmund have finally broken all hopes of a comeback by Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europa League.
The national player will also be missing the leader of the Bundesliga table in the duel with Krasnodar on Thursday (19:00 Sky).
"We cannot, unfortunately, call on him", Thomas Tuchel said on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back in the Bundesliga top-flight against Leverkusen on Sunday, the BVB coach said: "We expect him to return to training on Friday".
Given the high pressure of his professionals, Tuchel will not only change his stems at the reus position.
So he announced a change in goalkeeper position.
That's why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of Stammkeeper Roman Bürki.
"He's training at an absolute top level", the football coach praised the world champion.
However, Tuchel did not say whether Weidenfeller would be used in all Europa League games in the future.
He'll probably be able to fight the second game, too.
The research statement by fellow player Reus that the final draw for BVB in the Europa League must be the goal, midfielder Julian Weigl considers understandable: "Marco is not so wrong about that".
"I think we have a good chance of getting the title".
Robots: Government wants to be a pioneer for Germany
Germany is to be a technological pioneer in the transformation of the car, according to the will of the German government.
The Federal Cabinet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) on Wednesday, which provides for, inter alia, investment in the development of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt am Main on the sidelines of the IAA auto show of a "new era of mobility".
Automated and connected driving will increase road safety and reduce traffic congestion, Dobrindt said.
He also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G7 countries, who also meet with industry representatives at the IAA.
The strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport stresses, inter alia, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid transition to digital radio.
A test track is currently being built on the 9th motorway in Bavaria to test new technology.
In order to ensure that the driver "has no additional liability risks", the German government wants to "review the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments".
For example, Germany wants to make international efforts to increase the maximum speed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 km/h.
The German government also wants to promote an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for people as drivers.
With automated driving, the car is increasingly taking over the lead, and the driver is increasingly becoming a passenger.
The technology is primarily based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economy, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, driverless vehicles on public roads are "not to be expected until well after 2020".
The value added in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the site in Germany is estimated by the authors of the study to be around EUR 8.4 billion by 2025.
"Digital connectivity of the road can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road transport", said SPD transport politician Sören Bartol.
The question of liability in the event of accidents and the security of the drivers' personal data must be clearly clarified.
Still, the Germans are skeptical of self-driving cars - far more so than French or Americans.
A survey conducted by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the Decra research organization on Wednesday at the AA found that only eight percent of Germans believe that self-driving cars will prevail in the next ten years, 32 percent expect it in 20 years, 31 percent don't believe it at all.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect self-driving cars by 2025, while in the United States, 33 percent.
In Germany, however, motorists are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self-driving vehicle.
According to a survey by the Digital Association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to hand over control throughout the entire journey on all roads.
On the highway, this could be 15 percent in traffic flow, 45 percent in traffic congestion.
Well, one in four would never leave the car in control.
Boll canceled team and double start at Table Tennis EM
The Düsseldorf side will be looking to win the title from 25 September to 4 October.
The final decision shall be taken no later than 22 September.
"This is a huge loss for our team".
"The boys found out this morning".
"We are strong enough to win the title without Timo", said German coach Jörg Roßkopf during the European Championship in Düsseldorf.
Boll was on a long-term sponsorship appointment in China at the time.
The 34-year-old German champion is expected back on Friday.
"Without Timo, the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favourite", said European singles champion Dmitry Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who leads the set list in Yekaterinburg, also recalled the 2013 European Championship in Schwechat.
"Timo was also missing, and we became European champions".
"That's what we should be focusing on", the fifth-ranked world ranking explained.
English national football player Luke Shaw of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury to his right leg.
In the Champions League game against PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit by a tackle by Héctor Moreno and replaced after a long treatment.
The first diagnosis was a 20-year-old Bastian Schweinsteiger's partner who suffered a fractured hip.
Gaultier feels too old for a child terrible
It is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a wax figure-grusella cabinet: the designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition of his work in Munich on Wednesday.
The highlights: Puppet showers that look terribly human through video projections.
They're the spectacular creations of the French designer who, among other things, became a fashion star with Madonna's stage outfits and putting men in skirts.
"I can't say today that I'm the child terrible of haute couture because I have white hair".
"It used to be bleached, now it's real", said Gaultier.
For visitors to the exhibition "From the Sidewalk to the Catwalk", which will be on view at the Kunsthalle of the Hypo-Culture Foundation from 18 September, it is fortunate that the designer has changed his initially negative attitude towards a view of his person.
He actually said he was against it, because, "To me, an exhibition sounded a little deathlike", he said.
When you die, you go to the museum.
The impressive collection had been made in Montreal and Paris Station in Canada.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful dresses", said the director of the art hall, Roger Diederen.
It's about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give a glimpse into the hardly-seen work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed any training.
The show is not chronologically structured, but it is an excellent choreographed work of art for which a great deal of effort has been put into it.
According to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, the makers have transported 14 tons of material to Munich.
Just before the start of the Oktoberfest, there was another special treat: a leather trouser outfit with corset.
Heidi is meeting Madonna.
He was always interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and people who are a little different, Gaultier said.
Gaultier's old Teddy is also on display.
It represents the designer's first, shallow fashion attempts.
As a child (he wasn't a good student and bad at football) he wore his Teddy BHs and dresses, Gaultier said.
His parents wouldn't have let him play with a doll.
He later taught himself fashion design.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at other designers' designs, as Gaultier told us in Munich.
But then I bought them, of course.
He couldn't afford the models for his first fashion show.
They got nothing, but they were allowed to keep their clothes.
Jewelry instead of curtains - Plauener top as a fashion niche
In the past, the long-distance stitchers were all about making meters.
The embroidered fabrics and tips were produced in large quantities for customers who processed them into, for example, blankets and curtains.
This alone no longer works today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, managing director of fashion spots Pluen.
Instead, fashion is back to being important.
In the early days of the Plauen peak, fashion played a larger role, was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now being rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt gives some examples: high-end jewelry, accessories such as bags, and regional wear.
In general, the so-called vintage fashion, which is based on past styling patterns, represents an increasing order potential.
If you are not in the textile industry in Germany, you are no longer in the market.
They're already half the orders we've got.
Along with nine other companies, Plauener Spitze and Stickers is a member of the industry association.
Only they can wear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, about 80 percent of sales have been lost.
Private specialist shops and wholesale shops are almost non-existent.
Our products hardly reach customers this way.
The mass goods are now produced much cheaper in Asia and are sold almost exclusively through chains.
In addition, exports to Russia and the United States are currently declining.
So there are plenty of reasons for new ways.
The association also tries to score points through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer of the Falkenstein Stickperle explains: "Since this year we have been running a quality seal that shows that we are producing environmentally and socially sustainable".
Reinhardt adds: "This also applies to the materials used".
Ute Schmidt, a graduate designer, teaches at the Schneeberger External Office of the West Saxon University of Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroidery and knitting.
To counter the competition from Asia, you have to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a tension between the freshest ideas of designers and businesses that need to think economically", says Schmidt.
That is why existing designs are often slightly modified to retain a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball peak.
The machine puts small balls in some places.
Plauen goldsmith Bianca Hallebach-Krauße was inspired by this: "I could not do anything with traditional Plauen tip".
Now she's using the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In a sophisticated process, she forms the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify with the theme of Plauener Spitze - young and old", says Reuter.
It also supplies to the USA, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in and around Plauen and who want a souvenir.
So I can see my jewelry as a modern ambassador for the Plauen elite.
Disney is planning a new Mary Poppins movie.
I don't want to touch legends, but Disney is still daring to make a new film of his classic "Mary Poppins".
However, according to Entertainment Weekly, this is not a remake, but a sequel set 20 years after the first film with the magical toddler.
It's about Nanny's experiences with the Banks family during the Great Depression in England.
Who's playing Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is already in the picture, Rob Marshall, with his latest movie, "Into the Woods".
Xi urges to open up the economy to the world
The economy needs to open up more broadly to the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with steering reform on Tuesday.
"China should strive to attract foreign investment and know-how and improve business start-up strategies", he said in a speech at the 16th Central Leadership Group meeting on deepening a comprehensive reform.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of unfair competition in the labour market, which is the subject of a review of the Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from unfair competition in the labour market, was adopted by the Council on 1 January 2005.
The Steering Group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list on regulating market access, relaxing border control policies, promoting state-owned enterprises (SOEs), incorporating private capital, and overhauling the resident reporting system.
The statement shall be followed by a negative list identifying sectors and companies which are not eligible for investment.
The system is being tested and improved gradually through test programmes.
The initiative is important because it gives the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensures a rule of law business environment and makes the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also relax controls on the powers vested in companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
The Commission has also proposed to open up a number of private investment areas to the public sector.
"The Government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services to them", the statement said.
In addition, it will make it easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or green card by optimising requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right to guarantee the legal profession and to employ professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting was attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and key leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in a statement released after the meeting.
EU aims to double the limit value of mercury in predatory fish
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predatory fish and thus give consumers a significantly higher dose of nerve poisoning.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which has an EU working paper on the matter, has strongly criticised the plans: "The risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are being strongly passed on to pregnant women and young children", Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch explained.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limits on nerve toxicity for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as sharks or swordfish, are to be raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish for 'economic reasons'.
However, large predatory fish are already so heavily burdened with mercury that, according to the limits still in force, about 50 percent of their catch is not allowed to be sold.
After doubling the limits, only 14.5% would remain unsold.
In return for this easing, the EU intends to increase the limit values for other fish from 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram, according to Foodwatch.
Foodwatch called this a "trick" because smaller fish, such as carp, are usually so low in load that they already meet the planned maximum levels today.
The reduction in small fish stocks is therefore "a perfidious diversion which alone helps the economy", Wolfschmidt explained.
Mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal to humans, which is rich in the food chain, especially in predatory fish.
The German government warns that "even small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system, especially in the case of unborn babies".
The Federal Ministry for the Environment, however, states on its website that, in view of the applicable maximum levels, a 'public health risk' is not to be expected.
Mercury is mainly absorbed by the burning of coal.
According to a written report by the German Environment Ministry to the Green Party MEP Annalena Baerbock, German coal plants produce more than six tonnes of mercury per year, two thirds of the total quantity emitted in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example in the Elbe, Rhine and Danube, was "permanently and extensively exceeded", the "mirror" had quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, warnings from across Europe about mercury in fish were already among the most common health risks reported in the EU's RASFF warning system.
