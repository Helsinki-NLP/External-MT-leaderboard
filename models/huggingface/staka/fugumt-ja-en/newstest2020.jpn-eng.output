Driving on high heels is dangerous!
Frequent Accidents in Young People's Pedals (Auto Messe Web ) - Yahoo! News
a violation of the Road Traffic Act)
It’s a big mistake to think that it’s a problem only for elderly drivers, as reports of accidents caused by erroneous operations such as pedaling have increased.
According to the National Police Agency’s 2015 report, there were 1080 cases under the age of 24, more than 1032 cases between the ages of 75 and older.
It’s important to call attention to young people as well, as there’s never a lot of missteps in the elderly.
do you want to take the fashion at your feet?
do you want to be safe?
There is no description of gender ratio or cause in this data, but unlike elderly people who are thought to be often due to physical decline such as driving skills and reflex nerves, it is possible for young people to mistakenly take care of other things such as music and conversation, or to make a mistake due to clothes, etc.
In particular, some women choose various shoes depending on their high heels, pumps, sandals, and mules, and drive them as they are.
Some people know that it is not suitable for driving, but it is troublesome to change clothes, but there are many people who do not think about the possibility that it will lead to danger at all, and are driving without maliciousness.
However, driving in high heels and sandals violates the Road Traffic Act.
One is to "surely operate the steering wheel, brakes and other operations", and Article 70 "violation of safety driving obligations", which stipulates that "don't drive in such a way as to cause accidents and cause harm to people".
The second is Article 71 'Compliance with the Public Safety Committee', which stipulates that the driver must comply with the matters specified by each prefectural public safety committee, and Article 12 of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Act, for example, says, 'Do not drive a vehicle (except a light vehicle) by wearing footwear, slippers, tucks, high heels or other footwear that may interfere with driving operations.'
It is the same for each prefecture to consider driving with "footwear that may interfere with driving operation" as a violation even if it does not specify high heel.
So why is driving on high heels dangerous?
That’s obvious, given the basics of safely manipulating pedals.
In order to operate the pedal safely and reliably, the heel of the foot is first fixed to the floor, the foot is placed so as to be perpendicular to the brake pedal, and when stepping the accelerator pedal, the foot is tilted to the right with the support point there.
At this time, regardless of the behavior of the car, it is important to keep it firmly fixed so that the heel does not blur.
However, in high heels, the area where the heel is grounded on the floor is small, and it is always blurred, and because the height of the heel has an angle on the entire foot, the area of the toe that is grounded on the pedal is also small, and it is difficult to step in firmly, and it makes it difficult to make fine adjustments.
This is thought to lead to danger.
In addition, although most cars have floor carpets, this material is prone to high heel heels, and when the heel is caught and the pedal can not be stepped in, or the high heel can be removed from the beat that the heel is caught, and it is impossible to step in the back of the pedal.
In addition, in some cases, the heel pulls to the back of the pedal and the accelerator pedal does not return when the pedal is treaded back.

U.S. to Accept Refugees for at least 3rd Year in a row | Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan
Washington: The U.S. Department of State said Tuesday it will reduce the maximum number of refugees accepted from around the world to 18,000 in fiscal 2020 (October 19-September 20, 2020).
The minimum number since 1980, when the Refugee Act was enacted, will be renewed for the third consecutive year.
The Trump administration is aiming to appeal strict immigration and refugee policies to conservatives in anticipation of next year’s presidential election.
It is inevitable for human rights groups and others to criticize the people who are being chased by the country in various places.
The former Obama administration set the upper limit for FY17 to 110,000, but the Trump administration, which launched in January 2015, overturned this and reduced it to 50,000.
The number has been decreasing from 45,000 in fiscal year 18 to 30,000 in fiscal year 19.

Local Industry of Awaji Island, Hyogo Prefecture, Kinki Ceramics Applying for Quasi-Self Bankruptcy Debt (Emperor's Data Bank) - Yahoo! News
Consumers' Detachment from tile roofs was also affected by the slump in housing market conditions and the frequent damage caused by the disaster.
Kinki Ceramics Co. , Ltd. (TDB code: 530173983, capital of 99.2 million yen, Otani 881-8, Awaji City, Hyogo Prefecture, Representative Kozo Fukuhara, 44 employees) filed for a quasi-self bankruptcy in Kobe District Court on August 30.
The representative of the application was a lawyer of Yoshida Oji (Nishitenman, Kita Ward, Osaka City, Osaka Prefecture, 1-10-8, Yoshida Oji Law Office, telephone 06-6365-6038) and one other person.
Our company was founded in June 1895 and reorganized as a tile manufacturer in April 1961.
At first, he started his business as a manufacturer of Ibushi tiles, a local industry of Awaji Island, in Nishi-Awamachi, Mihara County (present-day Minami-Awaji City) under the trade name of Kinki Kogyo Co. , Ltd.
In October, 86, the business of Kinki Sangyo Co., Ltd. was merged to absorb Kyowa Kogyo Co., Ltd., and at the same time, the head office was relocated to its current location after changing its current trade name.
After that, it established sales bases in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima City, Oita City, Miyazaki City, etc., and became the current system, and Juzen Ibushi tiles were mainly used, but due to changes in consumer needs, Western tiles such as flat tiles were manufactured at a rate of 70%, and Japanese tiles such as Ibushi tiles were manufactured at a rate of 30%.
He built a wide range of sales bases mainly in western Japan, including major house manufacturers, construction materials trading companies, and roof construction companies, and in the fiscal year ended December 2004, he recorded about 1.16 billion yen in annual sales.
As a tile manufacturer at the top of Awaji Island, he was well-known.
However, the demand for tile roofs increased due to the sluggish housing market after the Lehman Shock, the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto Earthquake, and the annual sales of the December 2018 fiscal year fell to about 1.35 billion yen.
In terms of revenue, in addition to declining profit margins as fuel prices soared, the company was forced to make stringent investments due to excessive beneficiary debt due to inventory burdens and capital investment.
For this reason, although he tried to rebuild his business by requesting financial institutions to relax the conditions for repayment of borrowings, there was no sign of recovery in the business situation, and funds were gradually scrambled.
When he came here, he could not support it and gave up his business continuity, and this was the measure.
Debt is currently under investigation, but is expected to be 2 billion yen.

Dalvish: This Quarter is Awkward in Your Life (East Spo Web) - Yahoo!
[From St. Louis, Missouri, on Monday, March 28]
We haven’t done anything for a couple of days, but watching baseball (from the bench) without any purpose,” a 33-year-old Cubs pitcher told reporters after the playoffs disappeared.
This season, he started 31 games, 6 wins, 8 losses, and a defense rate of 3/98, but he threw 2/3 of 178 times and sacked 299.
Especially in the second half of the game, the pitching form was stable, and the opponents continued to revolt with outstanding ballpower and overwhelming strength.
"I'm sure it's a mistake in my life now, and I didn't think I would feel that way at the age of 33. In spring, I thought, 'I wonder if I'm going to end this way, too,' but I came back from there and felt that I couldn't believe it myself that I could go to a better place."
From about the beginning of June, I gradually got my hands on it.
More and more people can do it every day, and more and more people can do it once a day.
Although there were trial and error, by challenging his own hypothesis one after another, his condition was significantly improved, and his grades improved as a result.
He was thrown out of the injured list throughout the year," he said.
Dalvish, who has the right to opt-out of the deal at the end of this season, says, “I have to think about it. I’m going to talk to agents and my family.” But he says, “Basically, I don’t have any complaints about this team and it’s fun.”
There is no final conclusion, but the feeling seems to be solid.

In a year after the earthquake, seven condominiums installed a "water-spread plug" that allowed water to be discharged even after the power outage, according to the city's corporate office's water supply and sewage department.
There are about 400 condominiums and private-sector apartments in the city that supply water with a "water tank system" that may break water at the time of power outages, and the department is calling for consideration of countermeasures.
The water supply system of the house is roughly divided into two types: 'aquarium receiving type' where water is placed in a irrigation tank located underground or on a rooftop, and 'directly connected type' where water is supplied directly from the city water distribution pipe to each door.
In the tank receiving type, even if the water pipe is not damaged, if the electric pump pump pumping up water from the tank receiving tank to each door stops to move due to power outages, the water supply becomes impossible, and each door breaks water.

Ito also said, "There was a drinking party called a post-mortem, which was just a drinking party that didn't reflect on anything at all," and said, "It was good for the field that I could make such a time. Teamwork was getting better and motivation went up. I continued regularly even after the end, and I had a lot of good memories."

Is "beauty and evil" a single piece of paper?
What is the image of "snake" that overlaps with the beautiful girls of the work (magmics ) - Yahoo!
What do you have in common is a mysterious beauty and a shadowy expression?
Since the 1950s, a number of works have been released to the public, and in August 2019, Genko released “Katsuzu Kazuo Beautiful Girls Collection”, which focuses on the beautiful girls depicted by Dr. Kazura Kazu, who is known as the leading figure of “Fear Manga”.
If you take it in your hand and look at it, you will notice the correlation between "beauty" and "fear" of the work again.
Image ] Is it attractive because there is "shadow"?
■Beautiful Girls of Aoi-zu Kazuo's Works (5 pieces)
In the preface of "Beautiful Girls Collection," there was a sentence that "the shocking scenes and developments of the story stand out because of their beauty in the opposite direction", but the contrast between the beautiful face turns into a distorted and jealous expression of jealousy .
There is a keyword "snake" that appears in many of the works, but snakes are perceived as "uncanny creatures" by people who see it, and there are people who feel "beautiful", and there are various ways to receive it.
Some people like reptiles in the world, while others do not like reptiles.
In this way, depending on the sensibility of the viewer, "beauty" and "evil" may be the creature of the front and back is "snake".
In addition, this creature has been worshipped as a creature with a higher spiritual power than in ancient times, and it is said that the house where "white snake" lived is a good luck.
Among the illustrations on the theme of “snake” are the 1965 “Mamaga Kowai !” series “Hebi-Girl” and “Shura-no-Girl”.
It is generally the market price that becomes a "hived woman" is a beautiful woman with a shadow.
I wonder if it can be said that it is a "cool beauty" type ... ... I think that it is like the commonality of the beautiful girls appearing in the illustration work.
Among them, "Orochi" which is the main character of "Orochi" which was serialized in "Weekly Boy Sunday" from 1969 is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be the representative of the drawing work, but in order to keep eternal life and eternal youth, the deep sleep every 100 years and the part with mysterious power reminds me of somewhere "snake".

Vice-Minister Yamamoto Deletes Meal Tweets Before Explaining Causes of Helicopter Crash | Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan
Mr. Hirohiro Yamamoto, Deputy Minister of Defense, posted a comment with a photo of Mr. Kazuchika Iwata, Secretary of Defense, and deleted the Twitter screen.
Mr. Tatsuhiro Yamamoto, Deputy Minister of Defense, deleted a comment on Twitter that said, "It's delicious!" when eating at a yakitori restaurant in Saga Prefecture by Wednesday.
Mr Yamamoto was in the prefecture on Monday to explain to local governments the investigation results of the crash of an AH64D combat helicopter by the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force in February last year.
On the same night, he tweeted, "I came to Saga Prefecture on a business trip!"
Along with a photo of Kazuchika Iwata, who was elected to the prefectural government for defense, who sat with him for dinner, he posted comments such as "delicious ~".
In the accident, a girl in the house was injured, and two members of the team were killed.
The Yamamoto clan was elected to the House of Representatives four times, and was elected to the Southern Kanto region proportionally.
Koshiyama Wakamizu: There is a circle of “children’s cafeteria” that offers food for children at no cost or at no cost.
According to surveys conducted by NPOs and other organizations, there are about 3,700 activities throughout the country this year.
The number of people living in Fukui Prefecture has increased by 1 to 6 times since 2018, and there are 24 in Fukui Prefecture, up from 9 last year.
i wonder why it's a children's cafeteria right now.
Mr. Makoto Yuasa, chairman of the NPO and social activist, spoke about the background and significance at a lecture held in Sakai City.
With the declining birthrate and the aging population, the area became lonely, and shopping districts also declined.
There was no place for people to meet.
Therefore, there was a demand for an exchange base in a region where people were busy with each other.
Speaking of Yodo Children's Cafeteria, it is a "multigenerational exchange place" where elderly people also participate.
It not only eliminates orchards, but also leads to child-rearing support and health promotion for the elderly.
Cut off the chain of poverty and revitalize the region.
The important thing is, "Don't make a child that's fucked up from there."
There are various places from once a month to serving meals every day.
The venues range in size from a few to hundreds of people, from private homes to temples.
There is an atmosphere that can be done by people who want to do it.
It is attractive to have such a low threshold.
However, it is difficult to secure management costs and staff.
Sometimes we hear about issues such as safe management systems.
Even though it is a trap, Yuasa says that connecting with society will be a safety net in the event of a disaster.
It seems to be a light of hope for a closed society.

FRIDAY: A Drone Attack on Saudi Arabian Petroleum Facility
"In recent years, the Ava Beer, an Iranian drone used in this bombing, has dramatically improved performance by analyzing the drones of the U.S. military that crashed.
It can be manufactured at low cost and has a range of about 1000 km.
The advantage is that it's hard to get caught by radar because it's flying low." (Press cameraman Toru Yokota)
On 14 September, Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, was bombed by 10 military drones.
Immediately after this, Yemen's anti-government organization "Fusi faction" issued a statement of the crime.
"It is no doubt that Iran, under President Rohani's leadership, is behind the Hoosi faction. Iran cannot allow its hostile Saudi Arabia to make money from oil in the context of its own country's inability to export crude oil. It aims to make the international community aware that if Iran continues its embargo on crude oil, it will suffer accordingly," international political analyst Sugawara said.
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia’s oil production was halted and oil prices skyrocketed by 15 percent.
There is also a voice that oil shock will come again at this time.
“Because Trump is committed to withdrawing the U.S. forces from the Middle East, I would like to avoid any military intervention until at least the end of the election next year. After that, Iran will continue to do drone bombardment in secret of the Husi faction. But the U.S. can’t stand it forever. There’s a good chance that Trump will decide to attack Iran in the future,” Sugawara said.
The "surrogate war" between the U. S. and Iran is on the verge of an immediate outbreak.
Why YouTuber, a super-personalist, has become a full-time employee.
Ask the president who adopted it (bizSPA!
9/27 (Fri) 8:47
YouTuber is now extremely popular, especially among young people.
It is not uncommon for a company to use it for advertising of its own products, but some companies have started an unusual system called "YouTuber recruitment" which is employed as a full-time employee in-house.
Direct Marketing Mix Co. , Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as DmMiX) is a company whose main business is CRM (customer relationship management).
What does it mean to "adopt YouTuber"?
I talked to Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, who is the representative director of DmMiX and is also the representative of the subsidiary / staff first that YouTuber was actually adopted this time.
We want to support young people who are hard at work using YouTuber
-- How does "YouTuber adoption" work in the first place?
Kobayashi Kobayashi (Kobayashi ) : The profession of YouTuber is now in love with many young people.
Elementary school students are also at the top of the job ranking that they want to get in the future, and the number of young people aiming for in the future will increase more and more.
Up until now, we have adopted and supported young people who have pursued dreams such as band members and comedians.
Similarly, it is "YouTuber adoption" to recruit and support young people who are chasing the dream of becoming YouTuber.
-- YouTuber has an image that an individual is going to post a video voluntarily.Why did you decide to "adopt" it?
Kobayashi: While many young people fall in love with the job of YouTuber, there is a reality that most YouTuber can’t make as much money as expected.
There are a lot of creators who make and post videos while working part-time, or who are not allowed to recognize the presence of YouTuber by their family.
In this effort, we will provide an environment for the creation of salary and content for the creators who adopted it.
We would like to support our activities by supporting the disadvantages of the profession of YouTuber, which is going to be in an unstable position at first.

South Korea Hopes to Return to GSOMIA - Yahoo! News
South Korea hopes to reconsider and return to South Korea’s decision to abolish the military intelligence comprehensive protection agreement (GSOMIA), which expires on November 23, in a separate interview with the Sankei Shimbun at the U. S. Ambassador’s residence in Tokyo, U. S. Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs Napper said.
It is unusual for a U. S. high-ranking official to mention a reconsideration of the GSOMIA repeal.
GSOMIA will be concluded by Japan, the U. S. , the U. S. , and the U. S. , and will share missile launch information and other information.
South Korea notified it in August that it would break the agreement with Japan, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military information in Japan and South Korea will collapse.
Without GSOMIA, we can’t effectively respond to the crisis,” Napper said.
We have time to retire," he said, urging South Korea to return.
The U. S. and South Korea, which share values such as democracy and human rights, must work together in alliances," he said, noting that it is "the first time in history" for China and Russia to conduct joint flight training in Japan in July.
The recent deterioration in Japan-ROK relations will “damage the national interests of the U. S. ,” he said.
I don't intend to intervene," he said, "but I will play a positive role so that Japan and the ROK can fill the gap. "

Hokkaido News Says 20-Year Nuclear Facility Trouble Caused by Tokai-mura Critical Accident | Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan
A critical accident in Tokai-mura, Ibaraki Prefecture, which was the first of its kind in Japan's nuclear history, occurred between the following year 2000 and fiscal year 18, with 336 reports of accidents and failures at nuclear-related facilities nationwide, according to an interview with the Japan Atomic Energy Agency.
Twenty years after a critical accident that alarmed the safety myths of the nuclear industry.
Although the International Assessment Scale (INES), which shows the degree of severity, accounted for about 90% of cases that are not considered to be safe and important, it is necessary to raise the level of safety awareness based on the lessons learned from the accident and the first Fukushima nuclear accident of Tokyo Electric Power Co. , Ltd. in 2011.
Mitsukazu Muneta, who has completed the story and original picture of a creative picture book and is seeking donations for publication, said on September 18, in Echizen City, Fukui Prefecture.
Koichi Soda, 64, an artist at the Echizen City Regional Revitalization Cooperative Corps in Fukui Prefecture, started a crowdfunding campaign to raise donations online to publish creative picture books inspired by legends in Fukui Prefecture.
Mr. Muneta, a Hokkaido native who started his activities as a collaborator in April of this year, said, "I would like to convey the compassion of the people of Fukui based on their deep faith through picture books. "
[Donations are here] To convey Fukui's heart.
While Soda is active as an artist working on contemporary art based on mathematics, he also works as a collaborator after returning to the calendar.
After working in the towns of Nagano, Kumamoto and Tochigi, he was appointed to Echizen City in April of this year.
It is named after the city that produced Satoko Kako and Hiro Iwasaki, and it aims to create a town by making full use of picture books.
When I lived in the city, Mr. Muneta said, "I was surprised at the depth of compassion around me that I knew for the first time."
One of the highlights is the legend of Awari City, "the face of the bride-in-law ogre".
It is a story that a heart-warming wife continues to chant nenbutsu (Buddhist chant) in order to help Shutome without worrying about being surprised by the fact that the mask of Oni can no longer be taken away from Shutome.
Forget hate and return with mercy and kindness. I felt the origin of the faith and kindness of the people in Fukui.” (Mr. Soda )
Inspired by the original picture book, Muneta went to Yoshizaki Gobo in Awari City as soon as he got to work, and completed the story "Meoto Oni" in which a gentle-hearted Oni couple and a boy appeared.
In June, he made full use of his job to draw 10 scenes with warm watercolor paintings, and the materials of picture books were prepared.
In addition, Echizen Washi, a traditional craftsman living in Echizen City, will be used to make the cover of picture books with Japanese paper.
It leads to the opportunity for parents and children to enjoy the touch of washi (Japanese paper).
For the publication of 600 copies, the goal of the donation is 850,000 yen.
The deadline is until October 25.
Soda said, "Fukui's heart, which has been raised under the historical Buddhist culture, is proud of all of Japan.
I would like to convey the true kindness and compassion passed down to the children through picture books."
It is one of the businesses that Fukui Prefecture recognizes 11 projects of regional revitalization challenged by its collaborators and businesses in Fukui Prefecture and supports them by utilizing their hometown tax payment.
The Fukui Shimbun is providing information and the Fukui Bank is cooperating in business support.
You can donate from the crowdfunding site "Lady Four".

Jurgen Crop, the best director at The Best, looked back on his career in an interview and commented on the status quo.
Among the many comments that surprised the world were Pep Guardiola, the director of Manchester City, his biggest rival to the Premier League title.
namar's best friend, aubes, says, his happiness is still in balsa...
After the award ceremony for The Best, the German commander claimed, "I didn't imagine such a great thing. I'm very happy with it, and I'm proud to have won this award. It was a great few days for me. Thanks to my players, I was able to win. The most important thing is the team."
As for guardiola, Crop said, "I respect him very much" and said, "What can I say about him? He has won many titles. The style in which his team plays is extraordinary. He is the best director I've ever played, and it is one honor to be nominated with him and be able to compete for the prize."
He also mentions the directors Pochetino and Tottenham.
"His last year was incredibly amazing. Most of the time, if you didn't win a title, you wouldn't remember. You had to build a team little by little, and you played in a great style."
Crop didn’t get lost about the best moment of 2019 and commented, “(CL) It’s a reversal in Barcelona. Many experts and myself wouldn’t have bet a centimeter on us. It’s a 3-0 behind against teams with Messi and Suarez. It’s like a death sentence. We’ve had a small opportunity to make it happen. We can’t believe it. If you look back, you might say that we won the CL in this game. This game will be remembered by everyone.”
"When I blessed Bundesliga, I woke up on a bench and I didn't even know where I was. This time I didn't happen. I don't like to be drunk because I'm a man of self-management obsession. I did a very modest blessing for the CL. I remember everything. If I had put everyone in front of me, I might be able to distinguish everyone I saw from the bus."

Special-spec cars were developed based on the idea of "CRAFTED".
CRAFTED embodies the desire to create a new experience that shakes your mind by using all kinds of methods, from craftsmanship to cutting-edge technology, with the sensibility to sense the beauty of Japan cultivated in rich nature and history, and the ambiguity required even without words.
The LC PATINA Elegance is based on the LC500/LC500h and incorporates Lexus’ finest leather L-ANILINE sheet that combines durability while taking advantage of its softness and natural texture, as well as genuine leather steering using soft, hand-touched premium leather.
It is finished as a model that further enhances the texture and taste.
L-ANILINE selects only the highest level of raw skin, and realizes softness with a long process of flexibility and a color coat aiming at thin coating film with unique technology.
Improving the comfort of sitting and the fit during running that envelops the body.
We also use premium leather for steering, so that we can feel the high quality on the skin.
In addition, it is specially equipped with a scuff plate and a color head-up display that metallicizes with alcantara roofs and laser etching and beautifully floats motifs overlapping L-shaped.
The interior is decorated with bright Patina brown specifically for special specifications vehicles, door trim, genuine leather seat, and gorgeous brown combination color arranged on the seat belt.
In addition, the color of the stitch utilizes the two colors of light brown and dark brown with different brightness, and it expresses a high-quality and deep space in combination with a particular texture.
The body color is three colors, including the Terraine khaki meika metallic, sonic titanium, and graphite black glass flakes.
you want to use a sidecar?
According to Apple, the new OS, macOS Catalina, will be available by the end of October.
That specific date is not disclosed, but maybe it will be delivered on October 4th.
macOS Catalina may be released on October 4th?
The image above was posted on Apple’s site in Denmark (now fixed).
The image certainly has the letter "fra den ok oktober" from October 4.
If it is the official website, it seems that the accuracy of the information is also high.
By the way, I personally want to try the most “Sidecar” feature on macOS Catalina.
This is a feature that treats the iPad as a sub-display of a Mac, and it is a feature that has been realized in the past with a third-party app.
And since Sidecar is Apple’s pure feature, it’s expected to be more complete (or responsive) than ever before.
There are rumors of the next MacBook Pro with a 16-inch display, but first of all, I would like to experience this next generation of macOS.
PT Takes 290 Meter of Water in Shizuoka City | Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan
This year's sakura shrimp was successfully photographed in the deep sea of Suruga Bay off the coast of Kashihara, Kiyomizu Ward, Shizuoka City.
The "Yuhi Sakura Ebi Project" of the Marine Industry Cluster Council by industry, academia, and academia, such as Shizuoka City, has recently succeeded in photographing sakura Ebi, which is thought to have been born in the spawning season of spring and summer this year, at the bottom of the sea at 290 meters deep in Suruga Bay.
The video of the growth process is valuable, and the people concerned want to lead to the elucidation of the ecology of many mysterious sakura shrimp.
The film was shot near the seabed, about 1-5 km off the coast of Kashihara, Shimizu-ku, the same city.
Approximately 300 were confirmed in 17 minutes.
In the daytime, it was once again confirmed that the sakura shrimp in the deep sea was forming a certain group in the seabed.
The adult body is about 40 millimeters in length, and the individual seen is about 23 millimeters in length.
It was compared with the seasonal data of the fried salmon shrimp, and the spawning period was identified.
Detailed analysis is requested by Fujitsu Software Technologies, which makes up the team, and Shizuoka Institute of Technology.
Esuke Mizuno, project leader, said, "I want to capture the life of individuals in the growth process, including young shrimp. "

[The first half of the bad olympics race] World champion Kengo Momoda, strong Shutensei is leading one step!
<Men's Singles> (Bad × Spi!)
The Japanese national team, which won six medals at the 25th World Championship (Switzerland Basel), held a badminton big event in August, will compete in the Chinese OP (Joshu/Super1000) starting from September 17.
Here, we will look back on the first half of the game from May to August when the Olympic race for next year's Tokyo Olympics starts, and look forward to the men's singles for the middle game (September-December) (Badminton Magazine Editorial Department).
Badminton's Olympic race, which began in May, ditched the top four races (over Super500) that the top players competed at the end of the World Championships.
In the first half of the game, Kengo Momoda, who won two of the four tournaments, and Shutenjo (Chiang Tienchen) in Taiwan, were the key players.
Momoda won the world championship, and Shutennari won the tournament in Indonesia OP (S1000) and the high point of "World Ranking Point" directly linked to the Olympic race.
Momoda also took control of Japan OP (S750).
The four tournaments that have been competing since May include the Sudirman Cup (May / China), Indonesia OP (July / More than 16 results), Japan OP (July) and the World Championship (August).
Although the number of top players is small compared to other top players, it is a schedule that reduces the burden on the body.
As August was just one of the World Championships, it would not be much more exhausted than during the war.
A good result is required in the middle game where the top tournaments from September onwards continue.
Taiwan's Ace is resistant to a series of battles.
Pay attention to the young people in Thailand!
Shutennari, who also won the top tournaments of Indonesia OP and Thailand OP (S500), has already participated in seven tournaments.
He also participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) at the beginning of September and won the championship.
Athletes who are physically strong and do not suffer from a series of battles.
Even if the tournament continues, there is no big problem with the performance of the game.
Rather, the ability to earn high points in the first half of the game will make it easier to adjust the schedule of the upcoming tournament.
Shutenjo had a lack of explosive power until last year, but this year, thanks to the increased stability on the play side, he was able to continue to achieve good results firmly.
For Momoda, who ranks first in the world ranking, it is likely to be more troublesome than ever.
In addition to these two players, the first half of the game resulted in young Thai Ace Cantafon and Indian Cyprus B.
And they are three players of Anders Antonsen, who are fighting for the ordnance as a European force.
Although Cantafon did not advance to the finals at the top of the competition, it has been gaining the power to advance to the top, such as entering the top 4 in this season's two tournaments.
There’s still a rough side to it, but the 20-year-old (21-year-old on the 18th) who is able to rally equally against the top players seems to have a lot of potential for leaps and bounds in the Olympic race.
Si Planice B. has also taken a step out of India, where singles have their favorite players.
Samil Barama, Pranoy H.S. , and Sliccans Kidambi, who are late for the injury, should be wary of the Indians after the midfield.
Hokkai Shimbun Says New Pricing for Mobile Phones Will Cut Prices in Fair Competition | Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan
A new pricing plan for mobile phone companies has been set up following the enforcement of the revised Telecommunications Business Act in October.
However, it was generally stopped high.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said last summer that there was room for a 40% reduction, and despite the increasing expectations for a price reduction, there was no price competition.
The major factor is that Rakuten's full-scale entry into the market has been postponed, and the three major companies continue to be stewards.
It is desirable for consumers to have an easy-to-use pricing system due to fair competition.
I would like to seek the efforts of the mobile companies.
The amended law prohibits the set discount of the terminal fee and the communication fee.
Instead of selling the device at a low price, the communication fee was set to be much higher.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) have announced plans to charge up to half the price of the device.
But both companies have a “SIM lock” on their phones that can’t be used for 100 days.
NTT DOCOMO will make up to a third of the price of the device available only to subscribers on its own line.
It seems that the three companies continue to "enclosure" to prevent the transfer to other companies.
The Department of Internal Affairs and Communications said it would require SIM locks to be released immediately.
Companies need to respond as soon as possible.
The postponement of Rakuten was due to the fact that the maintenance of the communication network, such as the base station, did not proceed as planned.
Just because it was expected to be an explosive in the price-cutting competition, it looks like it’s on its shoulders.
I wonder if there was a sweet prospect.
The timing and pricing of the full-fledged service has not been disclosed.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, we want you to take responsibility for your business.
The reimbursement of the fee was triggered by the remarks of Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga.
Suga complained about the new pricing for the three companies, saying, "I think the competition will start from now on. I don't think it's okay at all," he said.
However, I do not think that the "government-made price reduction" will distort the market and promote healthy competition.
Companies should engage in customer-oriented competition before they can be whistleblowered by the government.
The pricing structure of each company is very complicated and not easy to compare.
Consumers are expected to pay more than half the price of the device, even if the device is advertised to be “up to half the price,” according to the Consumer Affairs Agency.
Companies must be polite and easy-to-understand explanations so that they do not create misunderstandings of the users themselves.
Ise Shimbun lowers withdrawal limit to 500,000 yen
The three credit safes in Mie Prefecture have decided to lower their withdrawal limit by using cash cards to prevent the damage caused by special fraud, the sources said Thursday.
The maximum amount that can be withdrawn by cash card is 500,000 yen for depositors at the age of 70 or older who have held cash cards at the credit vaults of Mitsue Kuwana, Ueno Kita Ise and Kihoku, and have not made withdrawal transactions at a certain amount or more at an ATM (an automatic cash deposit machine) for the past three years.
The Kuwana Sanju Shinkin and Kita Ise Ueno Shinkin will be lowered on October 1 and the Kihoku Shinkin will be lowered on November 1.
In the prefecture, there are many special fraud cases in which cash cards and PINs are removed and withdrawals are made at ATMs, including financial institutions and police officials, and people in the credit vault say that they "want to protect customers' important deposits in the most possible way possible".
Izutsu Chikakata's sudden transfer to Mutsu room, including Tsurutatsu YOKOtsuna |Shizuoka Shimbun Atsushi
The Japanese Sumo Association said Tuesday it approved the transfer of three sumo wrestlers, including Tsurutatsu Yokozuna, to the Mutsu room in Izutsu room, following the death of Chikakata ITSUTSU (former Kanwaki Revolt).
The Mutsu room is the same as the Izutsu room and the Tokitsufu family.
His master Chikakata MUTSU (formerly Ozeki Kirishima) was a brother and son of Chikakata ITSUTSUKI, who was from the Izutsu room.
Chikakata ITSUTSU died suddenly on the 16th, and Tsurutatsu and others were temporarily in charge of the Kagamiyama room of the same family, and future treatment was discussed.
There are 12 sumo wrestlers in the Mutsu room, including Mt. Kirima from Mongolia, the same as Tsururyu.
Rugby World Cup: U.S. player's "face-danger tackle" and overseas ripple "The ANSWER" - Yahoo!
U.S. FL Quill Rafts Rough Play, Ex-England Representative Says It Can’t Be Called “Tackle”
The U. S. , the last to appear in 20 countries, lost 7-45 to England in the Rugby World Cup.
It was launched as a black star, but a rough play played by FL John Quill in the second half of the year has sparked waves.
A one-shot exit in the form of adding a shoulder tackle to the opponent's face.
Foreign media also released the actual scene with a video, and former England representatives also complained that it was "an insulting and awkward play" and that it was "not a tackle".
[Video ] "Insulting and awkward play" and overseas ripples!
The Face-Dangerous Tackle Played by the U.S.'s Quill
Hot fighting has crossed the line.
It’s the second half of 29 minutes I’ve greeted you at 0-38.
Deep in the enemy's position, England's captain Farrell was somewhat disbalanced when catching his allies' paths.
This was the quill that went to the tackle.
However, he raised the upper body rather than the lower body from the waist, and hit the upper body violently.
As a result, the head of the opponent comes into contact with the head, and it looks like a head stick.
Farrell was blown up and fell.
An English player tried to get out of the quill in a play that clearly lacked legitimacy.
The two fighters gathered all at once, and it became an instantaneous air.
As a result of TMO (Video Judgment), the quill was left with a red card.
The bats left the pitch with a bad face, but some of the spectators asked for a fair play.
Rugby's powerful New Zealand local media "staff" featured the headline " Rugby World Cup 2019: U. S. players left the game with a poor play, England wins nicely".
Kil did a poor shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell, and he was withdrawn"It was almost a battle between both sides" reported.
The article introduces comments from former England national footballer and commentator Ugo Monya.
It's insulting and awkward. It's not something you can call a tackle. It's an awkward play," he said.
The U. S. , which lacked one player, managed to escape a full loss in its own attempt in 81 minutes.
However, the quill's play left a bad aftertaste.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced for the first time the names of 424 hospitals in 1455 public hospitals across the country and among public hospitals such as Nisshuka, which were judged to have "sufficient medical records".
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare examined the treatment results of 14 public hospitals in the public, and the four facilities of the National Hospital Organization Awara Hospital in Awara City, Ayasakai City Sankoku Hospital, Aya Takahama Hospital, Aya Takahama-cho, Oda Hospital, Aya Echizen-cho.
Four hospitals to be reorganized as 'misleading standards'
In order to reduce the medical expenses that are expanding due to the aging population, it is necessary to promote reorganization and integration with hospitals in competing areas.
In October, the Japanese government requested a full-scale review of the reorganization and integration of the target hospital, and expected the decision to be made by September next year.
It is not compulsory, but fears that nearby hospitals will disappear are expected to repel local chiefs and residents.
It was announced at the meeting on the same day.
The total number of hospitals was 29 to 1%, and there were many hospitals with relatively few beds.
By prefecture, the percentage was high in the order of Niigata (53–7%), Hokkaido (48–6%), Miyagi (47–5%), Yamaguchi (46–7%) and Okayama (43–3%).
The number of subjects was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was the only zero.
Based on FY2017 data, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare surveyed 1,455 public and public hospitals for severely ill patients, and 1,455 hospitals for general surgery.
He analyzed nine medical records, including cancer and emergency care, as well as whether competing hospitals should be located within 20 minutes by car to determine the need to disclose hospital names.
The target hospitals will be considered such as abolishment and transfer of some medical departments to other hospitals.
Medical expenditures are skyrocketing in the 25th year, when the entire population is 75 years old or older.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare aims to reduce the number of beds in hospitals with 1,46,000 beds (18 years) nationwide to 1,191,000 beds.
Currently, the number of beds in the "high acute period" and the "acute period" where nurses are placed thickly and medical expenses are expensive is large, while the number of beds for rehabilitation with high demand for elderly people is lacking.
In order to cope with the aging population, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds, but also to increase the number of beds for rehabilitation.
When it comes to reorganization and integration of hospitals, each prefecture has formulated a regional medical plan that determines the number of beds required for 25 years.
Although the country is divided into 339 areas and discussed by municipalities and medical professionals, many local residents and chiefs remain cautious and difficult to discuss.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare wants to revitalize the debate by disclosing the names of hospitals with poor results.
Comprehensive Disaster Prevention Training for the Presumed Eruption of Mt. Komagatake
A comprehensive disaster drill was held on September 27, assuming the eruption of Mt. Komake (1131 meters) in the forest, Shichii, and Kabe-cho in the Toshima canal.
Approximately 400 people from 20 institutions, including roads and three towns, participated.
The first event was held since the Hokkaido Komagatake Volcano Disaster Prevention Council developed an evacuation plan that included evacuation routes for residents in August.
It is the first time in 18 years that residents participate in wide-area training.
It is assumed that Mt. Komagae erupted at 8:45 a. m. and mud flow reached the town of Yamagata.
When the eruptive alert level was raised to five (evacuation), evacuation centers were opened in both the forest and Shichii town, and residents were moved by buses and road police vehicles prepared by each town.

9 prefectures recommended for pig cholera vaccine: Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Gifu Shimbun Web) - Yahoo!
Japan's Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries has released a proposal to revise its anti-epidesia guidelines to prevent the spread of domestically transmitted pig cholera.
The Japanese government plans to select nine prefectures, including Gifu and Aichi Prefecture, which have been confirmed to be infected with pigs and wild boars.
The movement of live pigs and fertilized eggs vaccinated is restricted within the region, but meat and processed products are allowed to be distributed outside the region.
The plan is to complete the process as early as October, following public comments to the public.
The use of vaccines and the recognition of the extra-regional distribution of meat, such as meat, may not be a "clean country" that has been certified by international organizations and affect the export of pork.
Since the outbreak in September last year, Japan's status as a clean country has temporarily been put on hold.
In the revised plan, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries has set up a "vaccination-recommended area" based on experts' opinions on areas with a high risk of infection with wild boars to pigs.
The relevant prefectures will create a "vaccination program" that summarizes the scope, timing, number of heads, and how to proceed with the vaccination, and will be confirmed by the ministry and allowed to use it at the governor's discretion.
The other seven prefectures listed as recommended regions are Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie, and Shiga.
When the guidelines are amended, the region will make a decision to reconsider the situation.
In principle, the migration of inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, carcasses, and waste is limited within the region.
Meat and processed products are not subjected to the cost of restriction of distribution and impact on farmers, and are effectively allowed to be distributed outside the region.
To thoroughly treat food waste in order not to disperse a virus.
It also appeals to the safety of vaccinated pigs and works to prevent reputational damage.
The proposal for revision of the guidelines was finalized at a meeting of experts held on the same day and confirmed at a meeting of the quarantine headquarters.
In the future, we will hold an opinion inquiry and public comment to the prefecture until October 7 and implement a new quarantine prevention guideline.
Unaffiliated Hiroshi Honda, a public approach to Man U!
Give me an offer. I don't need money.' ( Football Channel ) - Yahoo! News
9/28 (Saturday) 2:57
After leaving Melbourne Victory in the Australian A-League last season, former Japan national team member MF Hiroshi Honda took an amazing action.
Video: Hajime Honda, did you actually play in the game?
the truth is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter account at midnight on Sunday, said, “Please give me an offer. You don’t need money, but you need to play with great teams and great teammates.”
The person who sent the "reverse offer" was Manchester United, a world-renowned brand.
Why did Honda make a grand request to one of the most powerful clubs in the Premier League?
This was triggered by an article in the Australian version of Fox Sports which was released on the 24th.
In an article titled "The Five FWs Manchester United Possible to Acquire in the Crisis of Injuries", five non-existent players who are currently eligible were picked up.
Some of the players, such as Hatem Ben Alpha, Giuseppe Rossi, and Wilfred Bonnie, also had Honda's name.
At present, United has suffered a series of injuries, including MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Shaw, DF Eric Bailey, FW Anthony Marshall, and FW Marcus Rushford.
The "Red Devil", directed by Ole Gunner Soulshal, was forced to slip out of the league with two wins and 22 losses, and was challenged by the quality of the front line.
Accordingly, Honda was named by the Australian media as a candidate for a new battle force.
According to the article, "Strictly speaking, Honda's contract as a creative side player, not a striker, can fill the holes Andreas Perera fills."
His nine goals in 18 games at Melbourne Victory were "a solid record", but it has been pointed out that "33-year-old Honda must stay away from his entertainment to manage the Cambodian national team and gain full attention".
Is Honda’s approach a reality?
It’s also worth noting whether United will move forward for veterans who say their goal is to participate in the Tokyo Olympics next year.
Achievement of 500 Portable Translation Machines for Free at Hamamatsu Shogisho, Stores, etc. | Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan
Poke Talk, a portable translation machine that lends to 500 stores in Hamamatsu City for free
The Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry said Monday that it has completed the installation of a total of 500 machines in stores in Hamamatsu City in a business that lends a portable translation machine "Poke Talk" to its members' offices for free.
This is the first time that the translator has been deployed intensively in the same region, and it is noted whether it will improve the ability to respond inbound (visit travellers to Japan).
Among the lenders are restaurants 236, retail stores 113, accommodations 17, and 134 others.
Naka-ku, in the same city, accounts for 60% of the total.
Google Maps, a Google Maps app, is now available for rent, as well as a smartphone that can tell you where you are in a foreign-language store.
It is accessible from the site of Lake Hamana sightseeing area and so on.
The free loan of Poketalk, which corresponds to 74 languages, was started in April in response to the Declaration of "Hamamatsu, Japan's largest inbound support city" by nine organizations in the city.
The Chamber of Commerce purchases 500 of them and lends them to small and medium-sized businesses for two years that meet conditions such as receiving hospitality certification and introducing cashless payments.
While the business environment is severe, we would like to connect with the development of new foreign customers," said a representative at the Chamber of Commerce.
now, ikemura kanze, nao dora's expert, doesn't need a tieup for the first hit?
mr. caddy's best shot today.
A 1W shot doesn’t necessarily tie up and hit.
There is also the technique of hitting the ball on the ground when you want to earn a distance, such as the second hit of the par 5, so-called "direct drag".
These days, 1W has a high head volume, which puts balls at risk, but some players also practice it frequently on the tee ground.
It is Kanze Ikemura who can wait for the first victory of the tour.
His seven-year-old, 24-year-old was 166 cm tall, but he is currently in seventh place in the driving distance category (average 304.02yd).
While good at long shots, one of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
In spring, I opened my eyes and said, “I didn’t want to shoot a spoon (3W), so I wanted to try straight Dra.
From the practice round, the ball is popped down on the turf in the Ti area and sometimes the 1W is cut off.
In cases where big carry is required, tie-up is often used, but direct dredgers are effectively utilized in holes where both sides are narrow.
It can be used in halls where the eyes are knocked down.
The ballistic instrument recorded 270yd to 280yd in Carrie.
That's why I don't need 3W. Caddy is more comfortable with Dra Dra than 3W ..."
From the "Japan Tour Championship" in June, the only wood in the caddy bag is 1W.
The second longest club is the Loft 17-degree UT.
I am also glad to hear the admiration that leaks from the gallery that I saw in the strategy that surprises my fellow tour members.
The trick is to swing the club to the level (horizontal).
“Even if you’re downbroken or hit with an upper, you don’t fly straight. If you’re in a cut orbit, you’re going to go to the right. Originally, you’re doing a straight drag to correct the swing of a 1W shot (at the time of the tie-up). This practice also makes the attack angle (the angle of the club’s incidence) loosen.”
The ball is not caught and comes with a risk of slices, but "so the left side can be erased (not bent to the left). "
It's a professional technique that I can't help but think about.

Why do adults laugh and threaten their children?’ Greta Tombelli raises a question on Twitter.
Swedish environmental activist Greta Tombelli gave a speech at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York on September 23.
While the speech is attracting attention, there is an insulting message about Mr. Greta.
Greta Tombelli: Why adults laugh and threaten their children
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption"I'm mentally ill. My parents and international left wings are being used," a political critic said in an American television show.
In Japan, there is a lot of discussion on the internet that criticizes the part that is not the content of Greta's remarks, such as "I'm sorry I'm using it" and "I'd better go to school".
On September 26, Greta posted on Twitter, "Why do adults spend time laughtering and threatening teenagers and children?"
i'll come up with as many lies and conspiracy theories as i can think of.
Greta said, "Hey, it started again. As you notice, the people who dislike me are still active. My looks, my clothes, my attitudes, and I chase them around in different ways. They come up with as many lies and conspiracy theories as they can think of."
He continued, noting that adults do not want to face climate and environmental crises, and that they seem to be distorting the point of discussion.
To be honest, I don’t understand why adults spend time laughtering and threatening teenagers and children.
You can do another good thing at that time.
I think they feel threatened by us.
But don’t spend your time paying more attention to them.
The world is starting to wake up.
Change is coming.
Whether an adult likes the change or not.
Let's meet on the street on Friday!
Climate change strikes took place in New York and around the world on Friday, the 20th of last week.
Greta called for it to be held on Friday, the 27th.

Video: Come to Japan!
gulcia's wedge shot.
Since I was able to stretch to some extent in the first half, I thought that I could go with that momentum in the second half, but the putter was not able to stretch well, so it was regrettable there.
Did you see the victory at Eagle 6 and Bardy 7?
Even after hitting the bogie at number 4, there was also a par 5 left, so if I did it with the desire to get it back, the chip-in-eagle came in number 6.
I was able to get a chance to catch Burdy at number 7, but I regret that I couldn't extend it in the second half after all.
-- What did you get at this tournament?
Recently (shot) was not good, so it was good that the fairway was able to keep firmly even on a narrow course.
Since the ruff was a course where the order and inverse were different and the way of hitting and the distance changed, I did not have much (experience) so I learned quite a lot.
-- What is the difference from the usual tournament?
It was a place where it was possible to shoot a camera (e. g. , a smartphone).
I didn't care about myself at all, but the gallery was pretty good at taking videos and so on.
Other than that, there were not many things that changed, but because it is a competition where there are few Japanese players who are co-hosted, I faced the game with the feeling that "I will not lose to overseas players" for that amount.
The second half of the game will continue from now on, but if you do not win more than one win, you can not aim for the prize winner, so I want to raise one more win, and since there is also a ZOZO championship nearby, I will try my best so that you can get to the top in the tournament so far and qualify for the competition.
How to prevent dementia and keep it as "forgotten" as possible?
Interview/Bun/Yo WATANABE
It is a drug for dementia that major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals are struggling with research and development.
However, it seems that the relationship between dementia and lifestyle is becoming clearer, and it is possible that it can be kept to the extent that it is extremely mild, forgetful.
i talked to professor daijo shunsuke of the stroke center at the kinki university hospital.
dementia won't go away.
- Dementia prevention or treatment is awaited, what is the current situation?
Otaru From mild to severe, there is a difference in the degree, and it is possible to become dementia when everyone ages.
However, it is believed that it will take more than 20 years for new dementia drugs to be developed.
Donepezil, a drug that is often used in Japan, is already out of insurance in some countries overseas, so it is not expected to have a remarkable cure effect.
On the other hand, as deaths due to infectious diseases and accidents have decreased, and cancer deaths have also decreased due to the remarkable progress of treatment of anticancer drugs, etc.
Therefore, it is also true that the number of patients with dementia is increasing.
It is necessary to establish an environment in which the entire society can live with peace of mind in the region as a whole, not only for the real person and family to be able to solve it.
a method of holding something as 'forgotten'
-- Are there people who are prone to dementia, or those who are prone to dementia?
Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, there is a possibility that you can suppress the symptoms as much as possible and keep it as "forgotten".
Dementia is considered to be a lifestyle disease, and tends to be a person who is prone to it.
First of all, metabolic people tend to be prone to dementia.
Dementia is regarded as one of lifestyle diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.
The presence or absence of economic power also affects.
For example, in the U. S. , there are regions where food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets are stored in frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens.
It can be used by people who can not use gas or electricity and live in an environment where they can not cook in the first place.
Then, it becomes a diet with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a life biased to lipids and sugars.
Eventually, it becomes poor but obese, and the only thing to do is to stare at the TV, and the body becomes inconvenient.
A similar situation can be found in Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things or do not work tend to be prone to dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, you need to read a book every day and think about things that are not metabolic.
