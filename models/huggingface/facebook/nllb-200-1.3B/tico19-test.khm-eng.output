Rapid increase in COVID-19 cases in the European Union/EEA and the UK from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The rise in coronavirus (COVID-19) cases is showing similarities across EU/EEA countries, and the UK has stated that while at different stages depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is evolving rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience from Italy, countries, hospitals and care institutions should increase preparedness for the surge in COVID-19 patients who will require health care and especially intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a case of pneumonia, the cause of which is unknown, was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the causative agent as a new type of coronavirus, referred to as SARS-CoV-2.
Since then, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection has been named Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far is that 80% of those with COVID-19 have mild disease, i.e. respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, and the majority of these patients recover.
In 14 percent of cases, COVID-19 evolves into a severe illness requiring hospitalization, while another 6% have a severe illness requiring the most intensive care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we assessed the trend of increasing incidence of COVID-19 infection in each of the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom and compared them to Hubei, China.
We also compared the current number of cases of COVID-19 infection in the countries of the European Union/EEA and the United Kingdom with the number of cases in Italy during the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in countries of the European Union/EEA and the United Kingdom.
After hitting China, COVID-19 has continued to spread, and the rapid COVID-19 pandemic around the world is currently following China's lead.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a global pandemic.
In the Eurosurveillance 2020 5th edition, Spiteri and others reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe, based on the WHO case definition.
In Europe/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 to people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected in 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, where between 31 December 2019 and that date 39,768 cases of the disease have been reported, and 1,727 cases of death have been reported, of which 17,750 cases of infection and 1,441 of deaths were from Italy alone.
Take the total number and incidence as a progression of the number of COVID-19 cases.
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the count of reported COVID-19 cases in each country worldwide, obtained from official sources such as the Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities, and the World Health Organization, is updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
All of these data were used in the evaluation of COVID-19 outbreaks in EU/EEA countries as well as the United Kingdom and compared all of these data with data from Italy.
As a representative of the active COVID-19 pandemic, we calculated the sequential occurrence of COVID-19 cases that stabilized at 14 days, taking into account the normal course of COVID-19 infection in each country of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom during the period 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also show the increase in the number of individual cases reported on 15 March 2020 at 8:00 am compared to Italy during the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
The situation of COVID-19 in the European Union/EEA and the United Kingdom
The trend in COVID-19 cases occurring over approximately 14 days in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom follows the trend in Hubei (China) (Figure 1).
For the European Union/EEA and the United Kingdom as a whole, the incidence of COVID-19 outbreaks began to rise around 21 February and then sharply increased on 28 February 2020.
This was largely driven by the rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but the European Union/EEA and the United Kingdom have shown a similar increase in the progressive increase in the incidence of COVID-19.
Figure 2 shows the total overlap of COVID-19 cases in the European Union/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, compared to Italy for 31 January - 15 March 2020.
The report notes that as of 8:00 a.m. on 15 March, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom reported a lower number of cases, compared to the number of cases in Italy, which was only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results show that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is rapidly increasing in the countries of the European Union/EEA and the United Kingdom.
The observed trend in the occurrence of COVID-19 shows that the pandemic is evolving at a relatively similar pace in all countries.
This is in contrast to countries that are in different stages, changing national public health responses and different case definitions in countries, and different procedures for selecting patients to be tested for COVID-19 infection, including testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the hardest hit areas of Italy reported the situation in the region that 10% of COVID-19 patients were demanding intensive care, and multiple sources reported that hospitals as well as intensive care units in those areas were doing their best.
Data on the admission of COVID-19 cases in hospitals and/or intensive care units are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not disclosed).
However, they should be collected systematically to supplement current tracking data focused on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
Studies carried out in 2010-11 showed a large variation in the availability of intensive care and medium-sized nursing beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 inhabitants in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (average 12.5 care places and nursing beds per 100,000 population in 2010-11).
Model scenarios involving healthcare disability are given in the ECDC's new sixth Rapid Risk Assessment of COVID-19, with estimates for EU/EEA and UK countries that COVID-19 admissions are at risk of exceeding critical care capacity by &gt;90%.
As many cases have been concentrated in a few regions in the European Union, the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and care units typically serve only the population of a designated area, information on cases and care coordinators should be provided on the website of the Territorial Unit for Status 2 (NUTS-2).
Experience from Italy and current assessments in other countries have shown that the global epidemic of COVID-19 is evolving rapidly in the countries of the European Union/EEA and the United Kingdom.
Countries, hospitals and care institutions should therefore be prepared for the new scenario of community transmission of the potentially chronic SARS-CoV-2 virus and the increasing number of COVID-19 patients requiring health care and especially high-level care, such as a case that is occurring in the affected areas in Italy.
As indicated in the new ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, a rapid, appropriate and comprehensive response approach is essential in delaying the spread of SARS-COV-2-virus, shifting from containment to mitigation approaches, while the rapid increase in the number of cases may not give decision-makers and hospitals sufficient time to understand, accept and respond appropriately if not implemented early and promptly.
The assessment of the immediate risk also includes public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window in which countries can further step up their management efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on healthcare institutions.
If this fails, the healthcare systems of the EU/other European economies may face a surge in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in catastrophic human deaths.
The virus is similar to its unique co-infection with SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003.SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted from mice and causes similar symptoms through mechanisms similar to SARS-CoV.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, but is more contagious and affects older people more than younger people, and men more than women.
In response to the growing number of publications on the spreading disease, this article seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive overview of the rapidly evolving research topic.
We will talk about the basics of disease, its pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention.
While many questions remain unanswered, we hope this review will help us understand and help combat this threatening disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020, has become an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all Chinese, who have been urged to stay indoors for the holidays and for weeks after the outbreak of the new virus.
The virus is similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003.It was therefore named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the other related disease was named CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The outbreak first started in Wuhan, China, with rapid spread across the country and to about 50 countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus has caused 80,000 cases of COVID-19 infection, with over 40,000 patients discharged from hospital and over 3,000 patients dead.
The World Health Organization warns that COVID-19 is public enemy No. 1 and has more potential than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 studies have been published on COVID-19, including studies of infection, causes, diagnosis, and treatment since the first report on January 7, 2020, which isolated the virus from a variety of infectious agents.
The review attempts to shorten the evolution of research in new, rapidly evolving disciplines.
Where possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS, another disease caused by the coronavirus (CoV), the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, which broke out in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned regarding prevention and prediction of disease as well as questions we need to answer urgently.
CoVs are usually considered harmless pathogens to humans, most of which cause the common flu, about 15% of influenza 4.
However, in this century, we have seen twice as many human-borne coronaviruses (CoVs), SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused the first outbreaks in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, and then spread to many other countries with greater severity and mortality rates.
Thus, COVID-19 is currently the third coronavirus outbreak in recorded human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, a batch of pneumonia patients of unknown origin was first reported from Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the sequence of the coronavirus (CoV) was released.
On 15 January 2020, the first death from Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic has spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, infection of healthcare providers was reported, confirming that human-to-human transmission is possible.
On 23 January, Wuhan was closed to public transport.
On 24 January, the first clinical trial study into the disease revealed that of all 41 infected patients, only 21 were in direct contact with Wuhan's seafood market, which is considered a source of infection from unknown animals.
On 30 January, the World Health Organization declared the pandemic a global health emergency.
As of the time of this report, the disease had spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries in the world (Figure 2).2
As the situation is evolving rapidly, the latest outbreak and severity continues to be monitored very closely.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-centre study of 8866 patients, of which 4021 patients were confirmed to have COVID-19, showed the following prevalence of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHP1XaqHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infections are of all ages, but most occur in the 30-65 age group.
Almost half (47.7%) of the infected were over 50 years old, very few were under 20 years old, and only 14 of the infected were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has spread in clusters mostly in and around Hubei province.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The average incubation period is approximately 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basal cell count (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the correction R0 is 2.23-4.82.
The number of infections increased significantly before 23 January 2020, which is the time of the mass transit before the Chinese Spring Festival.
The mortality rate of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the coordinated mortality rate of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender, age 60 and older, and those with severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses, or CoVs, are large, round-shell viruses that contain a single RNA.
They can be divided into four genera, alpha-beta-gamma and beta-beta, and beta-CoVs are known to be transmissible to humans.
The spike (S) protein binds to the receptor cell-stimulating enzymes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively, and subsequent fusion of the compounds has occurred.
The RNA gene is then transferred to the cytoplasm. After the virus is broken down, the RNA gene, surrounded by glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, forms tiny water molecules that dissolve with the plasma to release the virus.
The first gene sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a new strain of beta-CoV with a genetic identity of over 99.98% in 10 sequential samples collected from the original site of the outbreak, the Hunan seafood market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through microwave electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the uppermost part of the epithelium of the human respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 has been found to be a receptor agonist for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S-protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus binds to human ACE2 more weakly than binding to the SARS-CoV, which is contradicted by the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 may also form a new short-chain protein encoded by orf3b and a secretory protein encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in viral pathogenesis and inhibit the release of IFNβ. However, orf8 has no known functional domain or pattern.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou and others reported a cryoEM structure of the full-size human ACE2 at 2.9 A with a complex containing B0AT1 amino acid transporter.
They found that it is a complex of open and closed conformations, fed as a dimer, and the ACE2-B0AT1 complex binds to two S-proteins, all of which provide evidence in the recognition and transmission of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target for drug screening to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The first and middle leaves
It is known that both SARS-CoV originated from bats and was transmitted to humans through civet and MERS-CoV originated from bats.
By comparing the phylogenetic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, bats are considered to be the original replicant of SARS-CoV-2 as the new virus is 96% identical to the coronaviruses, which are similar to two SARS viruses derived from bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, what mediators helped the virus pass from animals to humans are still unknown, and its transmission pathways are still unclear.
Ji and others suggested that elephants were the transmitters of the virus from bats to humans, which involved the recombination of similarity in the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, have shown that the long-beaked, spiny-clawed parasite commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine, the common mid-type of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is potentially 99% identical in genetic characteristics to the corona virus found in the poultry and the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
However, the 1% difference that spread to the two genomes is still a large difference. Therefore, the consensus conclusion for the empirical evidence is awaited (Figure 33).
The chemistry of SARS-CoV-2 is not well known.
The SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses can survive for 48 hours in a dry environment, and they survive for 5 days at 20 °C and 40%-50% humidity.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus may be similar in nature.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is resistant to ultraviolet radiation and heating at 56 °C for 30 minutes.Ethylene (ether) ethanol 75% disinfectant containing perocetic acid, chlorophyll and other non-chlorhexidine fatty acids can inactivate the virus.
The global population is generally immune to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new virus.
No detailed studies have been reported on the immune system response to SARS-CoV-2 at present.
So we just looked at previous studies on other CoVs, specifically SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
Generally, after the virus enters the host, it is first recognized by the host's internal immune system via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including C-type lectin-like receptors, Toll-like receptor (TLR), receptor-like-NOD (NLR) and RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) receptors.
In various ways, the virus induces the release of inflammatory agents, the maturation of dendritic cells, and the expression of type I interferon neurons (IFNs), which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis macrophasis of the virus's antibodies.
However, the N-protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus escape the immune system.
Soon, an adaptive immune response will be engaged to fight the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in the body's defense.
CD4+T cells stimulate B cells to form a special antibody against a specific virus, and CDC8+T cells kill the virus on their own.
Helper T cells produce anti-inflammatory cytokines to aid the immune cells.
However, coronaviruses can inhibit T cell function by inducing a form of T cell death.
The human immune system including C3a and C5a receptors and host cells are also important in fighting viral transmission.
For example, tissue extracted from recovered patients has restored MERS-CoV to normal.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system generates a substantial amount of free radicals at the base, which can cause severe damage to the liver and other organs and, in the worst-case scenario, multiple organ failure and death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by a cluster of symptomatic onset, is more likely to affect older, sick adults and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or who have a weak immune system to have a higher chance of infection than others.
The average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, with most being 3-7 days based on a study of 425 initial cases in Wuhan.
However, a 1099 case study showed that the incubation period was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A further recent study, as described above, showed the incubation period of the disease to be 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) based on a population of 8,866 cases.
It is critical for health authorities to adjust effective screening times based on the most accurate wake-up time, so it protects those who are infected but have no symptoms from transmitting the virus to others.
In normal practice, individuals who are infected or infected with the coronavirus are usually required to undergo a 14-day radiation test.
Should I quarantine for 24 days?
The common cold is the first and primary symptom of COVID-19 disease, which may be asymptomatic or accompanied by other symptoms such as dry throat, shortness of breath, muscle aches, headaches, dizziness, facial pain, vomiting, chest pain, dizziness, and cough.
Some patients have had problems with nausea and/or lack of oxygen in the blood within a week of the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients begin to develop symptoms of shortness of breath, reactive hyperactivity, acid reflux, hyperhidrosis, and clotting.
Patients with fever and/or symptoms of respiratory illness and severe fever, even in the absence of abnormalities of the pulmonary picture, should be screened for germs for initial diagnosis.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 showed that the proportion of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for cough, 55% for acne and 3% for cancer, and 8% of patients needed an inlet air supply.
Similar studies have shown that two recent studies of a family and a cohort of people caused infection from asymptomatic individuals.
Compared to demographic studies in 2012, MERS-CoV patients had 98% fever, 47% dry cough, 55% wheezing, which were their primary symptoms.
However, 80% of these patients require more ventilation than COVID-19 patients and are similar to MERS, which is more deadly than COVID-19.
Cancer (26%) and gastroenteritis (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In SARS patients, it was shown that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), runny nose (40%-42%), asthma (20-25%) and abdominal pain (13-25%) were common symptoms, and inward ventilation support was required for approximately 14%-20% of patients.
As of 14 February, COVID-19 mortality was 2%, while confirmed cases were 66,576 worldwide.
Compared to the SARS mortality rate as of November 2002, which was 10% of confirmed cases, 8,096 cases were reported.
For MERS based on demographic studies in June 2012, the mortality rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
Previous studies reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 virus was as high as 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71 to 7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV virus was only between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of its morphology and R0 is shown in Table 1.1
The figures above show that SARS-CoV-2 is more capable than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in spreading, but less deadly than the latter two.
It is therefore more difficult to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The onset of disease is either family-specific or occurs in a group or in a single-passage, such as a tourist boat, etc.
Patients generally have a history of traveling or staying in Wuhan or other affected areas, or have been in contact with an infected individual or patient in the two weeks prior to onset of illness.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without showing any symptoms for more than two weeks, and patients who have recovered and are discharged from the hospital can carry the virus again, suggesting a declaration of emergency to increase the time for surgery.
Patients may have normal or decreased lymphocytes in the early stages.
For example, lymphocytes with a 4×109/L blood cell count, including 1×109/L lymphocytes, and the presence of the virus in the blood and elevated levels of aspartame amino acids were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Liver, muscle and myoglobin levels of enzymes have increased in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and electrocyte sedimentation have also increased in the blood of some patients.
In severe cases, the levels of D-dimer, a weak product of fibrin, in the blood are elevated and the number of lymphocytes is gradually reduced.
An abnormality in chest X-ray imaging was found in most COVID-19 patients and was characterized by a double-blind mirror or a thin lining on the lung.
Patients often develop abnormal pneumonia, vertical lung injury and symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When severe respiratory symptoms occur, uncontrollable inflammation, fluid buildup and progression to pneumonia can make it impossible to move gas or air in the body.
Irregularity of type I and type II pneumocytes leads to a decrease in surfactant levels and increases surface tension, thereby reducing lung capacity, preventing growth and increasing the risk of lung damage.
Thus, the worst chest X-ray detection results are often consistent with the most severe stage of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, a second diagnostic analysis of COVID-19 showed the breakdown of pneumocytes, the occurrence of coagulation and penetration of interstitial lymph nodes and multi-cellular respiratory cells in the lungs of patients who died of the disease, consistent with the pathogenesis of the disease and ARDS and similar to the pathogenesis of the infection of SARS and MERS.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through trans-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used as a key diagnostic criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to high false positives that could accelerate the spread, clinical screening was started for diagnostics (which does not rely solely on RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation has occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, the combination of the disease history, the results of the actual tests, the results of the laboratory tests, the X-rays are important and useful for an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the team described a ceremony using CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technology to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which detects SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 rule per micron of input) using a chemical-measuring probe in less than an hour without the need for a powerful instrument.
It is hoped that this new technique can facilitate understanding of key points and provide convenience if embedded in a real-world experimental test sample.
Due to the lack of experience in treating this coronavirus, doctors have only been able to provide follow-up care to COVID-19 patients while trying to test many of the therapies that were previously used or recommended for the treatment of other coronavirus (CoVs) such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases. (Table (Table2)).
These treatments include current and potential treatment with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine, and psychosocial support.
Even plasma from recovered patients is suggested for treatment.
Many pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop a vaccine and a vaccine against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 initially attacks the lung tissue at an early stage and continues to attack other ACE2-expressing tissues, such as the digestive system and kidneys.
However, dysfunction and respiratory failure are a major threat to patients and are also the leading causes of death.
Thus, respiratory support is essential to alleviate symptoms and save lives and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-concentrated inlet and outlet ventilation, and mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a technique to support the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems used in the treatment of life-threatening cardiac arrest and respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating post-infection and viral reactions, and protecting vital organ function are all essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is known that typhoid fever is caused by a strong immune system reaction to SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine attack is a form of systemic inflammatory response expressed by the release of a series of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines stimulate immune cells to release large amounts of free radicals, which are the cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine storm, especially in patients with severe conditions.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an IL6 monoclonal antibody, are used to treat cytopenia.
Other immunosuppressant treatments for cytokines include coordination of T-cell-directed immune responses, inhibition of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF, inhibition of JAK, use of the drug blinatumomab, suppression of cytokine-releasing signaling 4, and inhibition of HDAC.
Steroids, which are immunosuppressants, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severe relapses that affect inflammation.
However, high-dose steroids are not useful in treating severe liver injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, especially osteoporosis, which affects prognosis.
However, short-term use of low-to-moderate-dose corticosteroids is recommended with the utmost caution for severe COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, there is no proven effective antiviral treatment.
However, intravenous injection of the nucleotide analogue drug Remdesivir was found to be effective in one US COVID-19 patient.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug developed by Gilead Biopharmaceuticals initially for the treatment of diseases caused by the Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir also showed potential to inhibit RNA viruses that bind together, including MERS and SARS.
Based on all this, Gilead has provided China with the facility to conduct two human-infected SARS-CoV-2 trials, and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with mild respiratory symptoms.
Renal irritation, nausea, liver cell damage and other activities may occur after lopinavir/ritonavir combination therapy.
The interaction of these treatments with other medications used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from recovered patients and organ formation
Collecting blood from recovering patients to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from infection has a long history.
In fact, recovered patients have high levels of antibodies to the pathogen in their blood.
The body's immune system is made up of immunoglobulins (ig) produced by B cells to fight off pathogens as well as foreign substances that are not in the body, and they can be able to identify which molecules cause disease and they kill those molecules directly.
Based on this, plasma collected from the blood of patients recovering from COVID-19 will be injected into 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms improve within 24 hours, with decreased inflammation and viral load and improved oxygenation in the blood.
However, testing and validation are necessary to propose a method for large-scale use before a specific treatment has been developed.
Moreover, due to the therapeutic effects, some of the properties associated with the plasma should be considered with caution.
For example, the body can override the immune system response and trigger the release of cytokines, which can lead to lethal toxicity.
The levels of antibodies in the blood are usually low and require high plasma levels for the treatment of patients with severe levels.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific organisms fast enough to fight the spread of the disease worldwide.
It is therefore more important and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify the genes that have implanted the antibody or to screen for antibodies that are effective against the main protein of the virus.
This way we can increase the production of organic compounds very quickly.
TCM has been used to treat various ailments in China for thousands of years.
However, its effects mostly depend on the combination of multiple compounds in one form, which varies depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on the theory of TCM.
Most of the active ingredients are still unknown or unclear because it is difficult to extract and store such ingredients or to store them optimally.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM has become an important alternative treatment for patients with mild or moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from the severe stage.
For example, the herbal medicine Zofengido and the herbal medicine Huexingwen have been found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The highest recovery rates in treating COVID-19 patients were observed in some provinces in China, with 87% of patients using TCM, those from Guangzhou (63.7%), Ningxi (50%) and Hunan (50%), and Hubei Province, which used TCM in about 30% of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a quick comparison, as many other factors such as the number and severity of patients should be included in the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Bullichang and colleagues published a study comparing Western-style therapy (WM) alone with combined WM and TCM therapy.
They found that the time required for the baseline body temperature cycles, symptom resolution and hospital stay for the WM+TCM group was shorter than for the WM group.
Most interestingly, the rate of symptom worsening (from mild to severe) was notable for the WM+ TCM group, which was lower than the WM group (7.4% vs. 46.2%), and the low mortality rate for the WM+ TCM group, which was lower than the WM group (8.8% vs. 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of TCM still await large-scale, well-managed clinical trials at many other centers.
It is also interesting to define the mechanism of action and to establish the efficacy components of treatment by TCM or its combination therapies if possible.
Patients who suspect or confirm COVID-19 are often extremely fearful of the infection and potentially life-threatening, and people who are isolated are often overwhelmed, lonely and angry.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, shortness of breath and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatment such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can cause increased anxiety and emotional distress.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a number of serious psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, panic attacks, depression, fainting, and suicide have been reported.
The mandatory exposure monitoring and quarantine, which is part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, can leave some people feeling depressed and misinformed about the impact of the infection, quarantine and strong stigma on their family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected patients and those in contact with them, as well as the general public who are in need of care.
Psychosocial support should include the establishment of a multi-disciplinary mental health team, clear communication with regular and timely updates on treatment plans and the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, and the use of expert electronic devices and software to avoid close or overly intimate contact.
Effective vaccines are important in preventing transmission from infected animals and humans to infectious pathogens, and these vaccines are usually in addition to antiviral therapy to control the outbreak of disease caused by new, recurrent viruses.
Efforts are underway to develop a vaccine from the S protein to create a robust and long-lasting immune system and body against SARS-CoV.
A live vaccine is being evaluated in animal samples for SARS.
However, the efficacy of live vaccines administered in these trials in older adults and risk-adjusted specimens and their protection against zoonotic (animal-to-human) viral transmission must be determined before a practical experimental study is initiated.
This is probably because SARS has been running for 17 years and no new cases have been reported.
In contrast, sporadic and isolated outbreaks of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the lack of genotoxic (animal-to-human) sources in the infected areas.
Vaccine production strategies have been developed for MERS using inactive viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, viral-like microbes, and recombinant protein fragments, and some strategies have been taken to animal testing and evaluation.
The development of an effective and safe vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for immunocompromised individuals is an urgent and critical imperative for the prevention of the pandemic.
However, it remains an obstacle to overcoming this difficult situation because of the long time (generally 18 months) required to develop vaccines and rapidly mutate different variants of CoVs.
As a new strain of COVID-19, it is just beginning to fully manifest itself in clinical trials when the patients were already in the thousands.
In most cases, patients can recover completely without any complications.
However, COVID-19, which is similar to SARS and MERS, has also been associated with high morbidity and mortality rates in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, the development of a predictive model for disease is essential for healthcare agencies to prioritize in their service delivery, especially in resource-poor areas.
Based on the empirical studies reported in the past, some of the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table (Table 33)):
Age: Age is also the most important factor for predicting the likelihood of SARS and COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurs mostly in people aged 30-65, with 47.7% of patients over the age of 50 in the 8,866 case studies described above.
Patients who require high care are more likely to have moderate to severe outcomes and are older than those who do not (average age 66 versus 51), suggesting age is a determining factor for COVID-19 patient outcomes.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infects more males than females (0.31/100,000 vs 0.27/100,000) as described above.
Confusion and disorientation: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from pain from cardiac arrest and severe cardiac arrest.
Heart problems remain the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can penetrate ACE2-positive cholangioctues, causing impaired liver function in COVID-19 patients.
It is also worth noting that age and pre-existing illness are strongly correlated, potentially causing mutual effects.
Laboratory abnormalities: Levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflect the severity of inflammation or lesion damage and have been proposed as a predictor of disease, response to treatment, and eventual recovery.
The correlation of CRP levels to the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 was also cited.
In addition, increases in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict outcomes.
These enzymes are widely expressed in many tissues, especially the heart and liver, and are released during renal failure.
So they're a common symptom for heart or liver failure.
Key clinical clinical symptoms: Chest imaging and the time evolution of clinical clinical symptoms should be considered along with other factors for predicting outcomes and consequences of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immune-suppressant agents that are used in combination therapy for certain infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammation.
High-dose corticosteroid use is used to treat severe SARS patients. Survivors have suffered vascular and bone loss that resulted in lifelong disability or reduced quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and for short durations for COVID-19 patients.
Emotional stress: As described above during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients experienced unusual stress as they endured long and hardships, uncertainty, and seeing the death of close family members and other patients.
It is necessary to provide psychological counseling and long-term support to help these patients overcome stress and return to a normal life.
According to past demographic studies, COVID-19 appears to be distinct from the SARS pandemic.
In addition to transmission in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can also transmit via the upper respiratory tract effectively and cause symptomatic or asymptomatic early-stage infection, which is similar to other coronaviruses that cause the common cold.
Therefore, patients who are infected in the early stages or in the early stages of the disease can produce large amounts of germs during their daily activities, making it difficult to control the disease.
However, transmission or transmission of SARS-CoV is considered to have occurred when the patient was severely ill, whereas most infections did not occur at an early stage.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is more severe and more difficult to control than the outbreak of SARS.
A major effort is currently underway in China, including the closure of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continuous screening of almost all the population in the hope of preventing further spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions have caused damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is declining, indicating a decline in the spread of infection.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end in March and the slowdown phase will last 3-4 months.
However, other experts do not have this view.
Paul Hunter and others predict that COVID-19, which appears to be more contagious than SARS, will not end by 2020.
Ira Longini and others developed a model to predict the outcome of the outbreak and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian team reported that SARS-CoV-2 virus was detected both near the nasal cavities and the ventricles of patients who had recovered and been discharged from hospital two weeks earlier, suggesting that the newly identified virus may be in a flu-like phase.
However, the outbreak signal has emerged in China based on the declining number of new cases, suggesting that the current strategy may be working.
Ebola was initially predicted to cause up to a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, through surgery and isolation, the disease was brought under control.
It is possible, because of its similarity to SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 can weaken infection and eventually dissolve or become a virus that causes disease that is rare in humans.
A comparison between the global outbreaks of COVID-19 with SARS and MERS is shown in the table below (Table 55).
SARS-CoV-2 has a high rate of transmission through coughing, sneezing, or direct contact with objects containing the virus.
The virus has also been found in feces, raising the possibility of a new infection from feces to the mouth.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of the total cases were likely caused by hospital-acquired transmission, with 17 patients having a communicable disease, including 40 healthcare providers.
Therefore, the best precautions should be taken to protect the public, especially healthcare providers, social workers, family members, co-workers, as well as those who come into direct contact with the patient or those who are infected.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is through wearing masks.Both the use of surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (version # 1860s) help control the spread of the virus.
Surgical barriers protect fluid from infecting susceptible individuals by preventing the airborne movement of this fluid or falling on the surface of other objects where it can be passed on to others.
However, only N95 masks (series # 1860s) can protect against penetration of viruses with a small size of 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of viruses can penetrate this mask.SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV, whose wavelength is 85 nm.
Because particles can penetrate even through five stacked surgical masks, health care providers in direct contact with patients must wear N95 masks (released in the mid-1860s), but not surgical masks.
In addition to wearing masks, healthcare providers should wear isolation masks in order to further reduce direct exposure to the virus.
The virus can also be transmitted to a person through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor became infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask.The virus may have entered his body through his swollen eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also wear a face shield or eye protection when operating with patients.
For the general population in areas where the infection is present or is highly contagious, they are all advised to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual and try to stay indoors for self-quarantine and limit contact with individuals who may be infected.
Three feet is considered an appropriate distance for people to stay away from patients.
These actions are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has become a new virus to the human world, its strong similarity to SARS-CoV as reported on 7 January 2020 should have made China more cautious and should have been keenly reminded of the outbreak of SARS in 2003.
However, as of January 19, 2020, the director of the Center for Disease Control in Wuhan had deceived his own citizens by saying that the new virus was low-transmissible, that its transmission was still limited from person to person, and that it had no problem with prevention and resistance to the disease.
This eases the public emergency, especially as the entire country is preparing for the Spring Festival, and it is a critical time missed in containing the disease when it was still in its infancy in Wuhan.
Disease control agencies in China may take this difficult lesson and make bold improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be more cautious when making public announcements because every word is important to citizens and it can change their behavior and decisions; (2) be cautious and respond well to disinformation coming from clinicians rather than waiting for an official report from a doctor or official; (3) be more strict to contain a possible outbreak at an early stage rather than trying to deceive the rest of the public; and (4) more frequently to implement targeted and effective testing to increase public awareness of the disease and to improve the health and social systems of the disease response.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries worldwide at the time of this writing.
Because the virus is similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has created a sense of SARS resurgence.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are necessary for preventing spread and for treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than younger people, men more than women, and the severity and mortality rates for very old patients are also higher than for younger people.
SARS was more deadly than COVID-19 (10.91% vs 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus to others even if they are asymptomatic, whereas SARS patients are asymptomatic when they are severely ill, making it more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains some of the reasons why SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster than SARS-CoV.
The typical RNA strand of SARS-CoV-2 may not be present in some COVID-19 patients.
In addition, patients who have recovered and may have the virus come back positive.
These findings greatly increase the risk of the virus spreading.
With such rapid developments in COVID-19 research, there are some key issues to address:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 originate?
Although 96% of the genetic similarity has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-like viruses from bats, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is from bats.
What is the animal in the middle that can transmit the virus from the original reptile, such as a bat, to humans?
Without knowing answers 1 and 2, we cannot effectively slow down the transmission or transmit, and the outbreak can recur at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical testing have shown that SARS-CoV-2 can mutate and penetrate into ACE2, how the virus can enter the respiratory tract cells causing disease is not yet known.
Can the virus bind ACE2-releasing cells to other tissues?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this pandemic last?
How did the virus evolve during its transmission among humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, or disappear like SARS, or reappear like the bubonic plague?
It's important, but it may take some time to do research to answer the above questions as well as others.
However, whatever the cost, we have no choice but to stop the spread quickly and get our lives back to normal.
The human coronavirus is a zoonotic
Evolution and self-preservation have driven the coexistence of coronavirus (CoVs) and living organisms, including humans, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two human cases of human co-infection with human co-infection with human co-infection with human co-infection with human co-infection with human co-infection with human co-infection with human co-infection with human co-infection with human co-infection with human co-infection with human co-infection with human co-infection with human co-infection with human co-infection with human co-infection with human co-infection with human co-infection with human co-infection with human co-infection with human co-infection with human co-infection with human co-infection with human co-infection with human co-infection with human co-infection with human co-infection with human co-infection with human co-infection with human co-infection with human co-infection with human co-infection with human co-infection.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have shifted the focus to show how dangerous and life-threatening HCoV infection is.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 put the virus back on the hot spot, surprising us with its high prevalence but with a decreased pathogenicity compared to its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a zoonotic disease, and understanding the zoonotic origin of HCoVs can help us.
Most HCoVs originate from bats, which are not pathogens.
A central repository of some HCoVs has been identified.
Animal identification has a direct impact on human disease prevention.
Investigation of the interaction of CoV-hosts in animals may provide further important insights into human CoV infection.
In this retrospective, we will present the current knowledge about the seven HCoVs and we will focus on the discovery process as well as the origin of animal-to-human transmission and generation-to-generation transmission.
More importantly, we compare and contrast the differences between HCoVs and the theory of the evolution of the virus as well as the recombination of its genes.
The current 2019 COVID-19 outbreak is discussed in context.
Furthermore, they emphasized the need for successful mutation and the impact of the virus evolution on the severity of the disease.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, which consists of a group of RNA viruses that are genetically positive and single-stranded.
These viruses are encoding the largest 26 to 32 genes, the lobes in the viral RNA, which are called "CoVs" because of their geometry, which resembles a knife in an electron-based gene microtube.
Structurally, CoVs have a segmentless sinusoid that is under a uniform layer.
About two-thirds of the xenome has two large, parallel chains (ORF1a and ORF1b) that are transferred to the old polypeptide enzyme pp1a and pp1ab.
The polyprotein is further processed to form 16 non-structural proteins, denoted by nsp1~16.
The remainder of the gene contains ORFs for structural proteins including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
Helper proteins of some strains are also encoded by different strains of CoVs.
Based on the differences in protein sequences, the COVs were classified into four types (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), of which beta-CoVs contain the most HCoVs and are further divided into four subtypes (A, B, C and D).
Evidence that clones humans, plants, and insects suggests that bats and rodents serve as the genetic source of the most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the dominant habitat of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have passed through the animal kingdom, and some have emerged as important pathogens for humans.
Seven HCoVs have been identified to date.
Of these, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, acute respiratory illness, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East embryosid respiratory disease (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 often cause mild symptoms such as common diarrhea and/or vomiting.
In contrast, the newly discovered SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic agents that cause severe lower respiratory tract infections in patients with high rates of progression to acute respiratory distress disorder (ARDS) and exopulmonary symptoms.
The HCoV-229E strain B814 was first isolated from the nasal effluent of patients with the common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, much knowledge has been gained through extensive studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause long-lasting symptoms.
Indeed, it is widely accepted that infection by HCoVs is generally harmless until the SARS outbreak.
The SARS outbreak that occurred in 2003 was one of the most devastating in modern history, infecting more than 8,000 people and with an overall mortality rate of over 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East respiratory disease outbreak has spread unabated across the Arabian Peninsula with a worldwide outbreak.
The 2019 (2019-nCoV) novel HCoV, renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, which killed more than 3120 people and infected more than 91,000 as of 3 March 2020.
Voices are ringing and the world needs to prepare for the impending SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs are of genotoxic origin from bats, ants or domestic pets.
The evidence supports the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats, where the virus is highly mutagenic and nonpathogenic, but demonstrates remarkable genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed serious medical, scientific, social and moral challenges for China and the world.
Tracking the genome of HCoVs provides a framework to understand the nature, dynamics, and magnitude of infection from one species to another.
This could also help guide or facilitate the search for a spread vector, intermediate vector, or storage vessel of SARS-CoV-2 with important implications in preventing future outbreaks.
In this review, we present an overview of the origin of animal-to-human transmission, species-to-species transmission, and causation of HCoVs.
In particular, we noted and discussed a topic that said that the original strain of HCoVs is not pathogenic when it lives in its original host, but it turns pathogenic after it has been transmitted to the new host.
We also reviewed the possibility of HCoV evolution where an increase in transmission can occur frequently with a decrease in pathogenicity.
The outcome of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was also discussed in this context.
CoVs in animals have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the initial isolation of HCoV-229E strain B814 from the nasal fluid of people with the common cold, different CoVs were isolated in infected animals including turkeys, ants, cows, pigs, and dogs.
Over the past decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A summary of the sequential HCoV detection process (Table 1) will provide information and guidance.
The HCoV-229E strain was first isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966 and was later adapted to grow in the WI-38 lung cell line.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E have common flu symptoms including headache, diarrhea, hives, and abdominal pain with fever and cough, which are detected in 10~20% of cases.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from tissue culture and sequenced in the brains of newborn ants.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection appear similar to those of HCoV-229E, which is characterized by no distinct symptoms from infection with other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A virus and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are globally distributed and they tend to be widely transmitted in the winter in temperate climates.
The average duration of the two viruses is less than a week, followed by about two weeks of illness.
According to a voluntary human study, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E evolved into the common cold.
Only patients with weakened immune systems exhibit severe lower respiratory tract infections.
SARS, also known as "uncommon pneumonia", was the first recorded HCoV-caused pandemic in human history, and the pathogenic biological agent was SARS-CoV, the third HCoV to be discovered.
The first case of SARS may have occurred as early as late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
As a result of the SARS outbreak, 8096 cases and 774 deaths were reported, with outbreaks spreading to many countries and continents.
In addition to the high prevalence, it is estimated that each case can cause approximately two consecutive cases over a four- to seven-day period, and the peak of the virus appears on the 10th day of infection.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experience muscle aches, headaches, fever, fatigue, and dizziness, followed by nausea and shortness of breath, which are the later symptoms.
Lymphedema, liver function decline tests, and increased creatine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
SARS patients were observed to have multiple lung tubes ruptured, rapid epithelial cell growth, and elevated blood clots.
About 20-30% of patients require continuous care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to lower respiratory infections, many organs including the stomach, liver, and intestines can also be infected in some severe cases, usually with cytokine build-ups that can be life-threatening in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated from lung scrapings of relatives of patients who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, a great effort has been made to research HCoVs.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old infant from the Netherlands during late 2004.
It was first found to be prevalent in young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The presentation of influenza, nasal coryza, eye infections, fever, and pneumonia are common in HCoV-NL63-induced diseases.
Another independent study described isolating the same virus from a nasal sample of an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it was actually distributed worldwide.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 accounts for about 4.7% of common respiratory illnesses, and its peak incidence is in early summer, autumn and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with a cough and flu-like illness known as Croup's disease.
In the same year HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and pneumonia in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and pneumonia, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with acute respiratory illness.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been found worldwide, causing a low rate of communicable disease.
All four community-acquired HCoVs have adapted well in humans and are generally less likely to cause high pathogenicity, although cases have occurred of unknown cause, such as in the rare case of the HCoV-NL63 subtype that was recently reported to cause severe gastrointestinal tract infections in China.
Generally, when these HCoVs gain the ability to transmit effectively and to maintain themselves in humans on a regular basis, they become less pathogenic or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who had developed rare pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
Of the majority of cases labelled as originating in the Middle East, imported cases were reported with a second outbreak earlier due to close contacts in countries in Europe and Tunisia.
A second outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestation of MERS is similar to SARS, characterized by a rare, progressive pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also evolved into renal insufficiency syndrome, which is unique for MERS among HCoV-caused diseases.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2500 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported, with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the deadliest viruses humans have ever encountered.
During mid-to-late December 2019, a group of pneumonia patients who had previously been in contact with SARS-CoV-2 infection was identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
The World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 low respiratory infection a public health emergency of international concern and named the disease COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, the total number of confirmed cases worldwide was 90,053, with a death rate of 3.4%.
It is noteworthy that the death rate in Hubei, China is 4.2%, while the percentage outside is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 also causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are characterized by fever, coughing, and fatigue.
They also found some patients with leukemia.
Pneumonia is one of the more serious symptoms and can quickly develop into a severe respiratory crisis.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are similar due to the similarity of the 82% high nucleotide sequence, they have branched off into different branches in the abundant gene pool.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic, but it can spread more rapidly compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
They have reported asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 and may have contributed to its rapid spread worldwide.
Comparisons and contrast between SARS-CoV-2 and the other six HCoVs groupings show similarities and differences of remarkable benefit.
First, the awakening and evolutionary durations of HCoVs are very similar.
In this sense, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general classification of the other six HCoVs.
Secondly, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is dependent on SARS-CoV and the four groups of HCoVs (e.g., HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, the SARS-CoV-2 infection has shown some characteristics similar to community-acquired infections of HCoVs, with little or no symptoms.
In other words, a small subset of severe COVID-19 cases can be seen, as in SARS-CoV infections, although with a slightly lower ratio.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 replication also reveals an interesting pattern of HCoVs and SARS-CoVs obtained from the community.
On the other hand, at least the replication capacity of SARS-CoV-2 may be as high as that of community-acquired HCoVs.
On the other hand, it is still to be re-evaluated whether there has been a decrease in SARS-CoV-2 infection after transmission to other humans, as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in a sample of the virus.
Whether saliva-to-mouth transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays a role as important as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least under certain conditions, remains to be determined by future studies.
It is also interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 can show seasonal signs similar to community-acquired HCoVs.
However, the nature of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, including its infectiousness, pathogenicity, and human-to-human transmission, will drive the COVID-19 outbreak.
All four community-acquired HCoVs that cause mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
In other respects, it may be true that humans have adapted well to all four HCoVs.
In other words, they could both have been survivors of the HCoV pandemic since ancient times.
HCoVs that cause severe human disease and human mutations to severe HCoVs are eliminated.
For all of this to happen, HCoVs must isolate themselves in the human body to have sufficient ability to assemble against the immune system.
In this sense, as the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak becomes longer and more people become infected, it will have a greater chance of adapting to humans.
If the virus adapts well, its transmission to humans will be difficult to contain, despite social distancing or other infection prevention control measures.
In recent years, the four main groups of CoVs have been present in humans with fever-like symptoms and strong immune systems.
These viruses do not need to be present in animals.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoVs are not well adapted to humans, and their transmission in the human body is not stable.
They need to preserve and breed in their genotoxic trunks and seek opportunities to spread to susceptible prey as far as possible through evolving intermediate and mature colonies.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and all four groups of HCoVs.
It spreads as quickly as community-acquired HCoVs, at least for now.
However, it is more virulent than community-acquired HCoVs and less virulent than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It is still seen to be fully integrated into humans and run inside humans without the need for a toothbrush or a midget.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoVs, it would be helpful to discuss the definitions and evolutionary characteristics of the evolutionary, biochemical, intermediate and mature HCoVs.
Animals are evolutionary analogues of HCoVs if they are closely related to a common ancestor at high levels of the blue-green sequence.
The older viruses usually adapt well and do not affect the mates.
Also, the HCoV storage site will remain for a longer period of time.
In both cases, the pathogen is usually infected and either the natural pathogen of the HCoV or its parent virus.
Conversely, if a new HCoV has appeared in the mid-range immediately before or during its exposure to humans, it cannot adapt well to the new strain and often does not cause disease.
This middle ear is the source of animal-to-human transmission and acts as a viral amplifier by allowing the viruses to differentiate themselves and then spread to humans to further spread human transmission.
HCoVs may stop transmission if the virus cannot spread beyond its host.
In contrast, HCoVs can adapt to medium-sized and even long-term outbreaks.
In this case, the middle ear becomes the natural rectum.
Data from epidemiological studies have previously indicated that SARS cases have a history of interaction with animal-related gambling.
Results from blood samples showed that animal traffickers had higher anti-SARS-CoV IgG resistance compared to the general population.
Pets and rodents sold at live animal markets were the first to be identified as containing a SARS-CoV-like virus that is almost completely identical to the SARS-CoV virus.
It is supported by the fact that no further SARS cases have been reported after killing all the animals on the market.
However, it has been reported that wild or farm-raised cattle with no exposure to the live market are highly resistant to SARS-CoV, suggesting that cattle may only act as intermediate growth vectors but not natural vectors of SARS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that because 80% of the different animals on the market in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, it is not possible to calculate the possibility that many micro-animal species could serve as primary vectors of SARS-CoV.
All of this looks like the last remaining container of SARS-CoV.
Continued search for natural strains of SARS-CoV has revealed a close association to the bat-type CoV, called SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is present in Chinese equine bats.
These bats are positive for the SARS-CoV antibody and the gene sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This virus and other mouse CoVs account for 88-92% of the similarity of nucleotide gene sequences.
These studies laid the groundwork for the new idea that bats are pathogens of humans.
They also identified several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) from bats, but only one identified WIV1 can be isolated as a live virus.
Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be a receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 extracted from bat semen samples has been shown to be used in bats, bats and humans with ACE2 receptors for cell insertion.
It is interesting that serum serum (SERA) of SARS patients is able to induce WIV1.
Thus, WIV1 represents the closest ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing a 95% nucleotide sequence axon.
Despite the strong similarities between the two viruses, it is still believed that WIV1 is not the original strain of SARS-CoV, and bats are not the intermediate host of SARS-CoV.
Biogenetic analysis groups MERS-CoV into the same groups as bat CoV-HKU4 and CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use a single receptor cell, peptidase 4 (DPP4), for viral entry.
The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence of MERS-CoV is closely related to the beta-CoVs in bats identified from Europe and Africa.
No live MERS-CoV has been detected in bats so far.
MERS-CoV and CoV-HKU25 in bats, its closest relatives, share only 87% of the blue sequence.
Therefore, bats may not be the primary host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, Middle Eastern studies have shown that camels have specific antibodies to MERS-CoVs similar to those of Middle Eastern native camels in several African countries.
A live MERS-CoV similar to the virus found in humans was isolated from a Mediterranean octopus nose sample, further suggesting that the octopus acted as a true host of MERS-CoV.
It is also noteworthy that although generally symptomatic, there has been a strong viral transmission observed in experimental camels infected with MERS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that infected bats transmit the virus not only through the respiratory tract but also through the mucous to the oral tract, which is also an important channel for transmission of the virus from bats.
However, questions remain as many confirmed MERS cases have no history of pre-symptomatic contact with bats, confirmed human-to-human transmission, or unknown transmission pathways associated with unidentified species that facilitate MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 has a 96.2% parity of the RNA with the RaTG13 CoV in bats isolated from Rhinolophus affinis.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, sequencing between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is so extensive that it is impossible to determine a causal relationship.
This suggests that bats may not be the primary host of SARS-CoV-2 unless CoVs are found in bats with nearly identical identities in the future.
The hypothesized host of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wild species sold and killed at the Hunan seafood market, where most of the early cases of COVID-19 were linked, indicating an event of animal-to-human transmission.
Several recent studies based on metagenetic sequencing have suggested that a group of small, near-extinct animals known as the wild boar (Manius guavannica) may also be a precursor to SARS-CoV-2 related ancestral beta-CoVs.
The CoV genomes in these new cohomologous animals have a similarity of 85-92% nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13, which is about 90% identifiable at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
They secrete two small strains of SARS-CoV-2 like viruses in the embryonic gene pool, one of which has a receptor cell similar to SARS-CoV-2 and 97.4% amino acid sequence.
In contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are different, although the same sequence of genomes is more highly conserved.
Recent studies conducted on infected birds have shown the presence of a viral pre-infection in lung samples that is similar to SARS-CoV-2.
The study used different assembly methods as well as particle amplification of a single part of the gene, which is about 86.3% of the virus's genome size.
We cannot count on wild animals as a continuing counterpart for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support the origin of SARS-CoV-2 from primates themselves due to sequencing between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs in primates.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is typically shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs in rodents.
They have not yet been able to establish the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, wild boars and other mammals.
While the highest sequence similarity was found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest sequence similarity of the broadest xenome sequences.
It is strongly estimated that the high degree of similarity between RBDs of SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs in cattle and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by co-evolution that is selectively correlated.
The challenging proposal is to replace the combination between SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV in cattle and RaTG13 in the third wild species.
The driving force behind the evolution of recombination is the prevalence of beta-CoVs.
The Commission has yet to reach a conclusion on the immediate genotoxic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the genotoxic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 has also been studied.
Bulk evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from CoVs in bats, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
It was reported that a bat-borne CoV called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) was found in a North American trilobite bat that showed similarity to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E has a similar gene to another bat CoV, Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was found in Ghana, and was also suspected in camels as a vector.
For clarity, current knowledge of the origin of HCoVs in animals, previously known, is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Human-animal analysis of plants has provided evidence for the animal-to-human transmission of HCoVs in history.
An outbreak of respiratory infection was recorded when HCoV-OC43 passed from animals to humans from domestic pets around 1890.
The animal-to-human transmission of HCoV-229E is not well understood.
It was found that alpha-CoVs in bats are closely related to HCoV-229E.
Among them is the alpaca alpha-CoV.
There is considerable evidence of direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, humans, not alpacas, can be attracted to bats in shared bioregions.
On the other hand, humans have close contact with alpacas.
The second bat alpha-CoVs related to HCoV-229E are mutant and non-pathogenic in bats, whereas alpaca alpha-CoV causes outbreaks of respiratory illness in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV was not detected in non-animal bodies.
Therefore, the possibility cannot be excluded that alpacas received HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoVs from humans.
In fact, bats are a direct source of viruses that infect humans, including the mad dog virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and genus virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Moreover, while alpha-CoVs in bats act as the genetic component of HCoV-229E in Alpacas and Mediterranean species, they may act as intermediates in transmitting the virus to humans, as in MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV acts as an excellent example of animal-to-human transmission from bats to dromedary camels and from dromedary camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats was known at its initial identification, and it has been expanded through subsequent discoveries.
It is clear that bats provide a rich variety of viruses for the interchange of genetic fragments and transmission from one species to another.
Longevity, large colonies, close migration and high flight capability are the prerequisites for bats to become the dominant 'virus-spreading species'.
Moreover, MERS-CoV has been transmitted to camels for decades.
It has adapted well to these camels that have changed from medium-sized to common parasitic mammals.
MERS-CoV causes severe morbidity and maintains a low rate of mutation in these animals.
Its indirect transmission to humans is random, and humans remain the last relatives of MERS-CoV whose transmission cannot be sustained.
If there is any discrepancy between the role of ducks in MERS-CoV transmission and the role of parrots in SARS-CoV-2 transmission, it is different.
In particular, wild beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in wild animals.
They may be the last straw for SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, which are similar to the monkeys in the case of SARS-CoV.
Many possibilities for animal-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 need to be controlled or eliminated in future studies.
First, bats may be the ancestral counterpart of SARS-CoV-2, which is almost identical in morphology to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share an ecological role with bats through hunting for meat or shellfish.
Second, wild animals may be part of the central pathogen where the SARS-CoV-2-related virus was first transmitted.
People transmit the virus by killing animals and eating the meat.
It is possible that many animals, including pets, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Surveys of native and wildlife for the ecosystem are guaranteed.
Third, as described above, recombination and re-infection of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in a tertiary animal species associated with bats and bats.
The search for the origin of SARS-CoV-2 in animals is ongoing.
In addition to the various types of animal parasites, three major virulence factors are also important in the adaptation of CoVs to cross the animal barrier.
First, atria are highly variable in terms of their RNA replication.
In comparison to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated rate of mutation of CoVs can be classified as "moderate" to "high" with an average replacement rate of 10 to 4 substitutions per year in one site, depending on the stage of adaptation of the CoV to the new strain.
CoVs have exoplanetary nucleus with a removal-control function, which results in hyperplasia and reduced or even reproductive capacity.
Interestingly, the nucleotide of Remdesivir is known to inhibit the self-replication of CoVs by inhibiting the enzyme exoribonuclease and the enzyme RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most successful anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
However, the rate of morphogenesis of these virulence-causingCoVs is millions of times higher than that of their co-morphogenesis.
Moreover, the rate of mutation is often high when CoVs are not well adapted to the pathogen.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high rate of mutation, the rate of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 is substantially lower, indicating a high degree of adaptation to humans.
It is said to be adapted to other counterparts that are close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this point also applies to MERS-CoVs that have adapted well to a virus.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that genetic engineering will produce a rapidly effective SAES-CoV-2 vaccine and antiviral.
Second, the large RNA xenome in these CoVs is highly adaptive, which is instrumental in differentiation and replication.
It is supported by a fully differentiated open reading frame and a protein function encoded toward the final third of the genome.
Third, CoVs change patterns randomly and frequently during RNA fragmentation through a different replication pathway.
In mice that serve as synapses, threading occurs frequently during CoV RNA transcription.
Full-length similarity and sub-symptom RNAs can combine to form a new CoV.
Evidence of evolutionary recombination was found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 as well as animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Viral and viral interactions are linked to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors identified above, viral interaction with host receptor cells is another important factor influencing animal-to-human transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is accepted as a normal example, which also demonstrates evidence of positive selection during animal-to-human transmission events.
Based on comparative analysis between human and mammalian isolates of SARS-CoVs, SARS-CoV is thought to undergo rapid adaptation in different host species, particularly with changes in the RBD of the S protein.
Generally, RBD in the S protein of the CoV interacts with the cell receptor and is selective in response to human immunity.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is located at 318 to 510 amino acids on the S1 subunit that binds to human ACE2 as well as its coreceptors for viral entry.
The RBD of SARS-CoV is capable of recognizing ACE2 receptor cells of various animals including dogs, mice, rats, rats and dogs that allow the virus to be transmitted.
In fact, only six amino acid residues have been observed separately from human and civet viruses in RBD, and all four are located in the receptor cell-linked receptor for interaction with the ACE2 receptor cell.
SARS-CoV in mammals has mutations of the genes K479N and S487T in its RBD, which may increase the likelihood of interaction of large-species proteins with human ACE2 receptors.
Speaking of which, these two amino acid substitutions could be important in transmitting the virus to humans.
It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 has the same receptor as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 isoform of the S protein suggests that the affinity of its S protein to humans with ACE2 may have been altered.
In fact, cryo-EM studies have shown a 10 to 20 times higher correlation of this association than between humans with ACE2 and the SARS-CoV S protein.
It is also interesting to determine whether other receptor cells may be targeted for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but with a different part of S.
There are neurotransmitters for the reception of other HCoVs, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of CoVs in humans following animal-to-human transmission from their animal ancestors.
In addition to neurons for cell reception, the outcome of animal-to-human transmission of HCoVs is also governed by the dependence of other hosts and other limiting factors.
Differences in host proteins between humans and the natural hosts of HCoVs such as bats, dromedary bats and beetles may be a barrier to transmission between species.
HCoVs must capture host dependence and modify host binding factors for successful cross-transmission.
In this sense, the molecular determinants in the main part of the virus's interaction remain to be identified and characterized.
A non-specific genome-wide screening of the pathogenicity and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using the state-of-the-art technology of CRISPR could be fruitful.
Emergence of new HCoVs: Back to zero
The accumulation of CoVs in bats provides a wide opportunity for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs act as the genetic organ of HCoVs.
Furthermore, rapid mutation and replication of genes also promote HCoV evolution and play two important roles in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of a gene that encodes a new protein has the potential to dramatically modify the protein's genes.
ORF8 of the various proteins of SARS-CoV has been identified as important in human adaptation similar to the SARS-CoV virus isolated from bats, but has been found to have differentiated ORF8 proteins.
They found the 29-nucleotide-deleting characteristics of SARS-CoVs in strains that were isolated at the start of the human epidemic.
This deletion differentiates ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, which are understood to be self-transforming, inducing translocation of the carrier.
In addition, SARS-CoVs interact with alpha- and gamma-linear co-infections, where a large number of small reservoir regions are identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
The recombination site is also identified in nsp9, most of nsp10, and various parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the spread of MERS-CoV has experienced a cross-line reassortment event that occurred in dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, re-infection events have also been observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs combine with other animal CoVs in unstructured genes.
Selective breeding should be done with caution as it can lead to accidental mutations of the virus's genes, which can be caused by viral degradation through selective stress such as the immune system of the breed.
An example of these effects is the complete loss of ORF4 in the HCoV-229E line offspring caused by the deletion of two nucleotides.
While complete ORF4 can be observed in HCoV-229E-associated viruses in bats and bats, alpaca alpha-CoV exhibits a single nucleotide insertion that causes a morphological change.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by their intracellular pressure selection.
An uncertain or diffuse symptom is detected when bats are infected with CoVs, indicating a similarity between CoVs and bats.
It showed that bats were well adapted to the physiology and pathogenology of CoVs.
For example, differences in the activation of the anti-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathogenesis caused by CoVs.
In addition, natural killer cell activity in bats is suppressed due to the increased cellular response of receptor cells to the stimuli of natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and the low level of resistance of the homologous first class molecules of the homologous differential.
In addition, high reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from the high metabolic activity of bats can inhibit CoV transmission and affect exoribonuclease detection, thus providing a selective pressure for the formation of high pathogenic viruses when entering new tissues.
Many other pathogens of the CoV group can also evolve by recombination, resulting in new proteins or proteins that are characterized by their homologous binding.
So it is no coincidence that three groups of HCoVs have emerged over the past two decades.
CoVs are not pathogens or they simply cause symptoms in mammals such as bats and bats.
They reproduce vigorously without triggering a strong maternal immune response.
Here are the secrets of detecting asymptomatic agents and the cause of severe human infections.
Most severe symptoms are caused by a decrease in the immune system and the number of cytokines, whereby an increased immune response leads to more severe lung damage.
On the other hand, if you are infected but have no symptoms, it means that the immune system has not yet been activated in relation to the spread of the coronavirus.
The same strategy in disrupting the immune system response may be effective in treating SARS-CoV-2.
The anti-pheromone response is particularly strong in bats.
Therefore, the use of type I interferon-expressing proteins at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
Furthermore, activation of NLRP3 inflammation in mice was not successful.
For this reason, inhibiting NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 is in the same general range as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Beta-CoV shares 95% of the same nucleotides as SARS-CoV that we found. Similarly, Beta-CoV also shares 96% of the same nucleotides as SARS-CoV-2.
Pets and other animals on the market have been found to have the same viral sequence as SARS-CoV, but the direct intermediate for SARS-CoV-2 has not been identified.
Beta-CoVs in bats were found to be highly similar to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that bats could act as one of several carriers or that Beta-CoVs could help provide genetic input to the next generation of SARS-CoV-2.
Although there is still some uncertainty, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was created by human error or by chance.
CoVs have returned to normal due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Studies of CoVs in bats and other animals have dramatically changed our understanding of the importance of animal-to-human origin and HCoVs storage sites in human transmission.
Widespread evidence suggests that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and were transmitted to humans via the central nervous system.
As the SARS-CoV infection originated from contact between humans and civet (cheese-like) animals in markets, the closure of markets selling meat and raw materials and the killing of civet animals should have effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, poultry should be withdrawn from the market in wet conditions to prevent zoonotic (animal-to-human) transmission due to the observation of multiple transgenic populations of the same species where poultry beta-CoVs are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, how and whether SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted to humans through wildlife and other animal species remains to be determined in future investigations.
In addition, MERS-CoV has been present in dromedary camels for a long time.
These camels play an important role for transportation as well as an important source of meat, milk, leather products and wool for the local population.
They are widespread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore not possible to kill all camels to control MERS, as has been done in wildlife markets in China to contain the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the recurrence of MERS outbreaks, a methodology should be developed to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV for camels in conjunction with other infectious disease control measures.
Since we can't eliminate these viruses, new genotypes can emerge, causing an outbreak.
Many types of animal-to-human CoVs are roaming the forest.
In particular, the CoVs in bats that can be transmitted from animals to humans are different.
There is a high chance that these CoVs may evolve or reappear, causing new CoVs that could cause future transmission and death.
China should abandon the cannibalistic culture in some parts of the country to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
Better preparedness and response planning should be in place with the painful experience of SARS, MERS and COVID-19.
In fact, many viruses have been on the planet for a long time.
They stay in their normal state until they have a chance to fake a replication.
Although bats have many characteristics that contribute to the spread of the virus, people can minimise the chance of contact with bats and other wildlife species if they are educated to stay away from them.
Continuous monitoring of animal host is necessary for a better understanding of the ecosystem of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will reveal benefits in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
In summary, the most effective way to prevent animal infections is to keep people away from ecosystems where germs can infect humans.
Several fragments in the genome of the SARS-CoV-2 genome have not yet been found.
First, if bats transmit the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to bats, it is interesting to see under what conditions bats and bats can be similar to the ecological model.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in transmitting to humans, they should monitor how humans interact with bats.
Third, if the third animal host acts as a middle master, it must specify how it interacts with various animal species, including humans, bats, and wildlife.
Finally, some animals, including pets, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and both surveillance and experimental infection should be undertaken.
If it is a bat, a bird, or another animal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its almost identical parent virus will be identified in its normal range in the future.
Further investigation in this area will help to reveal how SARS-CoV-2 evolves in animals, which is significantly related to the prevention and management of COVID-19 in humans.
Updating the COVID-19 diagnosis, suspected cases and infection is necessary
On 6 February 2020, our Task Force published the Rapid Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of the 2019 novel coronavirus infection (2019-nCoV), and this guideline provides our experience and a reference document for the fight against the pandemic worldwide.
But coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our understanding and knowledge is constantly increasing based on the results of ongoing research and practical application experience. Therefore, the strategies of diagnosis and treatment are also constantly being updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guidelines and provided the latest diagnostic characteristics of "suspect" and "infection" cases according to the latest Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (Seventh Edition) issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, which is now officially named as the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and the virus was named as the severe respiratory illness coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, our team quickly developed guidelines and were published online in Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
It has attracted a lot of attention since its release.
However, please note that COVID-19 is a new disease, our understanding and knowledge is constantly increasing based on ongoing research results and clinical practice, so diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the Guidelines on Diagnosis and Treatment for COVID-19 Disease issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (January 16, 2020 to March 3, 2020) issued a total of seven publications, some of which were substantially modified.
Now our guidelines have been argued by Zhou et al. They suggest a simple score based on their clinical experience.
Their work has added new evidence to our guidelines and is a valuable long-term document for the global pandemic.
We support their important work and thank them.
But their work also needs to be updated in line with the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh trial version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspected case, one of the elements of the epidemiological characteristics of the disease must be combined with two elements of the symptomatic manifestation, in order to perform a comprehensive analysis, or the requirement to meet three symptoms, if the epidemiological history is not clear:
Epidemic history: (1) History of travel or residence in Wuhan and surrounding areas or other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported in the last 14 days before symptoms occurred; (2) History of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infection cases (with positive nucleic acid testing); (3) History of contact with fever patients or with symptoms of withdrawal from Wuhan and surrounding areas or other communities with reported COVID-19 infection in the last 14 days before symptoms occurred; (4) History of kidney contact of cases (≥ 2 cases of fever and/or infection occurred within 2 weeks, such as in a small office area).
Clinical symptoms: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with a characteristic picture of COVID-19 infection; (3) total blood cell counts showing normal decline or decreased lymphatic count in the early stages of onset.
Diagnosis of infection should be based on suspected cases with any pathogenic material or evidence of the following: (1) timely PCR test positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus (2) whole-virus sequence showing high similarity to known coronaviruses (3) positive for specific IgM antigen and specific IgG antigen to SARS-CoV-2 virus in serum testing or positive to negative change of specific IgG of SARS-CoV-2 virus or increased IgG 4≥ during the recovery phase, which is in the early stages of treatment.
We can see that the polymerase chain reaction test for nucleic acid in urine or blood samples was included in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
Pathogen detection of blood samples was included in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions, and subsequently blood analysis evidence was included in the seventh edition.
These changes depend on researchers continuing to work to find the best nucleic acid detector for rapid diagnosis as well as samples from the respiratory tract, including blood samples, which increase the availability of different samples and help bring positive antibody results into the diagnostic profile.
In addition, there is much evidence to warn us to be cautious with patients who have unusual and asymptomatic symptoms.
Therefore, the flow table of Zhou et al. should be updated because they classify people without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
Scoring systems also need to be integrated into more practice and clinical studies.
To conclude, we hope more firsthand evidence will come along and invite readers to provide their feedback.
For the diagnosis of "suspicious cases" and "infectious cases", we recommend that they follow and abide by the latest guidelines of their home country.
Our staff will update our guidance in a timely manner to provide assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest daily rate
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 that day.
This is the highest number of deaths per day from the virus.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemic Control and Research (IEDCR) reported a total of 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases at home.
They recorded a total of 17 deaths.
Through an online news briefing, IEDCR director Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora said the dead included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, there were two cases over 60 years old, two between 51 and 60 years old and one between 41-50 years old.
She also said that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic.
Hospital officials told Anadolu Agency, a local media outlet, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, the chairman of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at Kuwait's Mystery Hospital.
In a video statement online on Saturday, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges Obaidul Quader said public transport would be closed for longer than planned until next Saturday.
The public travel closure initially began on March 26 and is scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of essential goods such as medical supplies, fuel and food is still allowed.
An initial record on 8 March showed that two cases of Covid-19 in Bangladesh had returned from Italy, one of whom was a woman, the wife of a man who had also contracted the virus.
All three were recovered as of March 19.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected over a million people worldwide
According to Johns Hopkins University data on Thursday, the number of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections has surpassed one million worldwide.
At least 52 thousand people have died in connection with COVID-19 caused by the coronavirus.
A major development occurred on the same day Malawi confirmed its first virus infection and Zimbabwe had its first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea claimed on Thursday that it is one of the few countries that still has no coronavirus infections.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, with 79,332 cases in the four hours prior to 10am Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 coronavirus cases have been recorded, with at least 5,900 deaths related to the disease.
CBS reported, citing Johns Hopkins University data, that more than 1,000 people died on Wednesday from coronavirus infections.
Around the world, many countries have announced strict measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow's governor Sergei Sobyanin extended the city's lockdown until May 1.
Nationwide, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russians will be paid without having to go to work until April 30.
Portugal voted to extend the state of emergency by 15 days, with 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one abstention.
Saudi Arabia has extended a curfew on the main streets of Mecca and Medina, which lasts all day, previously effective between 3 pm and 6 am.
Thailand plans to implement a curfew between 10pm and 4am.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state has extended the stay-at-home order until May 1.
Stores in Australia have low paper usage per operation
On Sunday and Saturday evenings, Australian retailers Woolworths and Coles reduced their purchases of cardboard to two and one pack per transaction in all stores nationwide.
On Monday, the ALDI marketplace also recommended a one-pack limit.
These deadlines are posted as messages on the checklist and on the Facebook page.
Customers are reportedly buying the stash out of fear of COVID-19 in case they need to stay in isolation.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of bag paper for home delivery to one pack per order.
These changes were made in accordance with the four-tier limitation measures on initial purchases introduced by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 November, respectively.
"In its March 8 media release, Coles Modern Market reported that with the four-package limitation, ""many stores were sold out within an hour of delivery"" and called the demand "unprecedented", while ALDI Market called it "unexpected" in a Facebook post on Tuesday".
According to a spokesperson for Woolworths, sales have "increased significantly" in the past week.
Costco's Canberra store also set the allowable number of packages to two last week.
To reduce the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and to speed up shipments, Woolworths ordered additional stock, while ALDI created stock for projects planned for specialty batteries ahead of time.
Russell Zimmerman, president of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers were trying to bring the trucks into stock, but the council's local restrictions on truck entries were making it difficult.
He expects the initial cost of production to rise as suppliers try to meet demand and have less specialized skills.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the initial store release, some stores will not be able to run Wednesday specials.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert from the University of Technology in Finland, said these stores fill up every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a two-piece item that leads to a limited stock volume, and when sold out, leaving room for large containers leaves a feeling of scarcity.
Russell Zimmerman told ABC News that "Colos and Volt have the view [that] if there are a lot of items on the wall, if products like toilet paper and detergent can be bought and in quantity, you might be able to reduce the fear a lot".
Who Gives a Crap, a company that makes recycled paper bags, said Wednesday that it was out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex Toilet Tissue and Solaris paper and makes toiletries, said it was working 24/7 to maintain the supply, according to a report by News.com.au.
Real estate website Domain.com reported that a real estate seller gave away free toilet paper to the first bidders at a Melbourne auction when two or three bids were made because buyers were off on Labor Day weekend.
The NT News edition of Thursday's edition, published daily in Darwin, included eight pages of entries meant to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Initially, the stores were hesitant to impose the restrictions, according to a report from ABC Australia on March 3, as they said they had no plans to introduce restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including face masks, toiletries, dryers, hand dryers and mushrooms.
Similarly, on Sunday afternoon outside Australia, the UK online marketplace Ocado was seen to be restricting paper purchases for Andres bottles to up to 12 packages.
The World Health Organization has declared the COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced an outbreak of COVID-19 caused by a virus caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Although the term "pandemic" refers to how the disease has spread and not just to specific cases of such a serious disease, the World Health Organization has noted the need to urge governments to take action:
All countries can still change the course of the pandemic.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, said that if countries find out about the testing of vaccines, isolate them and mobilize their populations in response.
 We are deeply concerned both by the level of emergency declaration, the extent and severity of the emergency and the level of emergency of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the spread of the pandemic is "unprecedented".
In his speech published by CNN in February, he said that "apart from influenza, no other respiratory virus has been tracked from emergence until there is a continued global spread".
Ghebreyesus expressed similar sentiments, saying, "We have never seen a pandemic caused by the coronavirus before".
"And we have never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time", he continued.
The new pandemic, which follows the WHO decision in January to declare the spread of the disease a public health emergency, is of international concern.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak that "it will get worse".
As of Thursday, the news agency reported at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus outbreak is a continuation of the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, declared a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, cases of COVID-19 were approximately 1.61 million reported from 210 countries and regions, with approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people were cured.
The case mortality rate is estimated at 4% in China, while for the rest of the world it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
The complications can include pneumonia and severe respiratory symptoms.
From contact with the patient to the onset of symptoms, it is usually detectable within five days, but can be detected between two and fourteen days.
There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The first phase of treatment is symptom- and supportive-based treatment.The recommended preventive measures include washing hands, mouthwashing when coughing, keeping distance from others, and monitoring and isolating those who suspect they are infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, bans, workplace hazard screening and lockdowns.
The pandemic has caused global economic, social, political, cultural and religious events to be postponed or cancelled, and panic, supply shortages, and fear-based shopping.
Schools and universities closed nationwide or regionally in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the global student population.
Fake news about the virus has spread online, and it has also caused phenomena of xenophobia and prejudice against Chinese, other East Asian and Southeast Asian natives, and similar-looking people and others from areas where the cases have been reported.
By reducing travel and closing heavy industries, the result is a reduction in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province) reported a cluster case of pneumonia of unknown cause on December 31, 2019, and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
The cases mostly involve Hunan seafood markets, and the virus is therefore thought to be of Huno origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to the bat coronavirus, the wild boar coronavirus, and the SARS-CoV. The first infected individual was later found to have fallen ill on 1 December 2019, and the individual was not in direct contact with the group of viruses found in the raw materials market.
In the first cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds of the cases were found to be of market origin.
On 13 March 2020, an unconfirmed report from the South China Morning Post suggested that a case occurred on 17 November 2019, a 55-year-old from Hubei Province, possibly the first case.On 26 February 2020, the World Health Organization reported that recent cases were reported to have declined in China, but immediately there was an increase in Italy, Iran and South Korea, with new cases outside China surpassing the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be no reported cases, especially among those with mild symptoms.
As of 26 February, some cases were reported among young people aged 19 and under, 2.4% of cases worldwide.The UK's Science Adviser Patrick Vallance estimated that 60% of the UK population would be infected before effective collective immunity was achieved.
Cases refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose tests have been confirmed to be positive, according to the official ceremony.
As of March 23, no country had tested 3 percent of its population, and several countries had issued official policies not to test those with mild symptoms, including Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Sweden.
A study published on 16 March found that in China, as of 23 January, approximately 86% of COVID-19 infections were undetected, and these unrecorded infections were the source of transmission for 79% of recorded cases.
Statistical analysis released on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was higher than the number of reported cases.
The initial estimate of the baseline gene sequence number (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has suggested that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 have recovered.
For countries without a time of progression, the time of progression from symptom to death is between 6 and 41 days, with the most common time being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, there were approximately 97,000 deaths due to COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, about 80% of the deaths were over 60 years of age, and 75% had cardiovascular disease and stroke.The official death toll from the COVID-19 pandemic generally refers to those who died testing positive for COVID, according to official data.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 may be higher because it does not count people who died without testing - e.g., at home in a care facility.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the total number of deaths covered by official services by a factor of 4-5x.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) informant acknowledged that "we know [the death toll] is a staggering one", a statement confirmed by reports of uncounted deaths in the United States.Such staggering is common when there are epidemics, such as the H1N1 pandemic in 2009.The first death was in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14.
As of 28 February, outside mainland China, multiple deaths have been recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica.
These numbers vary by region and time and are influenced by the size of the diagnosis, the quality of the healthcare system, the time since the initial outbreak and demographic characteristics such as age, gender and overall health.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global mortality ratio was 6.0% (97,039/1617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The numbers vary by region.
In China, estimates of the mortality ratio have decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms beginning on January 1st, 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms beginning after February 1st, 2020).Other measures include case-death rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of those diagnosed who die from the disease, and infection mortality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from the disease.
These statistics do not timeline and track specific populations from infection through case resolution.
Some studies have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Oxford University Evidence-Based Medicine Centre estimated the infection mortality rate for the entire pandemic to be between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The above-list estimates are consistent with the results of the first randomized test for COVID-19 in Germany and the study is evaluating the impact of the test on the CFR estimates.
WHO claims the pandemic is manageable.
The peak and end times of the outbreaks are unclear and may vary by location.
Maciej Boni at Penn State University states that with the remainder of the general lack of control, outbreaks rise, then begin to decline once the disease is gone.
But it's almost impossible to make a reasonable prediction now about when it's going to happen.
The Chinese government's senior medical adviser, Zhong Nanshan, claimed that "it could be over by June" if all countries can be united to follow the World Health Organization's advice on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
"On March 17, Adam Kucharski from the School of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene suggested that SARS-CoV-2 ""may continue to spread within one or two years"".
"According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical isolation and other measures will be necessary ""until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or longer) """.
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it's probably impossible that this coronavirus, because it's already ready for transmission, will not go away completely, and it will evolve into a seasonal disease, which could come back every year".
The severity of a possible re-emergence will depend on the immunity of populations and the magnitude of the variation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 may be associated with uncertainty, and an infected individual may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms were fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Rare symptoms include fatigue, phlegm, loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, dry throat, headache, nausea, vomiting, hemorrhoids, or discoloration of the skin.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists symptoms as shortness of breath, persistent chest pain or sudden confused pressure, difficulty waking and facial or oral swelling.
Some infected people may be asymptomatic but have test results that confirm infection, so researchers have advised that those who have been in close contact with an infected person should be screened and monitored closely to prevent infection.
China's estimate of the ratio of non-disclosure is low at 44%.
The normal wake-up period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) ranges from one day to 14 days, a general period of five days.For example, the uncertainty estimate is that the percentage of people with COVID-19 who initially lose their sense of smell is 30% and later drops to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still unclear.
The disease is believed to be spread primarily during intimate contact and by small droplets produced during coughing, sneezing or talking, with close contact being between 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 ft).
Studies have found that uncontrolled coughing can cause saliva to leak 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have suggested that the virus can also be transmitted by small droplets that remain in the environment for long periods of time, which may be generated during speech.
The saliva may fall into the mouth or nose of nearby people or be absorbed into the lungs by inhalation.
Certain medical procedures such as intracranial blood transfusion and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause respiratory distress that removes mucus and can cause airway transmission.
It can also be spread when a person touches a foreign surface, including the skin, and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
While there are concerns that it could spread by mosquitoes, the risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of direct transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.The virus is most contagious in the first three days after symptom onset, although transmission can occur before symptoms appear and in the later stages of the disease.
People tested positive for the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms, suggesting that transmission is possible before significant symptoms develop.
There have been only a few reports of asymptomatic cases that have been laboratory confirmed, but mass referrals have been determined by some countries during follow-up investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) stated that while it is not yet fully clear how the disease is spread, one person can transmit it to two to three people.
The virus has been found to survive on polypropylene for three days and 304 hours on stainless steel, one day on cardboard and up to four days on a tray.
However, this varies depending on taste and temperature.Cattle and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although UK authorities recommend washing their hands after contact with animals, as well as after other outdoor contact with infected humans.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a previously unknown virus, first isolated in three people with pneumonia associated with severe respiratory syndrome cases in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are present in viruses related to the coronavirus in nature.Outside the human body, the virus will be eliminated by household soap that can break down its defences.SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV.
The disease is thought to be caused by animal infection.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronavirus is genetically related to betacoronavirus strains in the B strain, along with strains derived from two bats.
It is 96 percent similar at the genetic level to other bat coronavirus variants (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only a single amino acid difference in specific parts of the gene between the virus from wild animals and the gene from humans.
A complete comparison of genes found that almost 92% of the genetic material shared between the wild boar and SARS-CoV-2 was insufficient to confirm that the wild boar was a moderate host.
A viral infection can be provisionally diagnosed based on the initial symptoms, although final confirmation must be made by positive polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of the transcribed material or CT scan.
A comparative study of polymerase chain reaction to Citrate in Wuhan showed that Citrate is more reactive than polymerase chain reaction, with many of its features overlapping with pneumonia and other pathological processes, although not specific.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that CT scans should not be used to screen for or as a first-line test for COVID-19.
The World Health Organization released a multi-serum RNA test for SARS-CoV-2 with the first release on 17 January.
Testing using rRT-PCR.
Testing can be done on a respiratory or blood sample.
Results are usually within a few hours to a day.
Generally, the test is performed on nasal swabs, although nasal swabs can also be used.A number of laboratories and companies are developing a fluid test that detects the organism.
As of 6 April 2020, these documents have not been proven accurate enough to be approved for general use.
In the United States, silicone-based fluid tests are only approved for emergency use by certified laboratories.
Features of imaging on X-rays and computed tomography (CT) on people with symptoms include a mirror on the ground and an unlit echo chamber.
The Italian Radiological Society is collecting international online data on visual detection for confirmed cases.
Due to the similarity to other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without PCR confirmation is specific in determining the diagnosis of COVID-19.
A large study in China compared CT chest test results with PCR and pointed out that although the images are less specific for transmission, they are faster and more responsive, suggesting that its tests are a screening tool in epidemic areas.
A neural network based on the resolution of the artificial brain has been developed to capture images of the virus with both X-ray and CT scans.
Strategies for preventing transmission include maintaining good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth without washing hands, and coughing or sneezing, using a mouthwash, and immediately throwing the mouthwash in the garbage can.
Those who may already be infected are advised to wear a surgical mask in public.
Quarantine measures have also been introduced to prevent transmission.Many governments have imposed restrictions or bans on non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached a stage of community spread in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading in the community and some community members are unaware of where and how they are infected.Health care providers who are caring for someone who may be infected with the virus are advised to use standard precautions, contact and eye protection.Contact tracking is an important method for health authorities to identify the source of infection and to prevent further transmission.
The government's use of mobile phone location data for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement calling for limits on this type of surveillance.
Various mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, several expert groups are working on privacy solutions such as using Bluetooth to locate nearby users.
Users will receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.Misinformation is being spread about how to prevent infection.For example, washing the nose and mouth with contaminated mouthwash is not effective.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, although several organizations are working on it.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least two minutes, especially after bathing or when the hands can be seen to be soiled, before eating, and after urinating, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by a family of soaps that blast its immune system.
The CDC further recommends using handwashing with a minimum alcohol content of 60% when soap and water are not readily available.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The surface can be disinfected with a few sprays (within one minute after applying a disinfectant to the stainless steel surface) including 62% ethanol, 71% isopropanol, 50% 100% sodium iopophorite, 0.1% hydrogen peroxide, 0.5% and 0.2% iodine.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chrohexidine gluconate are less effective.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that if a suspected or confirmed case of COVID is found in an office or daycare facility, such as a bathroom, a shared electronic device, such as a tablet, touchscreen, touchscreen, touchpad, keyboard, and ATM, the patient should be disinfected.
WHO recommends that people cough and sneeze with a handkerchief or use a mouthwash when coughing or sneezing and immediately throw away the paper.
Medical masks are recommended for people who may be infected, as wearing masks can reduce the number of infections and eliminate fluid when talking, coughing and sneezing.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidance on when and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, wearing masks can reduce people's exposure to their faces, which is a major source of infection without proper hand sanitization. Masks are also recommended for caregivers of those who may be infected.
The World Health Organization has recommended that healthy people wear masks in high-risk situations, such as caregivers of COVID-19 patients.However, they also recognize that wearing masks can help people avoid their own facial exposure.
Some countries have begun to encourage the use of face masks by members of the public.
In the United States, the CDC recommends masks made from non-medical masks.China specifically recommends that the public, especially those in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or more) with others, use disposable medical masks.
Hong Kong recommends masks when people travel on public transport or when in crowded locations.
Thai health officials are encouraging people to make masks from masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia ban going out in public without masks or nose and mouth masks.
On March 16, Vietnam suggested that you wear a face mask when going out in public to protect yourself and others.
The Austrian government has ordered that everyone entering shops must wear a face mask.
Israel has recommended that all citizens wear masks when in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing tens of millions of masks a day since mid-March, requires passengers on trains and buses to wear masks by April 1.
Panama has required the wearing of masks whenever outdoors and has also recommended the manufacture of handmade masks for those who cannot afford to buy them.
Masks are widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as social distancing) includes transmission control measures aimed at slowing the spread of disease by reducing close contact between people.
The measures include quarantines, restrictions on travel and closure of schools, workplaces, sports stadiums, factories or shopping malls, etc.
Individuals can practice social distancing by staying home, limiting travel, avoiding public places, using non-contact socialising and isolating themselves from others.
Many governments are now defining or recommending social distancing in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum gathering size recommended by government agencies and U.S. health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 (if there was no spread of COVID-19 in the region) to 50 and later to 10.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of two or more people.Adults and those with conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and a weakened immune system face a high risk of serious illness and a range of consequences.In late March 2020, the World Health Organization and other health organizations began to replace the term "social isolation" with "physical isolation" to emphasise that the goal is to reduce the likelihood of physical contact while maintaining close or distant social contact.
The use of the term "social distancing" has led to the effect that people should be in a state of complete social isolation rather than encouraged to stay in touch with others through other means.
These include recommendations to only have sex with those you live with who do not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of infection.
The Health Agency has issued detailed guidelines for proper quarantine.Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for all people living in areas affected by the outbreak.
Self-isolation recommendations are announced for those in high-risk groups.
Those who may have been in contact with a COVID-19 patient and those who have recently traveled to a country or region with a high prevalence of infection are advised to self-isolate for 14 days from the time of last exposure.
The strategy in controlling the outbreak is to manage the situation, contain it and reduce its severity.
This is done in the early stages of the outbreak and is intended to monitor and isolate those infected, as well as to introduce other measures of control, transmission and vaccination to stop the disease from spreading to the general population.
When the spread of the disease cannot be contained, the next effort is to reach the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and reduce its impact on health care systems and society.
A combination of both control and mitigation measures may be implemented simultaneously.
Containment requires stronger measures to prevent outbreaks by reducing the number of re-infections to less than 1 percent of controlled, the spread of infectious diseases is trying to slow the maximum rate of spread known as the iron curtain of outbreaks.
This reduces the risk of healthcare being in trouble and provides more time for vaccine development and treatment.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that could control the outbreak include self-prevention measures such as hand sanitization, face masks and quarantine, community measures aimed at keeping the hungry away from the body, such as closing schools and cancelling large gatherings.Community involvement to promote acceptance and participation in such interventions.Many measures aimed at containing the outbreak of the disease have been taken in China as the severity of the outbreak has emerged, such as citywide curfews and strict travel bans.
Other countries have also adopted various measures aimed at curbing the spread of the virus.
South Korea has implemented widespread surveillance and imposed quarantine on a base basis and issued a travel advisory for infected individuals.
Singapore has provided financial support for those infected and quarantined and imposed heavy fines on those who did not comply.
Taiwan has increased the production of face masks and imposed penalties on medical stockpiling.Reports for the UK and US indicate that mitigation (slowing but not stopping the spread of disease) and containment (slowing the spread of disease) are major challenges.
The best mitigation policies can cut peak health care needs by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still cause hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems are suffering.
Action restrictions may be optional and necessary as long as the virus is spreading to humans (or until a vaccine is available, if available earlier) when transmission is rapidly rebounding as measures are relaxed.
Long-term interventions to contain the pandemic have caused social and economic losses.
No specific antiviral has been approved for use for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing of existing drugs.
Excessive use of refrigerants, drinking water, and rest can help alleviate symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid injection, and respiratory assistance may be necessary.
Steroid use can worsen the outcome.
Several ingredients previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also states that some traditional and home remedies may provide relief from symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Capacity building and adaptation of health care for the COVID-19 patient population has been described by the World Health Organization as a primary response to the outbreak.
ECDC and WHO in Europe announced a shift for hospitals and primary healthcare services to a multi-pronged resource shift, calling for a focus on testing services for COVID-19, cancelling the process, selecting early, isolating and isolating COVID-19 patients, and enhancing the capacity for high-sensitivity care by training staff and increasing the number of ventilators and beds.
There are various theories about where the first case (called patient zero) may have originated.
The first known case of the new and isolated virus may have occurred on December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
In a month, the number of cases of Zika virus in Hubei has been steadily increasing.
Most of these cases were associated with the Huanan seafood market, which also sold live animals, and one source suggested that the virus originated from a species of shark in these animals, or could be said, in other words, that it originated from animals.The pneumonia patch of unknown origin was detected on December 26 and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who reported it to the Wuhan Disease Control and Prevention Center on December 27.
On December 30, doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital informed their colleagues about SARs, similar to coronavirus.
Eight doctors, including Li Wenliang, were alerted by police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was charged with disorderly conduct.
The Wuhan Health Commission later issued a public notice on December 31 and notified the World Health Organization.
Sufficient cases of unprecedented pneumonia were reported to health authorities in Wuhan to establish an investigation in early January.During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled in about seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces in China, caused by Chinese New Year migration, and Wuhan is a major transportation and rail hub.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases per day, including two in Beijing and one in Xinjiang.
Official data later showed 6,174 people had developed symptoms as of January 20, 2020.As of March 26, the United States had overtaken China and Italy as the countries with the highest number of infections in the world.As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases had been reported worldwide, more than 97,000 people had died, and more than 364,000 people had recovered.

The tourism sector suffered the worst among other sectors due to travel bans, closures of public places including tourist attractions, and government advisories against travel worldwide.
As a result, many airlines have cancelled flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while British regional airline Flybe has fallen into disrepair.
The impact on the cruise industry is at an unprecedented level.
Several railway stations and ports were also closed.
The outbreak coincided with the June Festival, a major travel season associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
Many crowd-related events have been cancelled by national and local governments, including New Year's Eve celebrations, with private companies also closing their shops and tourist attractions, such as Disneyland in Hong Kong and in Shanghai.
Many New Year's Eve events and tourist attractions were closed to prevent large-scale gatherings, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and various traditional festivals.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces and municipalities, authorities extended the New Year's holiday break to February 10, advising most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions represent 80% of the country's gross domestic product and 90% of exports.

Market operators around the world have implemented additional measures such as increased sanitation, installation of temperature scanners to check the temperature of shoppers, and cancellation of events.According to estimates by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the crisis caused by the spread of the pandemic could be between 14 and 22 million people, more in extreme poverty in Latin America than in the situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China's rural migrant workers, numbering nearly 300 million, are either confined to their homes in mainland China or trapped in Hubei province.As of March 2020, more than 10 million Americans had lost their jobs and had applied for government assistance.
The coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million jobs in the United States, and the unemployment rate could rise to 32%, according to forecasts by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.The lockdown in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers out of work (where they receive daily allowances).A survey by the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian households have experienced unemployment.
During mid-March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits, and 1 million UK workers applied for a universal credit scheme.
Germany's short-term labour contract was approved by France and Britain.
The arts and cultural sectors have been severely impacted by the pandemic, affecting the functioning of institutions as well as individuals, both work and independence worldwide.
Arts and cultural organizations have tried to further their mission (often publicly funded) to provide access to cultural resources to the community, protect the safety of their staff and the public, and support artists wherever possible.
By March 2020, worldwide and at all levels, museums, libraries, theatres and other cultural institutions were completely shut down, with their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or delayed.
The recent decline of the disease has been accelerated and accelerated by the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and social events such as concerts and concerts, technology conferences and car shows.
The film industry has also suffered a setback. The Vatican has announced that the Holy Week celebration in Rome, which takes place during the last week of the Christian holiday season, has been cancelled.
The bishop-controlled areas in many Christian churches have recommended that elderly Christians stay at home instead of meeting on Sundays. Some churches offer services via radio, live streaming on the Internet or television, while others allow worship by opening a parking garage.

The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the spread of the disease, and later shrines were closed, while Saudi Arabia imposed a ban on tourists entering the country, as well as a ban on locals traveling to shrines in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant disruption to the global sporting table since World War II.
Most major sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, 2019-20 NBA season, and 2019-20 NHL season.
The outbreak has delayed plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin in late July.The International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be rescheduled after 2020, but no later than summer 2021.Casinos and other gambling venues worldwide have closed, and gambling has been postponed or cancelled.
The move has seen many gamblers switch to online gambling, with many online gambling sites reporting a significant increase in the rate of new signups. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various bands suspending or cancelling concerts.
Many major theaters, such as on Broadway, have suspended all performances.
Some artists have found ways to continue producing and sharing their work online, as an alternative to live performances such as online live performances or creating a festival on the web for artists to perform, distribute and showcase their work.
Online, online humor related to the coronavirus has become widespread, with many people liking to joke and to relieve feelings in times of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, increased xenophobia and racism have been noted against Chinese and people of East Asian origin and against people from highly infected countries in Europe, the United States and other countries.
The phenomenon of fear, suspicion and uncertainty is observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia Pacific region.
The February report (when most cases of infection were confirmed from China) showed a racial bias towards various Chinese communities around the world that they deserve to get the disease or receive what is considered a legacy for what they have done.
Some countries in Africa have also seen expressions of anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many people in Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on their ethnicity.
There is support for the Chinese people both online and offline, and for those in the restricted zone where the virus is present.
With the recent spread of the disease to other countries, people from Italy, the first European country to experience severe COVID-19 infections, have fallen into suspicion and xenophobia.People in countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have begun to sign up to petition to ban Chinese from entering their countries to stop the spread of the disease.
In Japan, the #BanningChinese sign has high ratings on Twitter.
Chinese people, as well as other Asian people in the UK and US, have reported increasing levels of racial abuse as well as gender-based violence.

Laboratory testing for the novel respiratory illness 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect the tissue produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in the sample was confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects RNA of the coronavirus.
The test is specific and designed to detect only the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm recent infection or activity.
Serology can be used both for diagnosis and for population monitoring.
Antibody tests reveal the number of people with the disease, including those who are asymptomatic and those with few symptoms to report.
The accuracy of the mortality rate and the level of immunity of the human population can be determined by the results of the tests.
Due to limited testing as of March 2020, no country has reliable data on the rate of infection in their population.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there was a significant variation in the number of tests performed nationwide.
This variation is also likely to have a significant impact on the mortality rate in reported cases, which is likely to be overestimated in some countries.
Using polymerase chain reaction of real-time transcription (rRT-PCR), testing can be performed on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including sound, nasal, ventral or urethral samples, etc.
Results are generally available within hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR testing performed with pancreatitis is reliable only in the first week of the disease.
The virus can then disappear back into the esophagus as it travels to the lungs.
For infected people who are tested in the second week, replacement samples can be taken from the deep respiratory tract with a cardiac catheter or a cough suppressant.
One of the first PCR tests was developed at Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using real-time transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and has created a base of 250,000 for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed a test by 23 January 2020; South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a treatment class based on SARS-CoV-2 (PowerChek coronavirus) instrument PCR on 28 January 2020.
"The method looks for the ""E"" gene distributed by all coronavirus and the specific RdRp gene for SARS-CoV-2".In China, BGI Group was the first company to receive emergency use approval of a SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detector from China's National Medical Products Administration.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing the transmission chain polymerase chain reaction diagnostic chart of the new 2019 (2019-nCoV) coronavirus to its National Institutes of Health for clinical trials".
One of the three genetic testing kits in the older generation of testing yielded uncertain results due to errors and complications of testing at the CDC in Atlanta, resulting in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully run throughout February 2020.
Testing with two metals was not determined reliable until February 28, 2020, and it was not until state and base laboratories were allowed to begin testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the Commercial Laboratories Emergency Use Authorization.The Commercial Laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the provision of nationwide COVID-19 testing based on RT-PCR.
Diagnostics of the search expedition were established nationwide, with COVID-19 testing services available from 9 March 2020.
No quantitative limits have been announced, and sampling and processing must be done according to CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the state-run VECTOR Laboratory Research and Biotechnology.
On March 12, 2020, the Mayo Clinic reportedly developed a test to look for COVID-19 infection.On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that can be performed in 3.5 hours at high doses, thus allowing one machine to perform approximately 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on Abbott's m2000 system.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid received an EUA from the FDA with a test that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR technology.
Because it does not require a continuous cycle of reflected temperature, the method can give a positive result in five seconds and a negative result in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the United States, and Abbott expects to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day, a test that uses a monoclonal antibody specifically bound to the N-protein of the new coronavirus that is developing in Taiwan, with the hope that it can provide results in 15 to 20 minutes, similar to a rapid immunoassay.
"The March 2020 literature review concluded that chest X-rays are of little value in early stage diagnosis; CT findings [imaging of any site of body tissue] may be present even before symptoms appear".
Common features on CT include smoothness of the bi-dimensional multi-lens with back partitions, irregular shapes, and material.
Multiple excesses under the pulmonary artery, splenic artery, and coagulation develop as the disease evolves.
A comparative study between polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and CT in Wuhan, the origin of the current epidemic, showed that CT is more novel than PCR, with many features of its imaging synchronized with pneumonia and other pathologies, although not specific.
"In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended""CT should not be used for imaging or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19"."In March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for initiation of follow-up".
Part of the immune system's response to infection is the production of antibodies, which include IgM and IgG.
These can be used to identify individual infections starting at 7 days or after onset of symptoms, to determine immunity, and in population monitoring.
Advanced process automation systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these analyses, but the availability of the system will depend on the production rate for each system.
For single samples that replace transfusions, CLT is often used, although a sequential sample may be used to monitor the immune system response.
For PoCT, a single blood sample is usually obtained by scalp.
Unlike PCR, the extraction step is not required before administration.On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 entities that notified the agency as required and can now distribute their own sample tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorization.At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Diagnostic Medical Laboratory and Epitope Diagnostic received European approval for their test kits that can protect IgG and IgA antibodies against viruses in blood samples.
The test is capable of hundreds of samples in just a few hours and is therefore faster than the claims of PCR of RNA viruses.
Typically, the virus can be detected within 14 days of the onset of infection.In early April, the UK found that none of the virus test kits it purchased were of sufficient quality for consumption.
"Hong Kong has developed a scheme whereby suspected patients can stay at home ""The emergency department will give the patient a sample"" they collect the sample, send the sample back and a while later they will get the test results. The British National Health Service (NHS) has announced that they are testing the scheme to test suspected cases at home which could reduce the risk of transmission of the disease to others if they are hospitalized or if an ambulance is available with a virus if needed.
The pilot centre has helped South Korea perform the fastest and most comprehensive testing of any country.In Germany, the National Health Insurance Medical Center in Metz said on 2 May that it has the capacity for testing about 12,000 people a day in the ambulance facilities and 10,700 were tested in the previous week.
The cost is covered by health insurance when the test is ordered by a doctor.
According to Robert Koch Institute director, Germany has a total capacity for 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, testing has been delivered in some major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests in Germany is unknown, as only positive results have been reported.
The initial laboratory survey showed that as of week 12/2020, a minimum of 483,295 total samples had been tested, and counting week 12/2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at the Israel Institute of Technology (Technion) and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method for sampling from 64 patients at a time by collecting samples and testing further, but in that case, only the samples collected were found to be of positive quality.
With construction supervised by BGI founder Wang Jian and taking 5 days, the Hubei computer case model has already been set up at over 47%, while the cost associated with the isolation of the computer has doubled if the testing capability is not utilized.
The Wuhan lab was immediately followed by the Hu-Yan lab in Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Beijing and Shanghai in 12 cities across China.
On 4 March 2020, the total number of tests was 50,000 per day. Open source design by Origami Assays was released, which tested 1,122 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced designs can be run in small labs without the need for robotic detection devices.
In March, the lack and insufficient amount of conversion became a barrier to large-scale testing in the European Union and the United Kingdom and the United States.
This led some authors to seek a pre-sampling ceremony involving heating the sample to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to extract the RNA gene for further testing.On May 31, it was announced that Saudi Arabia is testing more of its population for the coronavirus in the head than any other country and is on track to expand the scope of testing to reach the majority of the population.
"This is through a combination of leverage and the purchase of a large laboratory from the population from Group 42 and BGI (based on their Hu-Yan" emergency detection laboratory in China)".
Built in 14 days, the lab has the capacity to perform tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first in the world to operate outside of China.
Different test forms focusing on different aspects of the virus's genetic variants have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has received a German grant for manufacturing equipment sent to low-income countries without the resources to develop themselves.
The German version was published on 17 January 2020. The document, developed by the US Centers for Disease Control, was not available until 28 January.Existing testing delays in the United States and the United States have problems with the reliability of testing equipment in the early stages of the outbreak, and these countries and Australia do not have the capacity to supply sufficient equipment to meet the requirements and recommendations for testing by health professionals.
On the other hand, experts say South Korea's extensive testing is slowing the spread of the new coronavirus.
Testing capabilities, mostly in private sector laboratories, have been developed over the years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for an increased testing program, which is the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in advance.The high demand for testing due to the spread of the virus has resulted in hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States and an orderly supply for washing machines, dispensers, and materials for chemical testing.
In March 2020, China reported problems with accuracy in their testing equipment.
"In the United States, the test was developed by the CDC to be ""quality""; the government then removed the diplomatic blockade that prevented private testing. Spain purchased the test from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found the results to be inaccurate".
The company explained that the incorrect results could be due to failure to collect samples or use the equipment properly.
The Spanish Ministry said it would withdraw the devices that gave incorrect results and replace them with different test kits provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80 percent of the fake test kits in the Republic purchased from China gave incorrect results.
"Prime Minister Matovič proposed dumping it into the Danube. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said the test kits Turkey purchased from China had a ""high error rate"" and ""have not been put into use""; the UK purchased 3.5 million test kits from China, but in early April 2020 announced that these devices were not available".
Follow-up testing with those who tested positive and follow-up with those who had positive SARS-CoV-2 contact resulted in positive results.
Researchers working in Vò, Italy, the site of Italy's first COVID-19 death, conducted two rounds of tests on a total population of about 3,400 people who were isolated for about ten days.
About half of the people who test positive have no symptoms, and all of the detected cases are isolated.
With limited travel to the prison, new infections can be eliminated completely.
With heavy surveillance, domestic travel restrictions, testing and quarantining in place, the 2020 global coronavirus outbreak in Singapore progressed more slowly than other developed countries, but without severe restrictions such as forcing the closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were cancelled and Singapore began recommending people stay at home on 28 March, but schools reopened in time after the holiday break on 23 March.
Many other countries have also managed the pandemic through stronger contact, internal travel restrictions, testing and quarantine, but with less active home confinement, such as Iceland and South Korea.
The statistical study found that countries with more testing in terms of mortality rates had much lower death rates, probably because these countries were better able to protect against the spread of the disease.
The World Health Organization recommends that countries with no testing capacity and national laboratories with limited COVID-19-related experience send their first five positive and ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the 16 WHO laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Of the 16 target labs, seven are in Asia, five in Europe, two in Africa, one in North America and one in Australia.
"In the table below, the columns ""positive as percentage of testing"" are influenced by the country's testing policy".
A country that tests only people who are hospitalized will have a higher percentage of positive tests than a country that tests all citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, and anything else is the same.
Handwashing, also known as hand sanitization, is the act of a person washing their hands in order to remove dirt, grease, dirt, or other unwanted substances.
Hand washing with soap at certain important times of the day prevents the spread of various diseases, e.g. pneumonia and oral infections.
People can also contract respiratory illnesses such as the common cold or influenza, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (e.g., sneezing).
The five most important daily situations to wash hands with soap include before and after loading, after washing the baby's crib or moving the baby's toilet, before putting the baby in the oven, before eating, and before or after preparing food or cooking fish and poultry.
The World Health Organization recommends hand washing: We can wash our hands with a towel if there is no water and soap.
Before, during, and after preparing food.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing the baby's diaper or cleaning the baby's toilet.
After you rub your nose, cough or sneeze.
After touching an animal, animal droppings, or animal waste.
Psychological hand-washing focuses on the practice of hand-washing in relation to the instructional approach of the teacher.
Hand washing before using medication or medical treatment can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The main medical purpose of handwashing is to wash hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
It is particularly important for those who manage food or work in medicine, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases, preventing the spread of infectious diseases, reducing respiratory infections.
And reduce the infant mortality rate at home birth.
A 2013 study showed that handwashing practices may gradually improve the fertility of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and stroke can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes such as hand washing with soap, etc.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote handwashing can reduce stroke by about a third, comparable to clean water supply in low-income areas.
48% of reductions in asthma can be linked to handwashing with soap.Handwashing with soap is one of the most effective and cost-effective ways to prevent asthma and other respiratory infections (ARI), a practice that should be practiced in facilities, schools and communities worldwide.
Pneumonia, the major ARI, is the number one cause of death among children under five, killing about 1.8 million children a year.
Cancer and pneumonia together account for nearly 3.5 million child deaths each year.
According to UNICEF, making hand washing with soap before eating and after bathing a life-saving practice is more than any vaccination or medical intervention by reducing deaths from malaria by nearly half and deaths from respiratory infections by a quarter.
Handwashing is usually combined with other sanitation interventions as part of the water, sanitation and hygiene program.
Handwashing can also protect against hand-inflammatory diseases transmitted through direct contact.
A small side effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage due to drying of the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can cause a skin rash known as manic-depressive disorder or manic-depressive disease, which is common among health care workers.
Frequent hand washing is also seen as a symptom of multiple sclerosis.
The five key times a day you need to wash your hands with soap are to reduce infection by contact with saliva and mouth: after using the toilet (sweat the small and large feet), after washing the cats, after changing the baby's milkshake, before giving food to the baby, after eating, and before or after preparing food or cooking food or handling fish or poultry.
Other occasions when proper handwashing techniques should be applied to prevent transmission include before and after treating a wound or a stick; after coughing, sneezing or chewing your teeth; after touching animal waste or animal contact; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, hand washing with soap is still low.
A 2015 handwashing study conducted in 54 countries found that an average of 38.7% of households practiced handwashing with soap.The 2014 study showed Saudi Arabia had the highest rate at 97%, the United States at 77% and China at 23%.
The Essential Health Care Program implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a grassroots effort to promote children's health and education.
Insect repellent twice a year plus daily hand washing with toothpaste daily with fluoride is the highlight of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of the skin is done by adding soap or soap to the water.
The main activity of soaps and disinfectants is to reduce the solubility barrier and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective skin cleansing agent because fats and proteins, which are the building blocks of soil organisms, are insoluble in water.
However, strong flowing water can help wash away the leak.
Because in general, solid soap that we can recycle contains bacteria, stains and soap after one use.
A small study looking at bacterial transplants from soap containing a diluent concluded that transplants seem unlikely to be bacterial transplants because they are already washed away with soap.
"The CDC still says ""soap water in a can with a compressor head is better"."
They have spread widely from antibacterial soaps to public health.
To date, there is no evidence that any recommended antimicrobial or bacterial use is selective for antibiotic-resistant tissue in nature.
However, bacterial soap contains a common antibacterial agent, tryptophan, which is highly resistant to the maximum pressure of body tissue.
So if they don't select a few bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics, then the antibacterial soap won't be as effective as advertised.
In addition to the ingredients of pulmonary, surgical, and skin-protective agents, the counterfeit formulas contain ph-activating acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid, disinfectants, and skin-protective creams (such as garlic extract, vitamins, and natural ingredients).An analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health has suggested that regular soap is as effective as triglosan-containing disinfectants in preventing hand-to-hand infections and killing germs.
Hot water that is suitable for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria reproduce very rapidly at body temperature (37 °C).
However, industrial hot water, soap, and water are more effective than cold water and soap in cleaning up the soil and bacteria-containing natural oils.
Scientific studies, contrary to popular belief, have shown that using hot water is not effective in reducing microbes on the hands.
Alcohol-based hand washing or hand sanitizer is a water-free hand sanitizer.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, the waterless hand sanitizer, alcohol (also known as alcohol washing water, hand sanitizer, hand sanitizer) began to gain popularity.
Most are based on isopropylene alcohol or ethanol, forming together with raw agents such as carburetor (a polyethylene material of acrylic acid) into gels or other substances such as glycerin into liquids or foams to facilitate use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
Adding the chemical compound hydrogen-peroxide increases the activity of disinfection. Hand washes containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol are effective enough to kill germs
Alcohol washes away common bacteriocides, drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), some diseases and viruses (including AIDS, Ebola virus, RSV, influenza, influenza, influenza, and hepatitis) and compounds.
Alcohol-based handwashing disinfects 70% alcohol, kills 99.97% reducing3,5 equivalent to a reduction of 35 decibels) of bacteria on the hand 30 seconds after use and 99.99% to 99.999% (reducing 4 to 5 locks) of bacteria on the hand 1 minute after use.Alcohol-based handwashing is most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcoholic handwashing is almost ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk), the most common cause of parathyroid infection. Adequate handwashing or alcohol washing must be used to inhale or cover the hands with the side joint.
The thumb, both arms and between all fingertips are boiled for about 30 seconds until the liquid is brown or dry.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands with water and disinfecting hands, especially when the hands look dirty.
The increased use of these agents is based on ease of use and rapid killing activity against common pests.But they should not replace proper hand washing unless soap and water are available.
Frequent use of disinfectant hand washes can cause dry skin to develop unless skin loading and/or skin moisture is added to the mold.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin oil and/or other skin-bending substances to the formula.
In clinical experiments, hand washing containing dermal fillers caused less skin inflammation and dry skin than soap or a remarkable microbicide.
Skin inflammation from exposure to anything with allergenic patches, symptoms of gastroenteritis, strong alcohol poisoning, or exposure to alcohol or additives in hand sanitizer is rare.
Less practice can cause inflammation of the skin caused by exposure.The wave reaction has become an attraction compared to hand washing with soap and water.
Besides its effectiveness, the non-water agent cannot wash hands with those microorganisms, but can kill those microorganisms in a simple way.
For this reason, hand washing is not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogenic microorganisms, as pathogens are still on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free handwashing is highly dependent on ingredients and formulas, and historically, alcohol and handwashing have been ineffective.
Recently, the formula using benzalkonium has been shown to have continuous and gradually increased antibacterial activity after application, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to have decreased efficacy after repeated use, probably due to gradually increased skin reactivity.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford to buy soap and use it instead of cotton or land.
Washing with a towel or soil may be more effective than washing with one face of water, but it is not as effective as washing with soap.
One concern is that if soil or soil is contaminated with microorganisms, it could increase the spread of the disease rather than reduce it.
The bark is also a disinfectant like soap, because when it comes in contact with water, it forms an alkaline sulfide.
The World Health Organization recommends using a bed or sand as an alternative when soap is not available.
Proper handwashing techniques are recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent infection, which include the following stages:
Shower with hot or cold running water.
It is recommended to use running water because the tank may be opaque while the temperature in the water does not seem to make a difference.
Washing the hands with soap, rubbing them with a large amount of soap, including the neck, fingertips, and under the elbow.
Soap can remove germs from the skin, and studies have shown that many people are more inclined to wash their hands thoroughly when using soap than when using water.
Turn for at least 20 seconds.
Washing creates a cut that removes germs from the skin, and longer washing will help remove germs more easily.
Wash thoroughly under the running water.
Bathing in a tub (with or without running water) can re-infect your hands.
Take a clean towel and dry your hands or let them dry in the wind.
The hands and hands that are infected with urine are more susceptible to re-infection. The most common areas of infection are the palms of the hands, the area between the fingers and the base of the wrist.
Artificial yeast and yeast-killing drugs can be a haven for body microbes.
A scented wash is often recommended to keep hands from drying out. Dry skin can lead to skin damage, which can increase the risk of infection.
A number of low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing where there is no mechanical water and/or soap, e.g. draining from a drain tank or suitable tap and/or using a tap if necessary in developing countries. In situations where water supply is limited (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water conservation solutions such as "tippy-taps" and other low-cost options.
The water tank is a simple technology where you use a water tank that is filled with a string and you use your feet to pour a small amount of water on your hands and a piece of soap.
Effective hand drying is an important part of the handwashing process, but there is some debate about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
A growing body of research has shown that toilet paper is more humane than the hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, a study led by the University of Westminster, London and co-sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium industry, compared the humidity levels obtained from toilet paper and hand dryers and other modern hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to be increased on the towel, an average of 194% and on the palm of 254%.
Drying with a dryer causes an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the palm of the hand by 42% and on the palm by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with toilet paper, the total number of bacteria was reduced on average on the towel by up to 76% and on the palm by up to 77%.The scientists also performed tests to determine whether or not there was a potential for transmission of infection to other bathroom users and bathroom environments as a result of each drying method.
The dryer, which blows wind out of the machine at 180 m/s (650 km/h 400 mph), is capable of expelling microorganisms from the hand and the dryer, and can cause blindness to other bathroom users and the surrounding environment within 2 meters.
The use of drying machines can extend the radius of the small body up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Toilet paper does not show any micro-sweating. In 2005, a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwel evaluated several different hand-drying techniques.
Observations of the changes in bacterial populations after dry hands were found as follows:
Various manufacturers of hand dryers have come into existence, and hand dryers have been compared to toilet paper dryers.
Handwashing is an option when we travel without enough soap and water.
Alcoholic hand washes should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical handwashing became a necessity after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing infections in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that give the ability to remind hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget to do so.
One study found that infection rates decreased with their use.
Medical handwashing is for at least 15 seconds, using a suitable amount of soap and water or salt to rinse and exfoliate each part of the hand.
We should be encouraging one another by our prayers.
You should use a rope to remove the stitches under the wrist if they are present.
It is very important to wash your hands thoroughly and dry them with a clean towel, as germs may remain in the water on your hands.
After washing, use a toilet to close the water (and open any exit doors if necessary).
This is to prevent re-infection from the hands to the surfaces.
The purpose of handwashing in healthcare settings is to eliminate infectious viruses and prevent their transmission.
The New British Medical Journal reports that handwashing is still at an unacceptable level in most medical centres, with most doctors and clinicians neglecting to wash their hands before contacting patients, leading to widespread transmission of the virus.
One study showed that hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of blood clot-related bloodstream infections by 66 percent.The World Health Organization has published a guideline paper outlining hand washing and hand sanitization in healthcare.
The organization's hand sanitization guidelines are also available on its website for public comment.
A relational review was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercial equipment can measure and disinfect hands if demonstration of the need to apply over-the-counter measures.
The World Health Organization has five hours for hand washing:
After contact with blood or body fluids
Before the disinfection and
After patient care, adding a chemical that kills germs to soap (a "drug" or "disinfectant") can trigger a disinfectant reaction in hand-washing agents.
Such disinfection may be desired prior to surgery or in areas where bacteria are highly resistant to antibiotics. Therefore, washing your hands during surgery requires a rubber rubbing pad, untouched, with chlorhexidine or iodine hand wash, a clean towel for hand dryers, a wash cloth for towels, and a non-microbial tool for underhand cleaning.
All jewelry should be removed.
This form requires hand washing and hand rubbing, usually for 2-6 minutes.
The length of the delay (10 minutes) is not necessary.
They must prevent the water from reaching the hands when washing the hands.
Take a clean towel, wash your hands after washing and dry them, and put on a surgical jacket.
To reduce the spread of infection, it is advisable to wash or disinfect your hands before and after caring for a patient.
For the management of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit from hand washing was derived from the first 20 percent cleaning, and the very few additional benefits derived from frequent hand washing were increased to over 35%.
Handwashing with plain soap still has three times more bacterial transmission from food compared to handwashing with bacterial disinfectant soap.A comparison between handwashing with alcohol and handwashing with bacterial disinfectant soap for the same 30 seconds showed that handwashing with alcohol reduced bacterial transmission by 26% more than disinfectant soap.
But soap and water are more effective than handwashing in disinfecting H1N1 viruses and reducing the spread of Clostridium by the hands.Meetings to improve hand hygiene in healthcare settings may involve educating staff about handwashing, promoting handwashing with alcohol and reminding staff verbally and verbally.
There is a need for further research into which interventions are most effective in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective tool for good health and access to nutritious food.
But the lack of reliable supply of clean water, soap or handwashing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces makes it difficult to achieve universal handwashing practices.
For example, handwashing facilities in most rural areas in Africa, near private and public toilets, are scarce, despite being an expensive alternative in the construction of handwashing facilities.
However, this low rate of handwashing may be more due to improper handwashing than to a lack of water or soap.
Promoting and advocating for handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, increase awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and lead to long-term behavioral change.
For this work to be effective, monitoring and evaluation are essential.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches were effective in increasing handwashing in LMICs while social marketing campaigns were ineffective.One example of school handwashing promotion is the Three Key Ways by UNICEF, which encourages schools to implement simple, low-cost steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other criteria.
When the minimum standards are met, the school can change from one star to the highest three stars.
Building more handwashing facilities is part of the handwashing promotion that provides a reduction in infectious diseases and reduced child mortality.
The Universal Handwashing is another example of an awareness campaign that is trying to achieve a behavioural change.As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus outbreak, UNICEF has promoted the adoption of emotional handwashing.
A small number of studies have considered the overall cost-effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries associated with DALYs.
But one review found that promoting handwashing with soap was actually less expensive than other hygiene and water interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health, and especially for those in vulnerable situations such as mothers who have just given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two hand-translators: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and the Englishwoman Florence Nightingale, the founder of modern nursing.
At the time, most people still believed that infection was caused by bad smells called miasmas.
In the 1980s, an outbreak of foodborne and healthcare-related infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to actively promote hand hygiene, an important means of preventing the spread of infection.
After the 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 global COVID-19 pandemic, some countries have realized that hand washing with soap is indeed important in protecting themselves from infection.
For example, signs with the words "technique of hand washing correctly" are displayed next to hand washing facilities in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports in Germany.
To say "wash your hands to wash something" means to declare no responsibility for something or to share in the integrity of it.
It originated in the biblical text in the Gospel of Matthew, where Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a proverb with a wider use in some English communities.
The character Mabel in the comedy begins to clench her hands by attempting to clean up the mess of fantasy that represents her sense of guilt for the crime she committed and urged her husband to commit.
They found that people after remembering or thinking about immoral behavior were more likely to think about washing their hands than others and were more likely to value hand washing devices.
Furthermore, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such a brainstorming are less likely to engage in "brainwashing" or other cleaning activities than volunteers.
Some have claimed that hand washing is for anonymity and symbolism among other purposes. The symbolism of washing hands with water without soap is part of the characteristic of hand washing in some religions, including the Bahá'í Faith, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Vodou in Islam. All of these religions also specify that one should wash one's hands, especially after a specific activity.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands after bathing.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam require washing hands before and after eating.
Workplace risk management in the face of COVID-19
Workplace hazard management for COVID-19 is the implementation of occupational safety and health approaches for the management of hazards to prevent the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19).
Workplace hazard monitoring is workplace- and occupational-specific, based on an assessment of the risk source of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and the individual risk factors of the employee who may be susceptible to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk workplaces have few contacts with the public and other coworkers, who are advised to use basic infection prevention measures, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, routine routine procedures, and maintaining the hygiene and disinfection of the work environment.
Moderate-risk occupations include those who require frequent or close contact with people who do not know or suspect COVID-19 but may be infected by ongoing community infections or international travel.
This includes employees who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, densely populated workplaces, and some high-end retail locations.
Risk management for this group in addition to basic infection prevention measures include ventilation with high-efficiency ventilation, a coating and personal protective equipment available in case of contact with COVID-19 patients.
OSHA considers health care and cemetery workers who are known or suspected of having COVID-19 to be at high risk by direct exposure, which increases the risk if the employee conducts a routine routine routine or collects or disposes of samples from people who are known or suspected of having COVID-19.
Hazard management for these personnel includes engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation chambers and work-appropriate personal protective equipment.
The COVID-19 outbreak may affect some workplaces.
Employees may be absent from work because of illness, caring for others, or fear of potential exposure.
Trade patterns can change both in terms of what goods are demanded and the means of obtaining these goods (such as by walking around shopping at peak hours or through transport or driving services).
Finally, freight transportation from geographic areas severely affected by Covid-19 has been suspended.The response and preparedness plan for the pandemic may be used to guide preventive actions.
Plan for addressing the level of work-related and occupational risks, including exposure sources, risk factors arising from housing and community settlement, and individual employee risk factors such as age or mental health conditions.
They also outline the management needed to address those risks and the preparedness plan for situations that may arise as a result of an outbreak.
Preparedness and response to infectious diseases may be the subject of national or sub-national recommendations.
The goals for responding to the outbreak include reducing transmission among employees, protecting people at high risk for adverse health outcomes, maintaining business operations, and reducing negative impacts to other entities in their supply chains.
The severe disease situation in the community is because businesses in the affected areas are responding.
Hazard sequencing is a widely used framework in occupational safety and health for effective group risk management.
When the risks of COVID-19 are unavoidable, the most effective management is engineering management, followed by administrative management and ultimately self-defense.
Engineering management involves keeping employees out of work-related hazards independent of worker behavior and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative management is the change of work policies or procedures that require action from the worker, employee or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent some challenges.
All types of PPE must be selected based on the hazard to workers, staff fitted as accurately as practicable (e.g. respirators), worn in order and properly checked, maintained and replaced as necessary, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to prevent transmission.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs have fewer workplace interactions with the public and other coworkers.
Infection prevention measures recommended for the workplace include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home if they are sick, respiratory symptoms including cough and wheezing, providing toilet paper and restraints, preparing for teleconferencing or changing the dishwasher if necessary, discouraging employees from using other people's tools and equipment, and maintaining the cleanliness and disinfection of the work environment.
Identifying and quarantining individuals who may be infected is an important step in protecting employees, customers, guests and others at the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) requires that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness must rest at home until they have a fever, chills, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without taking a painkiller or other symptomatic medication, and that the sick leave policy is flexible, allowing employees to stay at home to care for a sick family member, and that employees are aware of those policies.
According to OSHA, moderate-risk occupations include those who require frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 meters) of a person who is unknown or suspected to have COVID-19 but may have SARS-CoV-2 because of ongoing community infections around the business location or because the individual has recently traveled internationally to a location with a high prevalence of COVID-19.
These include employees who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, work environments, high density populations, and certain retailers. Engineering management for this group and high-risk groups includes the installation of high-efficiency ventilation, increased air temperature, the installation of protective shields such as plastic, military barriers, and the installation of locks for service personnel.
Employees in this risk group are advised to use respirators.
If a person becomes ill on board, proper screening to protect staff and other passengers includes separating the sick person from others by 6 feet, assigning a staff member to attend to the sick person and giving the sick person a mask, or asking the sick person to empty their mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.
Aircrews should wear disposable medical gloves when caring for sick passengers or contacting body fluids, and may have additional personal protective equipment if the passenger has a fever, constipation, or shortness of breath.
Hands and other disposable items should be disposed of in fuel-free lifeboats, and surfaces containing liquid should be cleaned and disinfected.For commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, hazard management includes delaying travel when sick, isolating oneself, and notifying the onboard medical center immediately if anyone has a fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up should take place in the classroom of a normal person. For schools and child care facilities, the CDC recommends temporary closures to clean or disinfect if an infected person is in the school building, regardless of the spread in the community.
When there is minimal to moderate community referral, social distancing strategies can be implemented such as skipping field trips, conferences, and other large gatherings such as physical education or band classes or meals at coffee shops, increasing the gap between tables, surprising arrivals and expulsions, limiting the number of unnecessary visitors, and using separate health office locations for children with AIDS-like symptoms.
When there is a high transportation in the base community in addition to social distancing strategies, extended schooling may be considered.For law enforcement personnel who perform daily activities immediately, they are considered low-risk health by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who must contact individuals who have been confirmed or suspected of having COVID-19 are advised to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including proper personal protective equipment.
If disconnected during this stress period, employees should clean and disinfect their bands and pads before reusing them with a scarf or towel and follow standard procedures for storing and disposing of used medical equipment, as well as storing and disposing of clothing.
OSHA considers some health care and funeral home workers to be at high risk, the category of exposure risk.
High-risk jobs include providing health care services, laboratory support, and medical transportation personnel who are identified as suspected COVID-19 patients.
These have become high-risk situations if staff perform procedures to generate ventilation or collect or hold samples from known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Methods for the qualitative separation of solids or liquids into gases include injection, coagulation, pulmonary imaging, dental procedures and examinations, or collection of infectious samples.
Funeral homes are high-risk jobs, including workers involved in preparing human cadavers who knew or suspected a COVID-19 case at the time of their death.All these positions are at high risk if they are transplanted.Additional engineering controls for these risk groups, such as isolation rooms for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, are also included when the procedures for creating devices where the body can be shot in small pieces are implemented.
Specialised negative air pressure may be appropriate in some health care facilities and cemeteries.
Samples should be carefully stored in advance according to biosecurity level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be isolated into different waiting zones depending on whether they are suspected cases of COVID-19.In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends the use of respirators for those working within 6 feet of known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 patients and those undergoing respiratory procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 or better facial respiratory masks are used in the context of a broad spectrum of respiratory protection programs that include appropriate testing, training, and surgical procedures.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve the comfort of the staff.WHO has not recommended procedures for wearing masks, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than a fluid-borne disease.
The World Health Organization has recommended surgical masks for entry control personnel only.
For those collecting respiratory samples, caring for or transporting COVID-19 patients without solid- or liquid-to-gas separation procedures, WHO recommends the use of medical masks, eye protection or face shields, gloves and gloves.
The process of creating solid or liquid-to-gas separation was implemented, with the mask replaced by N95 or FFP2 masks.
As the global supply of PPE is inadequate, WHO recommends reducing the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical devices such as clear windows allowing only those involved in direct care to enter the room where the COVID-19 patient is present, using only the PPE needed for the specific job, continuing to use the same respirator without taking it out while caring for multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain for PPE, and encouraging the use of screening for asymptomatic individuals.

Subject: [COVID-19] Bearing the Burden and Preparing for the Future
Date and time of posting: 14 March 2020 at 00:24 UTC
The following is a list of the most popular and most popular websites in the world.
This month, we realize that we are in a very interesting situation.
The COVID-19 pandemic is what clearly demonstrates the interconnectedness between humans and our world and the responsibilities we have towards each other.
We don't have a model for its challenges, but we know that our best response depends on the kind of global understanding, cooperation and community building that is at the heart of the entity.
The photography and attention we've seen among all our colleagues through emails, phone calls and chats is a remarkable empowerment of the incredible people we've been fortunate enough to work with.
For what can I be more grateful or proud of than that you are my fellow workers?
Last week, people came to me and said they appreciated our work.
They heard me what it means for the world to be able to look to Wikipedia now and what a powerful signal it is for this important resource to be online and available to everyone.
Your work makes this possible whether you keep this site up or our colleagues pay or our community is safe.
The world needs the information Wikipedia provides now more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do, but how we do it will impact the world.
Because this mission is important and your role, we're going to make some adjustments to the way we work together, starting next week.
The Bible says: "The one who is in the truth is in the truth".
As Robyn mentioned earlier, Team C met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we discussed what we thought was the appropriate response to what we were facing and the best way to make the organization sustainable during this time.
Moreover, we want to eliminate tensions and support our mission in the long run.
If you need to call back, no problem.
For all employees, contractors and employees:
Our daily work expectation will be about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week until further notice.
We don't announce a day off - if you can work overtime, the mission may need you.
However, the world is unpredictable right now, and whether you need to take care of a loved one, buy a cosmetic, or see a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We don't track your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
It should be silent, but we are.
No pain date or PTO required - just tell your manager and help your team revise the schedule and schedule to make sure the most important parts of the job are covered.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, please notify Bryan in T&amp;C Ops so that T&amp;C can provide support and ensure that your condition receives proper attention from management.)
Many hours will be fully paid.
We have said it before, and we are committing ourselves again to honoring our commitment to our stewards and fellow employees every hour.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their normal working hours under normal circumstances.
This includes if you are sick and unable to work.
If you work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way of conveying their tension with the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially at times like this.
Again, this is your own care.
We ask that you contact your manager so that we know what to expect and can make adjustments accordingly.
One job is considered necessary.
There are some things we have to keep doing.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust and Safety, and Enterprise teams (among other teams) do important work that may require additional assistance.
We will begin working with all departments to evaluate current objectives and direct our attention to supporting what is necessary for our mission.
There is so much work to do for all of us, we just focus on the most necessary projects.
Slowing down now won't hurt later.
We don't plan to double-check once the pandemic is over.
You will not be expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are now impractical.
We accept the changed context and will work on setting new targets and timelines that are appropriate.
What happened to the program?
To adjust to the new situation and daily working hours expectations, we intend to adjust the timing for delivering our 2020-2021 annual plan.
Our intention is to propose a delay in our 2019-2020 plan, which allows more time for budgeting, to allow employees to prioritize essential work, care for themselves and loved ones, while accepting those who need or intend to cut back on analysis in the next few weeks.
This delay in deadlines greatly reduces the workload, current planning and pressure across the entire entity.
We will present our proposal to the board next week and will update the executives and team in the next step as we have confirmation.
Thank the APP team for their leadership in this mission.
The office environment, touch, and cleanliness
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues based in SF may have been infected with the COVID-19 virus.
However, we took great care, hiring anti-virus cleaners to clean up all the space in the San Francisco office.
They used hospital disinfectants to disinfect all surfaces as well as the waiting rooms and the stairway to our floor.
The building is using a ceremony of personal responsibility that uses products that support the safety of their function.
We felt that the office would be well equipped when we decided to return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which has been sharing its COVID-19 pandemic event with us and all DC base staff members.
As of last week, our DC office has moved to remote hosting in accordance with the guidance shared with the City of San Francisco.
As some of my NYC-based colleagues know, we've also discussed renting a location in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing but may be postponed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our remote colleagues know that this could be a fix and would like to give you some advice:
The meeting should last for a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer is required, consider how they can be broken up over several days.
The Bible teaches that we should be "concerned about the things of God".
Make original video using tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaborative live streaming and connectivity.
Lead to coordinate the meeting, someone to follow the discussion for questions and to keep track of the list of speakers, and someone to help take notes (or take notes collaboratively).
Email tech support if you need a more audible message.
Use health for snacks.
Join #RemoteNetwork in Slack to chat with your co-workers about the work you've done.
HR teams are looking for technical guidance on the web to support the growing fund-wide distribution work.
Last week, we suggested that all community donors cancel Wikimedia-sponsored public events such as editathons until WHO announces that the outbreak has ended.
We let them know that we understand that our proposals for cancellations and other limitations may make it impossible to fulfill agreed aid activities and that no one will be penalized for delaying or modifying those targets.
Next week we'll be following up on more tips on Wikimedia and community conferences and local topics.
The general protest from around the world seems to be both sad and disturbing, but refreshing in its clarity and ability to focus on their own Wikimedia and other communities.
Going forward, CRT is working on a Meta-Wiki page to provide a permanent place for the community to track impact and track our interactions with them.
Keep in touch about COVID-19 related issues
We will send an invitation to your client for next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We'll use this time to share updates, answer your questions, and spend some time interacting.
We all have these problems and are here to help in any way we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to find information from this email and all other important COVID-19-related information on the Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages up to date and all information in one place.
We are working to maintain regular contact with employees living in the most affected countries at the moment.
If you have questions about travel, major events, work, insurance challenges, or anything else you need help with, don't hesitate to contact and work with CRT.
We are here to help provide support and communication as needed.
If you have any questions or concerns, please email Bryan Judan, Global HR Director.
None of these changes should be considered as abandoning our work and responsibilities.
Instead, they are a recognition that now our jobs and responsibilities are likely to need to be reconciled in ways we never have before.
These are steps that we believe are necessary to support each other so that we can continue to work, providing our movement with the support they need and the world with the services they depend on.
Our planned work will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it's time to support each other and create a buffer for the important work that is coming in the weeks and potentially months ahead.
We need you all to make that happen, and so we need you all to take care of yourself and your family so that you can stay at your best when the need arises.
Now wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the rest of the cast (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
ACE2 is an enzyme that is attached to the outer surface of the cells of the liver, blood vessels, heart, kidneys, and stomach.
ACE2 opposes the activity of the enzyme ACE, which is associated with reduction of enzyme-II and increase of Ang (Ang) 1-7, making it a successful drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also acts as a cell entry point for certain coronaviruses.
The human gene is often referred to as hACE2.
Enzymes for the synthesis of enzyme-linked proteins are iron-containing proteins that are located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein is encoded by the N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and the acid transporter domain in the C-thyminal-cholesterol domain.
ACE2 is a type I protein-binding pathway whose enzyme acts directly on the surface of liver and other cells.
An extra cell domain of ACE2 is secreted from the transcriptional domain by another enzyme known as sedase; the resulting dissolved protein subunit is released into the bloodstream and eventually released into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most tissues: ACE2 is bound to the cell walls of type II colon cells, the liver, cells of the small intestine, vascular and endothelial cells, and the smooth muscle cells of the lymph nodes in most tissues.
ACE2 mRNA is also present in the outer layer of the striatum, hypothalamus, and brain cells.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a counterbalance regulator to ACE.
ACE cleaves the hormone anti-oxidase I into the blood clot anti-oxidase II.
ACE2 separates the carboxyl-terminal amino acid from two angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and breaks it down into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also kill a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9] - the drug bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 helps in the synthesis of the SLC6A19 and S receptor amino acids found in Hartnup's disease.
Because the transcriptional protein ACE2 acts as an important entry point into the cell for several infectious viruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS) and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the S1 protein mutation of SARS-CoVs and SARS-CoV2 into the ACE2 enzyme present on the cell surface results in the virus and enzyme's localization and displacement into the endosomes located within the cell.
This process of insertion also requires the presence of the S protein through the release of the TMPRSS2 protein in itself, an inhibition that is under investigation as a potential treatment.This activity has led some to speculate that lowering ACE2 levels in cells may help in the fight against infection.
However, some social scientists and institutions still recommend continued use of ACE inhibitors and ARB treatments.
A systematic review and analysis study released on July 11, 2012 found that ACE inhibitor use was associated with a 34% decrease in the risk of pneumonia compared to non-users.
However, the risk of pneumonia is reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who have previously faced a higher risk of pneumonia, particularly patients with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors has also been linked to a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the outcome is less pronounced than the risk of pneumonia as a whole.
The combination of ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a highly potent treatment for pulmonary embolism, and it promotes improved circulation of blood in the lungs as well as lipopolysaccharide-bound oxygenation, which causes severe respiratory complications.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours, and the onset of activity is 30 minutes longer than the effective duration (duration) of 24 hours.
Several findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a successful drug for those who are intolerant to routine anthocyanin inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases where the activity of the two anthocyanins is enhanced.
The b'COVID-19 app is a mobile app developed to help track contacts in response to the global spread of the coronavirus in 2019-20, for example, identifying the person who came into contact with the infected person.
Many applications have been proposed or made with the official support of some local governments and some public authorities.
Several frameworks for the development of impact tracking software have been developed.
Privacy concerns have been raised, particularly about systems based on tracking the geolocation of app users.
Alternatives for less common intrusions include using Bluetooth signal waves to record the distance near another user's phone.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would be merging the functionality to support Bluetooth-based applications directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in partnership with Alipay, has launched an app that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with someone with COVID-19.
It is available in more than 200 cities in China, and in Singapore, the TraceTogether app is being used.
"The software was developed by a local open-source technology community and will be handed over to the government.North Macedonia has deployed the ""StopKorona!"" Bluetooth application to track exposure to potential infectious persons and provide a rapid response to health authorities".
The programme was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the mobile app is awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
"On 12 April, the Royal Government confirmed that a contact tracing programme was in development and would be rolled out in the coming weeks. Similar programmes are planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid"")".

Ross Anderson, a professor of engineering safety at the University of Cambridge, lists the practical problems that could arise with system-based software, including false positives and ineffectiveness if the software were to be used on a small percentage of the population.
To address concerns about the spread of confusing or potentially dangerous coronavirus apps, Apple has limited the types of institutions that can include coronavirus-related apps in its App Store, limiting them to official or reputable institutions.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy campaigners have expressed concern about the impact of large-scale surveillance using coronavirus software, particularly whether the surveillance architecture created to address the pandemic will be dismantled when the threat is eliminated.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for limits on the type of surveillance.
The institutions announced eight criteria for the government's plan:
"Surveillance must be ""legitimate, necessary and proportionate"".
Continued monitoring and surveillance will be subject to a ceasefire.
Data usage will be determined for the purpose of COVID-19
Data security and anonymity are protected and shown to be protected based on evidence.
Digital surveillance will have to avoid discrimination and hardship.
Any data sharing with third parties will be legally mandated.
There must be protection against violations and the right of citizens to respond to any violations.
Significant participation from all relevant stakeholders will be required, including from public health professionals and the following groups. The Mobility Computer Club of Germany (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have also issued a checklist.
Google/Apple's plan, which aims to solve the problem of serial surveillance by taking tracking cameras out of the operating system of their devices when not needed.
Some countries have used network-based location tracking instead of software, eliminating the need to download software and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, a network for tracking was approved.
Web-based solutions that have the potential to use unanalyzed location data can have a significant impact on privacy.
However, not all systems with a central hub must have a connection to and location data of an individual. The system's passwords are created to be used only to a single central hub in communication (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-software system is used to implement exposure monitoring.
Instead of using a phone app, the system collects information from various sources, including mobile devices that track data and card transactions, and combines this data to create a text message notification sent to individuals who may be infected.
In addition to using this information to inform the public about the contacts, the government has also made the location public, which was allowed due to a dramatic change in privacy laws following the MERS outbreak in the country.
The information is available to the public through a number of apps and websites. Countries including Germany have considered using both centralized and privacy-protection systems.
As of 6 April 2020, details have not been released.
Privacy monitoring is a well-established concept, with significant research dating back to 2013.As of 7 April 2020, several teams of experts have been working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) systems to record the distance near another user's mobile phone.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated, centralised and methodological effort, and not a single ceremony. The ceremony includes the close-up, privacy-preserving, centralised monitoring (DP-PPT/DP-3T), the number of interim contacts (TCN, number of fka communications events, CEN), the privacy-related, multi-faceted ceremony and the camera for mobile phone monitoring (PACT) and others.
According to the ceremony, no private information is leaked from the device itself, and all deliveries are made on the device.
A private team at MIT Media Lab has developed SafePaths, a software platform for using privacy-protecting technologies when collecting and using location or isolation data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research from the official report Targeted Misuse: Privacy in Spread released in March 2020.Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a privacy technology development company originally developed at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share location and sensitive health data with other users and officials without compromising the privacy of that data.

The b'A COVID-19 vaccine is the active vaccine against the coronavirus in 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has been completed, several trials are underway to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization said it did not expect a vaccine against the deadly SARS-CoV-2 virus to be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in the first phase of safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak swept the globe in 2020, leading to massive investment and research efforts to develop a vaccine.
Several institutions are using the promoted genes to develop a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.
The essential actions of the CEPI initiative for vaccine development outlined in April are speed, manufacturing capacity, scale deployment and universal access.
In April, scientists from CEPI reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development in early 2020 to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The key objectives of the Phase I safety study are:
Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (phase I developers and experimental vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
The virus carrier (phase one vaccine manufacturer and tester: CanSino Biologics, 5-vector adenovirus)
According to a team of scientists from CEPI in April, 115 experimental vaccines are in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as projects in progress (79 according to the Milken Institute), 37 more announced, but little public information (assuming things are in planning and development).
Phase I-II trials lead to safety and immunity tests, typically randomized, controlled, and in multiple locations, while defining clear limits of efficacy.
Phase II trials require multiple participants, including control groups, and testing for vaccine efficacy to prevent disease while monitoring for optimal adverse outcomes.
"Of the 79 vaccine candidates currently in active development (confirmed as of early April 2020), 74 are not yet in human evaluation (in "pre-clinical" studies)".

Some vaccines have a sequenced effect, or so-called indirect effect.
That means they may have more benefits than the disease they prevent.
A randomized study in Australia is enrolling 4,170 healthcare workers in the study.
A potential vaccine in development would not be safe or effective.
Recent studies of vaccine efficacy in inhibiting COVID-19 on ACE2-transgenic animals such as turtles, other laboratory animals, as well as non-human primates, all are for Level 3 biosecurity in viral management and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS were tested in animal models, not humans.
As of 2020, no cure or vaccine for SARS has been shown to be safe and effective in humans.
According to studies published in 2005 and 2006, identification and development of a vaccine or treatment for SARS is a top priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.
As MERS spreads, the available pathogenesis studies are believed to provide a useful model for the development of vaccines and treatments against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, one MERS vaccine (DNA-based) has completed phase I clinical trials in humans, and three other phase III clinical trials are in progress, all of which are virus-mediated vaccines.
Social media has revealed a conspiracy theory, claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 has been discovered and that a vaccine is already available.
Patents cited from social media posts refer to existing patents on gene sequences and vaccines for other coronaviruses such as SARS coronaviruses.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes severe respiratory reactions caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, cramping, stomach pain, loss of sense of smell, and stomach pain.
The time from exposure to the first symptoms is about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
While most cases cause symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and tissue damage.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported across 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been cured.The virus is primarily spread between people when they are in close contact, often through small droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or talking.
When these droplets are produced, when exhaled, they usually fall to the ground or surface rather than passing over a long distance.
People are infected by contact with infected skin, then their eyes, nose and mouth.
The virus can survive outside for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after exposure, meaning infection may occur before exposure or at different stages of the disease.The standard diagnostic method is real-time retinal relay-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) viral counts taken from nasal and ventricular samples.
Wearing masks is recommended for those who suspect they have the virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations for masks in public places vary, with some authorities recommending against their wearing, others requiring them, and others requiring them to wear masks.
There is currently no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Domestic infections have been recorded in most countries across the six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may experience no symptoms or develop flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include shortness of breath, chest pain or persistent pressure, confusion, difficulty waking, and darkness in the face or mouth.
Upper respiratory symptoms include fever, diarrhea, or pain.
Symptoms of gastroenteritis such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea are observed at different rates.
Some cases in China initially showed only chest tightness and chest pain.
In some cases, the disease can progress to pneumonia, tissue damage, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The COVID-19 time to symptoms after infection is five to six days, but it can also be between two and 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will develop them within 11.5 days of infection.
The role of these asymptomatic strains in transmission is not yet known. However, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of asymptomatic infections is currently unknown and under study, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reports that 20% of all infections remain asymptomatic during hospital stay.
China's National Health Commission began counting asymptomatic cases in its daily case report on April 1, out of 166 infections that day, with 130 (78%) asymptomatic when tested.
Both the stool and the urine can carry a lot of viruses.
Loud talk is more water-driven than normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that uncontrolled coughing can cause a waterfall to travel up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not generally airborne, National Academy of Sciences scientists have suggested that biogas delivery is possible, and air collectors have been placed in large halls outside people's rooms to generate positive samples for the RNA virus.
Some forms of treatment, such as ventilation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause the external airway to be blocked, thus causing airborne transmission.
While there is concern that it may be transmitted through mosquitoes, the risk is believed to be low.The virus is susceptible to transmission when people have symptoms, while transmission is possible before symptoms emerge, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) noted that while it is not clear how easily the disease spreads, it is generally possible for one person to transmit from two to three others.
Specifically, the virus has been found to be detectable for up to three days on cardboard, up to four hours on plastic (polypropylene) and alloy steel (AISI 304), and up to 99 percent on tires.
However, it varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if used properly.Soap products damage the immune system of the virus, disabling it, as well as cleaning it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical antibiotic), were less effective.In a Hong Kong study, oral urine samples were taken on average two days after the start of admission.
Five of the six patients the first sample tested showed a high viral load, and the sixth patient showed a high viral load on the second day of testing.
The severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is similar to the severe respiratory syndrome of the novel coronavirus, which was first isolated from three patients with pneumonia associated with a cluster of severe respiratory illnesses in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in viruses related to the coronavirus.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which breaks down its defense mechanism.SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The liver is the organ most affected by COVID-19 as the virus enters the host cell via the enzyme-converting anti-oxidase 2 (ACE2) enzyme, which is secreted by the lungs' second type of small airway cells.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a "spike" (peplomer) to bind to ACE2 and insert the host cell.
Exposure to low-grade heart disease was found in 12% of those infected and hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and most were severe.
The incidence of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system problems during the course of the disease, but damage to the heart's blood vessels, heart failure, and heart failure can also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
High rates of pulmonary embolism (31%) and venous embolism (25%) were found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infection and may be related to poor prognosis.Clinical analysis of people who died from COVID-19 found alveolar damage (DAD) and lymphocyte-containing inflammation in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 requires the ACE2 enzyme present on the cells of the gastrointestinal tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms similar to that of a full-blown rash.
In particular, the GM-CSF pathogen released T cells that showed relevance in inflammation as they were associated with IL-6 release from monocytes and severe pneumonia in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocyte penetration has also been reported.
The World Health Organization has announced several ways to detect the virus.
The standard method of testing is real-time reverse polymerase chain reaction (rT-PCR).
The test is usually performed on a sample from the respiratory tract received by the nose; however, a nasal or vaginal sample may also be used.
Results are usually seen within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but these tests require two blood samples separated by two weeks, and the results are very inexpensive.
Chinese scientists can break down the coronavirus and sequence its genes, so laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction tests to detect infections caused by the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, biometric tests (which can detect active infection and whether a person has been infected in the past) are in development but not yet widely available.
Chinese experience with testing has shown accuracy of only 60 to 70 percent.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved immediate drug therapy testing for the first time on March 21, 2020, for use later that month.The diagnostic guidelines issued by the Wuhan University Endowment for Research recommend a method for screening for pathogens based on the specific nature of the treatment and the risk of infection.
Multidimensional mirror compatibility with unequal distribution of materials, components and back is common in early infections.
Subpleural rigidity (a roughening of the lobular septal with alveolar filling as a vein) and mixed connections may occur as the disease progresses.
There is very little data on the microscopic and pathological aspects of COVID-19.
The main diagnostic findings during the incubation period are:
What we can see is: pulmonary fluid, pulmonary heartbeat, pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary artery disease.
There are four main types of viral pneumonia:
Mild pneumonia: pneumonia, pneumonia, abnormal growth of the lung cells, internal inflammation with the penetration of urine and formation of malignant cells.
Severe pneumonia: multiple rupture of the lungs with discharge of fluid from the lungs.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe anaemia.
Treatment of pneumonia: preparation of exudates at the alveolar ventricles and rheumatoid arthritis
Blood: DIC (Disseminated intravenous clotting) leukoerythroblastic reaction of the bone marrow
Precautions to reduce the chance of infection include staying home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing respiratory hygiene, and avoiding contact with the eyes, nose or mouth when not washing hands.
The CDC recommends flushing the mouth and nose with a towel when coughing or sneezing, and recommends using the inside of the palm of the hand if there is no towel.
Proper hand washing after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC has recommended the use of face masks in public as part of its measures to reduce transmission from asymptomatic individuals to infected populations through the closure of schools and workplaces, travel restrictions, and the cancellation of large public gatherings.
The privacy guidelines also include that people keep their glasses at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
No drug is known to be effective in preventing COVID-19.As a vaccine is not expected to be discovered until 2021, a key part of COVID-19 management is attempting to reduce the peak of the pandemic, known as "clockwise collision".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after bathing or when the hands appear to be wet, before eating, and after coughing, sneezing, or sneezing.
The WHO also recommends using hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol content, but only when soap and water are not available.For areas where hand sanitizer is not available, the World Health Organization offers two versions for local manufacturing.
All of these antibodies and microorganisms have increased activity from ethanol or isopropanol.
The chemical compound hydrogen peroxide is used to kill bacteria present in acorns, it is not an active agent for disinfecting on the hands.
Chrysolate is added as a basic preservative.
People are managed by supportive care, which can include liquid therapy, oxygenation, and help reach other important organs that are infected.
The CDC recommends that people who suspect they have the virus should wear a regular mask.
Extracorporeal artificial oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and healthy lifestyles as well as diet are recommended to improve fitness.
Follow-up therapy may be useful for those with mild symptoms of early stage infection.The World Health Organization as well as China's National Health Commission have issued guidance on how to care for hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
Emergency medical specialists and pulmonary specialists in the United States are trying to integrate treatment guidelines from various agencies into a database that can download IBCC's free files.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend the use of acetaminophen instead of ibuprofen for initial use.
Precautions must be taken to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in healthcare settings when using gas-generating forms such as air conditioners or hand dryers.
Health professionals are extremely concerned about people with COVID-19 infection.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended isolation in airborne infection prevention (AIIR) rooms in addition to standard precautions, contact precautions, and airborne infection precautions.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also issued guidance on the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during an epidemic.
Recommended devices are: personal disinfectant, respirator or mask, eye protection and medical hand sanitizer. If respirators are available, they should be used as a priority (instead of masks).
N95 protective masks are approved for industrial use, but the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized masks for use under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but efficacy against any specific biological agents is not guaranteed for off-label use.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of at least hand-made face masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require the application of respiratory aids, but a percentage of cases do.
The type of respiratory assistance for individuals with COVID-19-related respiratory problems is being actively studied for people in hospitals, with some evidence suggesting that ventilation can be avoided with high-level nasal tube aspiration or bi-level positive airway pressure therapy.
Whether these two offer the same benefits for people with serious illnesses is unknown.
Some physicians prefer to be with a mechanical ventilation system that is pathogenic when possible because this technique limits the spread of airborne particles compared to high-flow cannula nasal spray.
Many developed countries lack adequate hospitals, limiting the capacity of health systems to deal with the sudden rise in the number of severe COVID-19 cases requiring adequate hospital care.
One study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed medical assistance of respiratory distress, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people in hospitals with the last COVID-19 infection are admitted to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilators are becoming more efficient as symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are increasing in COVID-19 and oxygenation is becoming more difficult.
High pressure, PEEP and shape-controlled ventilation is necessary to maximize oxygen supply while reducing the risk of lung injury and lung disease.
High-quality PEEPs may not be available on older free-wind engines.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
The broad-spectrum antiviral Remdesivir appears to be the most successful.
Although new drugs may take until 2021 to develop, some of the drugs being tested have been approved for other uses or are already undergoing high-level testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tested in people with serious illnesses.
The World Health Organization has recommended that volunteers participate in trials on the efficacy and safety of the treatment.The FDA has provisionally authorized treatment using your own blood serum as a clinical trial in some cases where patients face serious and even fatal outcomes.
It has not undergone the clinical studies necessary to demonstrate its safety and efficacy for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to combat the spread of the disease.
Users are asked to enter their name and password.
"The software can detect ""close contacts"" using surveillance data and thus be able to predict the risk of infection".
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends that you test yourself, but also notifies local health officials.Big data analysis on mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, cell phone tracking, and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and their contacts in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track the mobile phone data of people suspected of carrying the virus.
Measures have been taken to strengthen quarantine and protect those who come into contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared phone location data with German Federal Government Agency scientist Robert Koch to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to detect the perpetrators of the leak.
Italy's regional health minister Giulio Gallera said he received a notification through the telephone company that 40% of the population was still walking normally.
The German government set up a 48-hour hackathon over the weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid has called on the world to find innovative solutions to the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may experience stress from the lab, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection.
"The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, ""The rise of social isolation, isolation, health concerns, stress and economic downturn is a powerful storm in endangering people's mental health and well-being"."
The disease can occur in mild, asymptomatic stages or be similar to other common upper respiratory illnesses such as the common cold.
Typically, mild cases recover within two weeks, while those with severe or severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be at high risk of severe infection with COVID-19 based on data from other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is scarce.For some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs, causing pneumonia.
In those most severely affected, COVID-19 can develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which causes bacterial or multi-organ damage to the respiratory tract.
COVID-19-related complications include blood microorganisms, abnormal blood clots, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Abnormalities of blood clotting, particularly increased prothrombin time, were described in 6% of those hospitalized with COVID-19, while abnormal renal function was seen in 4% of the group.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 show elevated liver enzymes.
According to the same report, the average time between onset of symptoms and death is ten days, with five people spending time in the hospital.
However, patients transferred to the ICU have an average of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In the first case study, the mean time from first symptoms to death was 14 days, with a range of six to 41 days.
In the National Health Commission (NHC) study of China, men had a mortality rate of 2.8% and women 1.7% respectively.
A postmortem biopsy of the lung samples showed alveolar damage with fibromyxoid cells exudates in both lungs.
Viral mutations were observed in lung cells.
The lung is a symptom of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Of the 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart failure was characterized by elevated levels of tryptophan or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the US, 89% of hospitalizations have pre-hospital conditions.The availability of medical facilities and the socioeconomy of a region can affect mortality rates.
Estimates of mortality from disease conditions vary because of regional variation, but also because of the complexity of the methods used in estimation.
Not counting the minor cases can lead to miscalculation of mortality rates.
But the fact that the deaths are the result of past related cases may mean that the current mortality rate is overestimated.
Smokers are up to 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die compared to nonsmokers.
Hong Kong hospital authorities found a decline in lung health in some people who recovered from the disease of 20% to 30%, and lung scans showed tissue damage.
It can cause symptoms after intensive treatment after recovery.
As of March 2020, it is unknown whether past transmission provides long-term, effective, and consistent immunity in those who have recovered from the disease.
The immune system has been seen to be highly dependent on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but in some cases, recovery from COVID-19 is by a positive coronavirus test at a later time.
These cases are believed to be a progression of long-term infection rather than a relapse.
The virus is thought to be of natural origin and originated from animals through transmission.
The exact origin is not yet known, but in December 2019 there was an outbreak of widespread transmission of the virus, which promoted human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 cases of COVID-19 infection published in January 2020 in The Lancet revealed the first day of onset of symptoms was December 1, 2019.
The official World Health Organization release reported the onset of the earliest symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Some measures are often used to determine mortality.
These numbers vary regionally and over time, and are influenced by the volume of testing, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, the time since the initial outbreak, and demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and general health.
In late 2019, the World Health Organization assigned the ICD-10 emergency disease code number by U07.1 for deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from clinical diagnosis or COVID-19 pandemic without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the overall case mortality rate was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
Other measures include the mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who died from the disease, and the infectious mortality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) individuals who died from the disease.
These statistics are timeless and follow a specific population from infection through case resolution.
While not all infected people produce antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about how many people have been infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7%) had already died.
In Gangelt, the disease is spread by carnival and by young people, resulting in low mortality rates, and not all deaths from COVID-19 can be officially classified.
Moreover, the German health system is not covered.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have immune antibodies when evaluating blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) were claimed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality was higher for men in studies done in China and Italy.
The risk is highest for men at age 50, with a male-female ratio of just 90.
In China, the mortality rate is 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact cause of this gender difference is unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be involved.
Sexual immune system differences, decreasing prevalence of smoking in women, and men with similarly evolved conditions such as hypertension at a younger age than women all may contribute to higher mortality rates in men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were male, and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were male.
As of April 2020, the US government has not tracked sex-related data on COVID-19 infections.
Studies have shown that viral infections such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS affect men and women differently.
A high percentage of health workers, especially the presidents, are women and they are at high risk of contracting the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease is COVID-19.
World Health Organization (WHO) President Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for when the outbreak was first identified, which was December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid referring to any specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or human group, in accordance with international guidelines for naming that aim to prevent transmission.The virus that causes COVID-19 is designated as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In addition, the WHO uses COVID-19 and the virus that causes COVID-19 in public relations.
"Both disease and virus are commonly referred to as 'coronavirus.'"
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, the World Health Organization recommended 2019-nCoV and novel respiratory illness 2019-nCoV as provisional names for viruses and diseases, in line with the 2015 Guidelines against use in the naming of disease and viral names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.
Due to limited capacity in the standard supply chain, some digital companies are producing healthcare equipment such as nasal sprays and ventilation units.
In one example, when an Italian hospital needed emergency ventilation and suppliers could not deliver on time, a new local company engineered the rear end and produced the 100 needed ventilation overnight.
Immediately after the outbreak of COVID-19, there was a proliferation of false news stories related to the origin, prevention, treatment and general status of the disease, and all of that information was circulated all over the internet.
Humans seem to have the ability to spread the virus to some animals.
The study found no evidence of transmission in pigs, chickens and fish.
No medication or vaccine has been approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research into vaccines for the treatment of COVID-19 is under the leadership of governments, organizations, academics and researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization initiated a "co-clinical trial" to evaluate the efficacy of four existing antiviral therapies and find the most effective combination.
There is no vaccine, but agencies are actively developing it.
Previous studies on SARS-CoVs need to be reused because both SARS-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 can enter human cells via ACE2 receptors.
There are three strategic vaccine trials.
Researchers initially aimed to create a fully-fledged vaccine.
The use of such viruses, whether inactive or dead, is intended to stimulate the immune system response to new infections with COVID-19.
The second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that stimulates the immune system to specific parts of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2+, such research focuses on the S-spike protein, which helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme.
The third strategy is the nucleic acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, a new technology for vaccine creation).
An experimental vaccine derived from one of these strategies will be tested for safety and efficacy.On March 16, 2020, the first vaccine trial began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless gene coding from the virus that causes the disease.Enhanced antibody dependence has been suggested as a potential challenge for the development of a vaccine for SARS-COV-2, but it is controversial.
There are over 300 active live clinical trials underway as of April 2020.
Seven trials were evaluated on pre-approved treatments for chronic fatigue, including four studies on hydrogen peroxide or chlorine.
Most recycled antiviral drugs are supported by Chinese research, with nine Phase III trials of Remdesivir across multiple countries due to report in late April.
A clinical review of the evolution of the COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidate was conducted and was available as of April 2020.Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19: Remdesivir, Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir/Ritonavir and Lopinavir/Ritonavir mixed with Interferon beta.
There is provisional evidence for efficacy by Remdesivir as of March 2020.
Improved disease progression was observed in patients treated with remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Italy.Chloroquine, which was previously used to treat cancer, was studied in China in February 2020 with preliminary results.
But there are calls for a review of the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends only one gram of the drug, and if we use two grams, it is extremely dangerous and even fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an Open Notice authorizing the emergency use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine drugs in accordance with the physician's decision to treat patients with COVID-19. China's 7th Recommendation also authorized the use of interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir drugs against COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high levels of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in clinical trials.
Nitazoxanide was proposed for further study after low inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 was found. Further studies showed that there is a protein release via the serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) receptor, which is essential for SARS-CoV-2 to penetrate cells via ACE2 receptor cells.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for use with or without azithromycin are controversial, as the medical community has argued that these treatments should be used without study.Oseltamivir does not stop SARS-CoV-2 and has no role in the treatment of COVID-19.
This cytokine build-up may be a consequence of the late stage of COVID-19 severity.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may inhibit cytokine cell proliferation.Tocilizumab was also introduced into clinical use, according to the National Health Commission of China, after a small study was completed.
It is in phase 2 of a non-random national trial in Italy after showing positive results in those with severe disease.
Along with serum fluoride blood tests to identify cytokine storms, it is meant to counteract such mutations, which are considered to be the cause of death in people with certain side effects.
The drug interleukin-6 was approved by the FDA based on a post-case study for the treatment of various causes of stress-induced steroid refractory cytokine therapy with CAR T cells in 2017.
To date, there is no randomly controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transfer of antibodies that have been isolated and collected produced by the immune system of COVID-19 recoveries to people who need them is being observed as a method of non-vaccination immunization.
The strategy was tested for SARS with uncertain results.
Virology is the mechanism of action that is anticipated by treatment with activated antibodies to mediate immunity against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms are possible, such as antibody- and/or phagocytosis-dependent cell cytokines.
For example, other forms of inactivated cell therapy using synthetic clonal cell are in development.
The production of serum for recovering patients that has the blood of the recovered from the virus contains a specific antibody to the same virus that is newly developed.
Coronavirus is a group of viruses that are closely related to the symptoms.
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital who later became ill and died of COVID-19 after he spread awareness about the spread of the virus.
