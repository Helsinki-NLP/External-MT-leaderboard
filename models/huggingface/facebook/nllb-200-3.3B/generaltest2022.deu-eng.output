The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee is 40% of the value of the goods...
I'm a big #PRS_ORG# customer, so it's not a problem for me to do that.
All I need is a number or instruction to attach to the package so it can be tracked by you as a returner.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for $249.
Today it costs $179.
I find that very irritating, to be honest.
Do I have to cancel the order and re-order for the better price or is there another way to credit?
I also believe that children should not be encouraged to take on the role of parents for their younger siblings.
However, I feel that older siblings do well to share in caring for their younger siblings in a measured way.
I'll take a look, I'll help, I'll bring the bottle, and so on.
It teaches them responsibility, helps them in the family, and involves them.
As long as they can be children themselves, I don't see a problem.
If your K1 is going it alone for the short time and he's okay with it, that's good.
You are the best judge of whether this is right for your children.
It's not like he's gonna wrap up K2 and watch him fall asleep for hours.
Legally, it's probably questionable, but I'm not sure that's the case.
Maybe that's why the psychologist gave her statement.
Because if something were to actually happen, like a fire, a break-in, an earthquake, an alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether that's a risk you're willing to take is, of course, up to you.
Please help me find the title of a book.
I remember reading a crime thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the whole plot, but I can't remember the title everywhere, maybe someone knows here...
The story was about fear and how to cure it.
At the beginning of the story, a keeper commits suicide by pouring himself with food and going to the kennels of his predatory cats.
The case is taken over by a police commissioner who, after brief questioning, comes to his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats anxiety patients.
The Commissioner has a little niece who's also afraid of fire and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there's another protagonist -- a photographer who is assigned before each suicide anonymously to go to the place of the suicide and document and post the photos on the Internet.
Anyway, it turns out that this therapist is running some kind of underground therapy group where patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses a fear center in the brain and ultimately allows patients to confront their fear in the most extreme way.
(one woman jumps out of the window another drives herself to death)
This facing fear is called "the fight" in the book.
At the end, there's a big showdown at the clinic that had to do with a fire.
This is the crude plot. I'm pretty sure the book was originally written by a French author.
If this plot is known to anyone or if anyone can tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh, no, I don't have the password for the Wi-Fi.
I'll have to contact my husband first.
It could take a while.
What steps do I need to take after that?
Is it possible to get the difference refunded ?
Child, 4 years old, split under the thumbnail

Very hard to reach.
Didn't work and hurt.
Now the kid gets hysterical when we try.
There's no way.
We're going to the doctor tomorrow.

Johnson wants to push for booster shots because of Omicron
The increasing number of Omicron cases is worrying policy and science in the UK.
So by the new year, all eligible adults in England will be offered a shot.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to move ahead even faster than he has planned in the face of rapidly rising Omicron numbers.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second dose, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen on Sunday evening.
The target date was previously the end of January.
The UK Government will provide additional support to help speed up vaccination campaigns in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The EU is also calling for the introduction of a new vaccine for the first time in the world.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose.
"Let's have a booster now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omicron cases were reported in the UK, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared with the previous day, that was a whopping 65 percent increase.
is the full amount of the purchase price refunded on collection?
I'm all for people to use pronouns
I sent out an application.
Today, the invitation to an interview came by mail.
I want to answer the e-mail.
But unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", it's a more complicated name.
I googled him, and depending on where he/she is from culturally, it's either a man or a woman.
I don't know how to write the email.
Can somebody help me, please?
I'm a foreigner and I don't want to step on the feet of an official.
So, everybody should think of pronouns.
I have five books on it.
Four of them.
Only the one I bought today won't work.
Apparently, the chair had an unseen defect in sales.
How else could a cushion damage like this occur after nine months ?
First tried on the #PRS_ORG#.
It's been working for about a year.
Not for another 14 days.
So I used to buy the latest books through the website and then read them on #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8
But there were none.
Now that they're available again, I'd like you to add two chairs to the order and bill me for it.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content warning: I'm going to write a little bit of detail about domestic violence here.
I just need to write something from my soul.
I (21) have a professional relationship with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence.
One issue that really bothers me, and unfortunately it happens all too often, is that many victims don't want to be helped or think we can't help them.
I'm very aware that we can't do everything, and it's not perfect.
But there are few things in my profession that move me more than when I can't do anything about these situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a one-on-one conversation with the perpetrator out of sight and hearing, I can't reach everyone.
I don't know what it is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of ripping the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, and sometimes even very close to tears, is that everyone is worthy of living a life without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't have to put up with violence.
I often wish I could help with that anyway... I know I can't.
It never makes it any easier.
Please, always remember, you are worthy of living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What does the series have to do with "League of Legends"?
Lots of fantasy, lots of complicated names, a breathtaking show: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, recently launched on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the two seasons already announced?
The German Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debacle of the MHP Giants Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least young Johannes Patrick was reliable.
Again, nothing: for the second time in less than three months, the Giants lost at Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick had said, looking back on the Cup defeat at the beginning of October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our stomachs".
The team did not settle down after the game - but increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) -defeat in the Basketball-Bundesliga.
But more than the result, the way the performance was presented was disappointing.
The three-point ratio was only 13%, 4 hits (all from young Johannes Patrick) in 31 attempts - any questions?
The answer was John Patrick: "We just didn't concentrate enough after the victory at Tenerife, and we didn't put into practice what we had trained".
Moving the ball.
The reaction of his opponent Sebastian Gleim was quite different: "It's a great game to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time", said the happy coach.
"It felt like 10,000 people".
Only 750 visitors were allowed to enter the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they paid for their visit.
Not least because BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts scored 22 points and led his team to the playoffs.
"The best player I ever trained", Gleim said.
While in Patrick's team even the top performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed all over the line.
It was only in the final quarter (22:15) that the Giants prevented a total debacle and came up to eight points after being down 39-59.
In addition to John Patrick, Justin Simon scored 12 points.
Fortunately, there is not much time for whining.
Already on Wednesday (19 o'clock) the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different e-mail address, but I changed it.
Yeah, I signed up a couple of months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were denied.
We checked with the legal authorities and wrote to them again.
We originally signed up six months ago.
Max Rabbe is 59
He is able to inspire his audience with new interpretations of hit songs from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on the road with the programme "Good day, sweet luck" - if he can perform.
Actually, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on the stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But it's not going to happen.
The concert has been rescheduled for May 2022 - "on official instructions" to contain the coronavirus.
Other appearances planned for the Advent season will also be cancelled, according to the website of the singer, who is turning 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
Starting in January, the artists will then be looking to catch up on their 2020 dates, which were postponed due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has already sung a lot and liked as a young man.
In Berlin he studied opera singing, and in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchester together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of Schlagern and Chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was awarded many prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - the second place of the charts.
He's made it from the niche to the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, his blond hair combed back and his attention to etiquette, Max Raabe is no longer to be thought of as being outside the current German-speaking music scene.
With the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" he has been on tour since 2020.
Hello #NAME#, is it possible to get a small sample of the furniture in advance?
It can be supplemented with existing furniture and so we could check beforehand whether it matches the colour
It still doesn't work. I can only crave the cover but not leaf through it.
Federal Minister of Housing Klara Geywitz: No new housing is created by expropriation
The new Federal Minister for Construction Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing groups, as called for in a referendum in Berlin.
"Expropriation does not create a single new apartment, it only changes the ownership structure", Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants the assurance that their rent will be affordable for years to come.
A diverse mix of private landlords, cooperatives or housing associations, for example, is the best protection against monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, the Greens and the Left Party wants to set up an expert commission on how to deal with the result of the referendum.
If the situation does not ease, Geywitz did not rule out talks with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening of the rental law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rental price freeze until 2029, limiting rent increases in tense housing markets and expanding the rental level.
I'll talk to the Attorney General and get this done as soon as possible.
The German government has also announced that it will not be able to pay the rent for the new building until the end of the year.
Hi, I was just going to order something and after a few days I realized I forgot the last step in the payment.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do you know when it 'll be back in stock ?
Or will it ever come again?
The following table shows the number of the following items in the table:
The coupon sounds great.
Then I will redeem it independently in the new order
Thank you for the quick clarification.
If the lamp is shipped in March, how long will it take to ship it?
I already cut my finger .
That is absolute insolence
At least 100 killed by tornadoes in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have swept across the United States.
In Kentucky alone, there could be over 100 dead.
The images from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
On Saturday night, tornadoes swept across the United States, wreaking havoc and possibly killing up to a hundred people.
The storms leave a 200-mile [200 km] swath of destruction, mostly in the state of Kentucky.
The governor of New Jersey, Andy Beshear, said after a visit to the disaster area that wherever the tornado had passed, everything was gone.
Houses, businesses, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It's hard to imagine that that's even possible.
He estimates that the death toll in the state of Kentucky alone could be as high as 100 people, and the official numbers are climbing every hour.
Hello, I just saw that she's sold out of the name store.
It's a shame, really.
Is it still being produced?
Or is it completely out of the picture?
Is it possible to order this display case from another country?
When will you be in touch?
If the delivery can't be made to my apartment, I have to cancel the order!
I understand, but can I order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the cart?
I had returned an article or a return via the contact form and wanted to ask if it had arrived or was being processed, as I had not yet received any confirmation.
Companies pay vaccine premiums and change advertising claims
While the Federal Government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and are offering their employees cash bonuses for vaccination.
The Commission has already taken a number of measures to combat the spread of the disease.
The conversion of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - following the German model - is also intended to increase the willingness to vaccinate against Corona.
He switched to a company he's been slandering.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously hasn't stuck to his old job and has gone looking for something else.
You can have it, too.
And that he didn't think you were good at the time, whatever.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please record the cancellation.
That's going to be legally relevant.
I'm going to take a screenshot.
Hello, I'm interested in the Boone dining table, white.
Is there a full-size one?
We have listed all Smeg kitchenware and related accessories in our online shop kitchenpoint.de.
We basically check the quality and completeness of your order.
Smeg's new fully automated coffee machine brings freshly ground coffee to your kitchen or office.
The simple and reduced design, the plastic surface in matte colours in combination with the matte-brushed stainless steel front make the new SMEG fully automatic coffee machine with milk foam a design object.
The reduced design allows all functions such as grind rate and water quantity, as well as the choice between espresso, Americano, Ristretto or a mild coffee with only four buttons.
Thanks to the steam plant, coffee-milk and milk-foam specialties can also be prepared.
Help for the first campaign
Boron to the grass!
I'm currently leading a group of four friends on the Over the Grapple Pass adventure and I'd like to seamlessly guide my heroes into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We 're playing DSA 5 .
The big arc is done, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts devised and now I'm about to write the opening adventure and stumble over my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are to take a cart of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
That's where the action is supposed to unfold.
A few miles from the village, the heroes are to ambush a group of goblins and lure them into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the ability to solve the confrontation in different ways: persuade, act, threaten, detect the danger early, whatever players can think of.
Group size: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 armed with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabers
When unnoticed, the goblins lurk the hero in a hollow and flank three left and right armed with bows the vehicle, while two with spears stop the vehicle.
If it comes to a fight and the heroes are defeated, I have two solutions.
The heroes are all found unconscious and subsequently cured by the son of the village schoolmaster, a half-elf.
The cart is gone, of course.
If defeat is inevitable, this half-elf and two of his minions will intervene and come to the hero's aid in the battle.
The cart's still there, everything's great.
How appropriate do you think Deus ex Machina is for Solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much for you to enter the adventure?
The group of goblins will play a crucial role later on, so it is not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect so many responses, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I'm sure I'll be taking in a lot of your ideas and I'm also now more confident in my narrative.
I took the lamp apart again.
And put it back together.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd still like to send her back.
Can you send the receipts for the return, so I can pack the lamp and bring it to the #PRS_ORG#.

Here was the bottom part, so the part with storage was damaged.
Will it be collected or just part of the storage?
I 'm annoyed by Sky Sports F1
Hello, dear F1 fans, over the season the quality on the German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to take a little air with this post.
First of all, the broadcast was interrupted today in the middle of the F2 race to allow the F1 preview to start on time.
Although the schedule was far behind the schedule due to the delayed start and the start accident, the final (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!) could still have been shown.
But it seems that for legal reasons, F1 has priority and therefore everything else has to be limited, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still, it's stupid, especially since Sky UK has put the race on late.
Nevertheless, a small compliment: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation of the serious accident well.
Then there was in F1 again ignorance of the rules with the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that you can change the tires under a red flag.
Although this situation had already occurred at Imola, Baku and Silverstone earlier this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen should be allowed to change tyres when there were corresponding radio messages on this subject to Hamilton.
Both Sky UK and RTL commentators knew immediately that Verstappen had this option.
I think that's the kind of basic rules you should know when you're commenting on F1 on a pay-TV channel.
It's not the first guess, either, what's possible or prescribed by the rules, both just have constant uncertainties about the rules.
I don't like Roos's commentary style, but it's a matter of taste.
But seriously, I like even Heiko Water from RTL better.
And then there are the constant silliness that makes them both look unprofessional, like ordering coffee from (also clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
The latter is the one who brings a lot of unease into the comment, which he does not seem to take seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising is simply taking over Sky, in the final round Sky is the only channel that goes into the advertising, as you can listen to F1TV because only the German soundtrack has to come out without commentary right after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF are doing this.
Also, these two stations do less advertising in the training than Sky, and that as free TV stations.
I am sure that Glock and Baumgartner are to be commended for their work, but that alone does not make me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of Sky Sport F1's program is also very poor and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language broadcaster to broadcast F1.
Ironically, except for the advertising, RTL is doing a better job with the four races they are allowed to broadcast.
Anyway, the great F1 season is much less fun than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.
I'd like to hear your opinion.
On this one: #PRS_ORG#- pendulum lights, brass and multicolored glass x 1
Hi, I have an item that was supposed to be delivered last week and still hasn't been delivered.
I've contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The first lady told me it's going to be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she's going to check and send an email and she never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12/19.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I'm asking for support.
Ventilator pumps are ideal for providing additional oxygen to an aquarium.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air levers.
We offer this series in three variants.
Look at the chart at the end of the quote.
There you can see the performance in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can run entire plants with them.
If you have a large aquarium, you can use pumps with two or more outlets so that you can connect more outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four outlets, depending on the model, but fan pumps are also suitable for accentuating the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (found in our shop) or with a decor that converts the air bubbles into a function.
This would be a treasure chest, a shell or something.
The MK series has a special sound-proof construction, ensuring low noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected to a vent or similar with an air hose 4/6 mm and it is ready to go.
The fan pump should be at or above the water level and installed outdoors.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a back-up valve should be placed between the two.
Just cut the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent, once the water would flow backwards, the water from the pool would flow through the pump...
If the fan pump is installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, as other air pumps are.
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packages that consume little energy
Even though we put the processing time here on eBay as 3 days, packaging is done daily and the packages are also picked up here daily.
If things go well on the road, it's very quick.
We just want to be a little bit more careful so that no one is upset because it took a little longer once.
It would be like, not everyone has understanding for all the employees, who also work in the shipping industry...of course, Corona does not stop here.
Please don't rate it too low just because the delivery is delayed, that's entirely the fault of the parcel service.
Of course, people like to complain about these services, although we're saying right now, they're fucking tough.
This is also very different from region to region.
Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Can you order the legs in bright here?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and host to space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV host and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the New Shepard rocket system from Blue Origin, the company owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The flight took off and landed in the western U.S. state of Texas.
Under the bright blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the newly-appointed astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back", said Bezos, dressed in a blue spacesuit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
With applause from friends, family members and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers climbed out and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were on the road for 10 minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 NASA astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after whom the Blue Origin rocket system is named, and the 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were the company's guests of honor, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much each of them paid for their tickets.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the brief flight.
He said he had to work hard on his assignments and do everything himself.
She just flew along, the 74-year-old said with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also spoke enthusiastically.
He would like to return to space again, the presenter said.
New Shepard is flying up to 100 kilometers
The New Shepard missile system is largely automated.
The capsule, which was separated from the rocket during the flight, reached an altitude of about 100 kilometers above the earth, temporarily with zero gravity, before the reusable object landed, slowed down by large parachutes.
The International Civil Aviation Organization and many other experts consider 100 kilometres above the earth to be the limit to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was Blue Origin's third manned spaceflight, the first in July, with Amazon founder Bezos himself on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former U.S. pilot, and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second, in October, was attended by 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and Blue Origin's deputy chief executive, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the good of humanity and without regard for the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and I find the subject itself quite exciting and I am not bothered by being in the laboratory (I have already completed the inorganic chemistry internship).
I also informed myself about career prospects before studying, but I also thought at the time that I definitely wanted to study until I got my doctorate and I will.
But I'm having doubts, especially about my career prospects.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc) you hear about super job opportunities and that the profession is totally sought after, on the other hand you hear about unemployed biologists and incredibly low-paid jobs.
So I 'd be really interested to know:
1) What are you currently working on?
2) Are you satisfied with your job/salary?
3) What did you study/ what did you do?
4) Would you do the whole thing again?
Thank you very much for your answers.
I'm really insecure right now and I'm thinking about dropping out of school and going into computer science in 2022.
If you have experience in this, please write to me.
Extra stress before holidays and holiday weekends
This topic came up with me last week.
I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why I'm putting a post on it now.
Not only before big holidays, like Christmas holidays, there is a lot of stress in our company.
It seems there's a pre-holiday plus the bridge days.
Because last week was the Ascension of Mary, which we in Switzerland call the Ascension.
On Friday, most people and businesses make a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So, last week was a long four-day weekend in the house.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
All these e-mails that had to be sent out before the train started, order here, order there, all *must* before the long weekend.
Because... yeah because?
Because "next week then" sounds like so much time and it can't be?
Or is it because people seriously want to do as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed out on Wednesday, but I was also very nervous.
What's with the self-hypnosis about holidays?
Why have holidays if we can't really enjoy them?
The stress was not from above, the colleagues were all independent of it.
My question is simple: are we the only ones who are like that, the Swiss?
Is that our Reformed evangelical way?
Or do you know that in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld looks forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld, 42, is looking forward to Christmas in her homeland of Thuringia - but has no presents yet.
"The beauty of it is that even if there is no snow in Erfurt, you can just drive to Ilmenau in the Thüringer Wald", said the actress and singer to Hit Radio FFH.
She'll be attending the festivities by baking and baking cookies with her son.
"I love this", said Catterfeld.
But until the days of the recess she has some things to do: "For the first time I have no gifts, I must finally get started".
NEKTON-Bio supports the smooth development of the mice and their feathers.
NEKTON-Bio contains all the vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 μg of biotin/kg which are essential for life.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of the risks in poultry farming are caused by poor nutrition alone.
Since the plumage is made up of protein-containing material, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet is a prerequisite for the formation of a perfect plumage.
For a proper metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A large proportion of the losses occurring during the mouse stage are due to a lack of or imbalance in protein intake and/or an insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
The composition of NEKTON-Bio explicitly takes into account and balances the unfavourable ratio of amino acids in most plant foods.
No other vitamin supplement should be given while taking NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is cold water soluble and can be easily administered via the drinking water or the soft food.
Thank you very much, I found it
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
GDR handmade model Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was in use in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railway ME Booklet 11/1968, used with tracks and parts see photos, function well, The E 95 series is a heavy freight train electric locomotive of the German Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which has been designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the narrow network, possibly the construction kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we have restored it to working order.
In 1924 the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that would be able to carry 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a travel speed of 45 km/h on this route.
The maximum speed was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG decided on the delivery of the mechanical part as a 1Co+Co1 locomotive with Tatzlager drive AEG, the Siemens Schuhckertwerke with the electric part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received the service numbers E 95 0106.
All of them survived the Second World War and found themselves on the territory of the future GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were sent to the Soviet Union as repairs.
They returned to Germany by November 1952.
The Reichsbahn-Reparationswerk Dessau was the place where all six locomotives were tested for workability.
In 1959, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were reworked, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts.
The E 04, E 44 and E 94 which were available in larger numbers were first preferred.
It was only when it became apparent that the number of processing operations could not be increased further on the E 94 that the E 95 was put in the spotlight of processing.
[4] Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway works.
You came to the Halle P. Railway Works in 1960.
They were used in their own timetable, mostly before coal trains from the Geisel valley in the direction of Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The problem with increasing age was the complicated control of the locomotives.
It was more often that gunners stuck to their guns during skirmishes.
Then the steward, who was always on this locomotive, had to unlock the gunner's gun with a hammer and a wooden peg.
Damage to the traction motors was frequent and led to months of locomotive failure.
Since there were enough new locomotives at the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of electric operation was not planned at the time, the Reichsbahn could do without old locomotives and most splittergattungen, so that the E 95 were taken out of service.
In addition, they argued that the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to keep electric locomotives in single-man operation, which would have caused a problem in train operation due to the difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the driver's cab.
After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were discontinued in mid-1969, they were followed by the E 95 01, which left service on 5 October 1970.
The proposed new designation 255 001 was therefore never used.
All the locomotives have been dismantled except for the E9502.
The E 95 02 was installed as a switch heating system at Halle Hauptbahnhof to replace the future museum locomotive E 77 10.
It took some time before the Reichsbahn officials were convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the first external work on the locomotive began with the aim of being able to present it at a vehicle show at RAW Dessau.
It was built in the late 1930s by the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-functional museum locomotive.
In 1986, the internal completion of the locomotive took place.
The locomotive is now on display in the DB Museum Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, the staff of the traditional community Bw Halle P have been working on the operational repair of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with new interior and exterior painting, whereby the transformers were checked and five drive motors are operational.
- The locomotives were used until 1945 on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the diverting side tracks, where they proved their worth due to their reliable drive and low maintenance.
In February 1945 the machines were transferred to Leipzig to the central German network.
The main area of activity was initially Silesia
Handmade model H0 in OVP, functional well, it is optical reworking on the locomotive in own work necessary, dusty, with game tracks, cellar smell !!!, very rare handmade model, very small production- possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packages may bear labels and traces of storage.
Yes, the F-parts are.
I got a bed from you.
However, there was a problem with one part.
The middle beam is held by two feet...unfortunately, they're too narrow and the beam can't be mounted on the feet.
What are we gonna do?
I can't make the bed.
The central beam is held by two feet, which unfortunately are faulty.
The centre beam does not fit into the intended bracket.
So I get new ones sent to me.
When are they going to be sent?
No, not flat.
These are, according to the assembly instructions the correct of the form, they were just too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
The main thing is that they serve their purpose.
They 're not flat with me .
Could you send this to me?
Hello #NAME#, do you want me to explain the problem again?
Residential fire with two minor injuries and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in an apartment building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage has been caused in the six-digit euro area, police said on Sunday.
The fire had apparently spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (Landkreis Landsberg am Lech).
Two residents were reportedly hospitalized on Sunday with mild smoke poisoning.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not believe it was arson.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigation.
It's gonna be a lot later than that.
And I have to pay for the shipping again
To dismantle fake news, biotech CEO releases photo of vaccine
Uğur Şahin posted a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on LinkedIn
Biotech CEO Uğur Şahin had not publicly commented on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur has posted a photo showing his coronavirus vaccination.
A friend's illness had motivated him to do so, Şahin said.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving a vaccine against the coronavirus.
There was false information on social media that I was not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine", Şahin wrote in a post on LinkedIn on Friday.
"For the past few months, friends have been urging me to post a picture of myself being vaccinated to counter these false rumors".
He has so far refused to do so because the communication should not revolve around him.
But a phone call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He's battling a severe COVID-19 illness and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin wrote.
He didn't ask why.
"However, the most common cause seems to be fear, often fuelled by misinformation and mistrust".
Fear is hard to combat with facts, sometimes it's better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the Internet, in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"I am not legally allowed to get the vaccine myself at this time", Şahin said at the time.
In Germany, priority should be given to vaccination.
The priorities have long since been removed, and the biotech boss has, according to his own account, been vaccinated three times.
Fire in a transmission plant: tens of thousands without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no electricity and in many cases no heating.
A fire had paralyzed a substation.
After a fire at a substation caused severe damage, tens of thousands of people in the Rhine-Sieg district of North Rhine-Westphalia were without electricity for about 24 hours.
The fire knocked out power to 41,000 affected residents in several communities on Friday night.
The utility Westnetz reported that numerous emergency generators were in operation on Saturday until the large-scale disruption was finally completely fixed late in the evening.
Firefighters and volunteers from the THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered school places for care and called for neighborhood help.
The operator thanked the victims for their patience and the helpers for their dedication.
We are well aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant constraints.
We also thank the municipalities concerned, the district, the fire brigades and THW for their tireless efforts", said Florian Witt, head of the Primary Technology Department, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The damage repair will take a few more days, he said, as the Western Network engineers were only able to restore some lines temporarily.
A technical defect caused the fire, according to the company.
The power is back on .
The fire that broke out on Friday at 7:15 p.m. severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switching system at the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation, according to Westnetz.
Extensive cleaning and repair work is required.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level was created.
With this bypass, the power's back on.
As of Saturday at 6 p.m., over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth had their electricity back on.
Another 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid had been gradually added from 9.30 pm.
The last of the affected ones had no electricity since 11:15.
More than 80 installers from Westnetz and partner companies were involved.
Authorities had also called for neighborhood assistance after the installation of emergency power for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
"It is important now that citizens take care of elderly or single people in their neighbourhood and report to the local fire station if help is needed", explained Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
The focus of the installation and operation of emergency power units was on the residents of old people's homes.
In addition, according to authorities, temporary care spaces in schools were set up for those who could not provide for themselves or who needed electricity-dependent medical equipment or who were dependent on medical care.
Good afternoon.
Unfortunately, the blanket is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy these from you and pay in euros?
It's the #PRS_ORG# day blanket in blue and green.
I hope you have a nice day too and please stay healthy ♡
I can't mount this on the table top, though.
It is a custom #NAME#.
There are three ways to do this.
We wanted the ones with tabletops the size of #NUMBER#
We have a diameter of 155 cm.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, however I can't slide these together and shorten them.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise, I would have to send it back, since it is not fit for purpose otherwise.
I'd be happy to hear back.
This is really easier!
Then let's do it this way!
Can you email me the return slip?
The repair is now complete.
I tried this before the chat.
Before I bought it, I hadn't restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
You want me to do that now?
I find such a low credit almost insolent.
We don't agree with that.
The Nordic combination: combiner Riiber wins
The German Nordic combiners Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid have sprinted to the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
The duo had to give up once again to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started with a big lead after ski jumping into the loop.
Return the order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we both have rebuilt and use version 4.5...
It could be that you have heard about the problem before.
I bought a book directly from my #PRS_ORG#, it seems to be on it too.
As soon as I open it, it says, "Ups!"
This document could not be opened.
If the file is in error, please contact customer service.
As far as I can tell, it's a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I have to work sometimes too!
To ensure that the paint is evenly applied and clean, you should clean the components from dust, grease, and fingerprints with a little soapy water, rinse with clear water, and dry them off.
Before you apply the paint for the first time, it is advisable to practice two or three strokes.
You can do this on the inside of the components, which will not be visible later, or on a yogurt cup.
The first stroke on the part
Pull the brush evenly, line by line.
Slight overlapping of the layers of paint later ensures a uniform surface.
Avoid quick brushing back and forth.
This creates surfaces that seem unrealistic.
A model is not a fence.
Start with the light colors.
The dark ones might shine through later.
Metallic tones and metallic colors come at the very end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unsightly metallic glands may develop when they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you repair them.
The models achieve their original look through the decals or decals.
From the insignia of a plane to the names of ships to the decals and license plates of car models, decals give the model its finishing touch.
Place the decals in the correct order while the components are still within easy reach.
An aircraft cockpit can be glued or glued more easily before it is fitted to the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tools, such as shears, tweezers, and toothpicks, is the time, patience, and steady hand needed to glue.
Cut out each decal you need and set it straight.
Decals are also called water-slide pictures because you briefly soak their backs with water until the supporting paper becomes dark from the moisture.
Then you just slide the picture a little bit off the paper and put the piece on the appropriate spot on the model (which you also moistened before).
While holding the decal on the model with a tool, pull the backing paper away from the side.
Note: Always check the image for the correct position before you slide it off the paper completely, so that it does not stick to your finger, wrinkle or even tear.
Use a household cloth to drain off excess water.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years of age
I can only open a book for a short time, and as soon as I look for something else, I don't read the book anymore, and I have to log out and log in and reload the book and find my way to where I read it.
I have already communicated with you on Saturday.
Can I get this by email?
All three of them?
Because the lamp came to me in three separate packages
Okay, thank you very much.
I'll buy from somewhere else as soon as I get my money back.
But can I get it back without any problems?
Childcare in a car / What is an 'insurance case'?
Hey, you guys.
We've been in child-rearing treatment for some time, but now when it comes to settling with the car, it's all of a sudden crossed.
In order:
We had applied for the child support in advance at the car park and got the promise of 3 tries.
The experiments were not limited in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and delivery and was settled with the PKV.
Some time later, we tried to have a second child, and we made two unsuccessful attempts, but they were not counted against the car.
We applied again to the PKV for the costs and received three more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we have done more than promised, logically the most expensive ones are to be paid by PKV) we submitted the invoices to PKV and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), PKV only wants to pay back 3 attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the other 2 attempts of the first promise are lost.
The second child wish was a new insurance case.
The AGB, however, states that "the insurance case begins with the cure, it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists".
The questions for the experts in the round are:
* Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 trials are reimbursed) or us (there are 5 trials to be reimbursed)?
* Should the PKV have told us in the promises that with a birth the further attempts will fail?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (caused by closed fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here could give their opinion.
Thank you for your help.
Can you please email me the three options and tell me the best way to reach them again?
I'll be right with you.
We're not ordering anything from them anymore.
If you add up the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they've obviously lost a good customer.
You can tell your manager that.
That's not competitive.
Yesterday my colleague told me that the refund was arranged and now you tell me that I have to send the thing back.
I can 't help it if the dresser comes to me in a state of confusion .
Please see the screenshot of what the colleague wrote.
It says very clearly that the refund was initiated and I still haven't received a refund via #PRS_ORG#
You can tell your manager that you've lost two regulars.
My friend also used his account to order various pieces of furniture for our apartment.
We're not gonna do that anymore.
No, the defect didn't occur until a few months later.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they can't sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, the warranty is 24 months.
No, I can't get another type of packaging.
I'll be able to take the cabinet down and put it at the disposal of the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your #PRS_ORG# series
These products are advertised with additional purchasing stools, but unfortunately we cannot find these with you.
Can they help?
This week's topic: The best low-budget films
What exactly constitutes a low-budget film is not defined by any general definition with exact budget limits.
Here's what Wikipedia has to say about it:
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
The Internet is full of lists of low-budget films, such as Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting people in this category?
What is it that excites you?
And what might you not like at all?
I'm a very good customer of yours, I've already furnished two apartments with your furniture.
I was trying to get the best price on Odelle's gray leather sofa.
The delivery time has been extended once again, is it reliable?
Thank you very much .
With warm greetings
There's no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position... I'll give up soon because it just doesn't work here.
Hey there.
'Half-winning' against Belarus comes at a high cost to the EU
The EU can declare a "half-victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime, according to political expert Raphael Bossong.
The cost is very high and has meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees on Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not solved the confrontation in a sustainable way, the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP) said.
This state of affairs - Belarus is not giving up easily, but the EU feels that it is winning - will probably continue for a while.
The EU has a long-standing policy of respecting human rights and the rule of law.
There seems to be an "increasing normalisation of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
The EU as a whole has not been able to act decisively against this, at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development also undermines the cohesion of the Union.
"It cannot be enforced when a Member State decides to do its own thing", as is the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU border agency Frontex access to its border.
The EU is also paying a further price for its border policy with Belarus, Bossong said, adding that agreement on the principles of asylum policy is being made more difficult by the strengthening of the "border, border, border" line.
Another attempt to cross the border
According to Polish border guards, migrants have meanwhile again tried to cross into Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested overnight and brought back to the border, a spokeswoman for the authority said on Sunday.
The Polish officials were stoned by the migrants near the town of Czeremsza.
According to reports, one soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor.
In total, Border Patrol recorded 52 attempted border crossings in 24 hours.
By Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had broken through the border checkpoints.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or tried to cross the Belarus-EU border in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko of luring them to the EU with the prospect of entry as a power in Minsk.
Poland and Lithuania have sealed off border sections, according to press reports.
The EU has sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines flying migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners travelled to people's countries of origin to prevent people from leaving.
The most effective element of the EU's response was to put pressure on the airlines, Bossong said.
"The EU has put its market power on the line and demonstrated its determination to operate with harsh restraints and extraterritorial sanctions".
The EU's new strategy for the EU's external relations is based on the principles of the Lisbon strategy.
The Belarusian society is not used to the fact that the security apparatus regularly smuggles thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula One final
Max Verstappen, according to Mercedes, has committed two rule violations during the race.
After the controversial Formula 1 final in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has filed an appeal.
The Silver Arrows are suspecting two fouls in the final Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to an alleged infraction by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the final safety car phase when he allegedly overtakes.
A second objection was lodged against the final score.
Mercedes believes the protocol was not followed properly.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and had won his first Formula One title.
The manoeuvre came shortly after the end of a safety car phase, in which the Dutchman had overtaken cars ahead of him.
I'll look into it.
I'll talk to the bank and get back to you.
Thank you for your support.
Free entry for members: Europa-Park is organising the SC-Freiburg Fantag
The Europa-Park, which gives its name to the Europa-Park Stadion of the Sport Club Freiburg, has invited Fantag to SC Freiburg.
According to the park, members and permanent ticket holders of the Breisgau sports club and members of the fan community were allowed to visit Europa-Park for free on that day.
Plus, there were coupons for drinks and sausage.
The rollercoasters were shining red and white through the jerseys that day.
"Foxes, Ed Euromaus, and many red-and-white balloons provided the perfect backdrop", says the park.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, there has been cooperation between the Bundesliga club and the amusement park in Rust, 40 kilometres north of Freiburg.
The first SC Freiburg Fantag in Europa Park once again showed how well the partnership fits.
Seeing the radiant fans having fun together on the roller coaster confirms this", says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is it €#NUMBER# and not like the original €1699?

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Home"
As part of the "LiteraTour Nord" reading series, author Judith Hermann read from her latest novel "Daheim" on Friday in the sold-out Blue Note and also acted as a moderator.
Divorced, she lives in a house on the coast, and she listens attentively to the noises of her door at night.
I left the contact form for an article return yesterday, but I didn't get an email confirmation or anything.
I would like to ask whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has time for your lame-ass chat and mis-delivered cheap Chinese goods.
Your mistake, which you'll correct and not all of our household.
Contact Mrs #NAME#. She is a member of the European Parliament.
I can't chat with them every day
We chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# will receive an email with a 60 euro coupon, a new order for the #PRS_ORG# nightstand and a return label.
That e-mail didn't come in until now.
The package is scheduled to be delivered to PRS_ORG today.

Sorry, but just because he says he's not anti-Semitic doesn't mean anything.
It's like when a guy says he doesn't have anything against foreigners.
Your i will admit it both not.
But Kollegah is constantly reproducing some kind of anti-Semitic message.
If you want to distance yourself, you should just let it go.
Yeah, wow, then you're just as unimportant as your colleague.
Anyone who seriously questions the basic principles of evolution is simply out of his mind.
I'm the reason a god started this whole thing.
But once you're a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and science is just full of nonsense.
And by that you are an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously as colleague
To obtain an optimal field of vision, the lens should be placed as close as possible to the eye.
The specially designed aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifier practically record- and color-error-free all the way to the edge zone.
Often magnifying glasses are marked with magnification information.
However, these data are only valid for precisely defined conditions, which are rarely the same as the conditions of use.
To make the most of your magnifying glass, please refer to the instructions in the "Technical Data" table (see package leaflet).
Light reflections are produced on the lens surfaces of all optical devices, including impact lenses.
The use of anti-reflective coating will significantly reduce these reflections.
When optimum conditions are met - lens close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
For more information, see the accompanying instructions for use (available in English and German).
The first is the 'L' of the first type, which is the 'L' of the second type.
Whether as a reading aid for the road or simply for everyday trifles, the Zeiss VisuCard is the ideal helper, because its handy format allows it to be carried anywhere.
And their hard coating makes them resilient to the particular strains of old age.
Each magnifying glass is accompanied by a cheque card case for storage and safe transport.
They're bidding on these parts that you see in the pictures or under "What are you bidding on?"

#PRS_ORG# I will do very nice and good service, although it took you to get to a person, you were great
Hello, dear PRS team
I've already reached out to you under the customer contact number #PHONENUMBER#.
Yes, but it was said before.
They can't deliver from England because of #PRS_ORG#.
In the municipality of Krembz, women are looking for Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has experienced some of the most bizarre situations in the sale of tin.
One man even went home without his wife because they could not agree on a plan.
He plants well over 2,000 plants a year.
The 56-year-old has already experienced many curious situations.
He says that's what makes the Christmas season always a little fun.
What about the coupon?
Otherwise I'm out as a customer?!
At least I got a defective delivery and now I'm paying full price for it.
Then I will judge that too!
We need not argue here about the better dish, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both are made of meat that is grilled on a spinning skewer.
And that's why they both have their names.
In German, the equivalent might be something like "Dreher", which is not that delicious.
Problems with the fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic
We've had a new fiber-optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I'm having trouble setting up a stable Wi-Fi network.
Before I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and I used Devolo DLan, which except for a few failures, received and sent 50 Mbit without any problems.
The new fiber-optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module connected to the FritzBox receives them.
However, the full 500 no longer reaches the other DLan module, which is emitting the Wi-Fi, but the further I go with the module in the house, the less it reaches (so I use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. spaces away from the other module).
As a result, the Internet with the new fibre connection is now even slower than before (~45 Mbit) on the first floor.
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were similarly large losses.
Can someone explain to me why fiber optic is losing so much internet speed over the power line?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely expensive to install LAN cables in the house.
I'm really desperate, which is why I've set up an account here.
That is why I would be all the more pleased to hear an answer.
When it is time to change the current account
Whoever thought that the current accounts would be quiet now, is deceived.
While many banks have used the autumn to use all sorts of tricks to get their customers to confirm the past increases in fees, the exemptions for negative interest rates continue to fall.
For example, Deutsche Bank was considered relatively generous for a long time with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she's cut the free rental in half and for the day's pay, she's even quadrupled it.
In a first step, the limit was lowered for Postbank customers only - to EUR 50 000 for current and investment accounts and to EUR 25 000 for overnight accounts.
However, these lower exemptions now apply to the whole of Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed on request.
This applies not only to new contracts but also to 'new individual agreements with existing customers'.
Commerzbank had already previously fallen to a limit of EUR 50 000, which is still valid, as was the case with ING Germany.
The bank, which is popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the amount of the free credit in two stages, first to EUR 50 000 and now to EUR 25 000.
More than 100 banks now have a free transfer of 25,000 euros or less, according to figures from the Internet portal Verivox.
The first is the possibility of a new law, which would allow the consumer to be able to obtain a new contract for the sale of goods and services.
There is already a discussion in the banks about whether institutions should perhaps set aside funds - in the event that the higher authorities declare negative interest rates inadmissible in principle and have to repay many millions to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston employs an entire army of beauty
She's officially the top of Hollywood.
But their lives are like a roller coaster.
Jennifer Aniston, 52, was named the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine The Hollywood Reporter.
For her, who made headlines in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
Their appearance is taken care of by an army of assistants, stylists, and trainers.
After all, Aniston says, she gets one chip a day (yes, read correctly: a SINGLE chip from the bag).
That she's still won the hearts of both female and male fans is a miracle.
Maybe because she's just unlucky with luck and still looking for the great love.
And crossed the baby-wanting off the list.
Before, she was constantly asked when she was going to become a mother.
It hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what's wrong with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
Keep hoping that success and fame will make you happy too.
The undignified end of a career: the Reichsbürger must resign
Kimi Räikkönen's farewell from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight tyre contact, Räikkönen had to drop his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after less than half the race distance.
It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ending his career in the motorsport king class.
His wife Minttu and two children also travelled to the United Arab Emirates to say goodbye.
Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in a Ferrari.
He won 21 Grand Prix, started 18 times from pole and was on the podium 103 times.
The German team won the World Cup for the 60th time .
The mark of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bobsledder.
"I've done the math, I'd have to win nine and a half races a season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026", said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who won two races in two days at Winterberg.
First, he fought off the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths on Saturday, in which he drove from rank three to one.
Then he changed the material setting a little bit, and on Sunday he drove a bigger 0.30-second head start.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he was ahead of the Brit Brad Hall.
The third place was taken by Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We took a bigger risk today and we were rewarded", said Friedrich, who also claimed his 22nd win in a row.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who is riding for Stuttgart, came in fifth place after placing second earlier.
Christoph Hafer of BC Bad Feilnbach finished eighth in the first race after finishing fourth.
"If I knew what he did differently, I would do it the same way", Lochner said.
Nolte with home victory - podium for Jamanka
In the women's division, Laura Nolte took home her third win of the season in the two-woman bobsled.
After only finishing fourth in the monobob the day before, she raced to the world cup victory with Anschieber Deborah Levi in the German triple victory on Sunday.
Two-time Olympic bob champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia came in second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
She earned her first podium spot this winter, in addition to her Olympic qualification.
The Wiesbader Kim Kalicki finished with Leonie Fiebig in third place.
I thought it was super cool, first podium in the World Cup, I'm super happy that Mariama is taking me.
I'm super happy with the development.
The Commission has already taken a number of measures to improve the quality of the air transport services provided by the Member States.
Jamanka was a bit annoyed by the not-so-flawless driving, but said: "It's going in the right direction".
I already had the blanket in the shopping basket and could buy it now!
What do you want me to do?
I didn't get it, so I can't cash it in, so I finally asked around.
Because of Corona, I had a different problem last year and never had time for it.
And now it's been said that it's expired, which makes me very angry.
Look in the chat it was about the Asare bench.
I'd like to return it and order it again, since it's just been reduced.
Why is the shipment not started until March 16th?
There was nothing about such a long delivery time on your website.
No , not until I 've figured it out . There 's a special box with the message .
Picked up by your colleague yesterday.
Why It Is a Problem Today
I also sent you pictures of the wrong-delivered goods.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged one.
And not cancel the whole order.
Just this day, just this week, just until XY...
Hello, dear awesome girls and girls and women,
I have some things I just want to write and maybe one or the other will do so...
I'm 24, I'm a full-time student and a dog mom -- except that my dog doesn't bark or go to kindergarten, he's basically one of my kids.
My boyfriend (we've been together for 6 years) is sick, got a second degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I went to see him because I have emotional needs and because I want to see him and feel him, we hugged a lot and it was nice.
I helped him take a shower because his hand is tied up in the bandage .
He's cold and we don't see each other as often as we used to, which makes me very uncomfortable with my need for affection and love.
My puppy just had a stomachache, I cooked for him and now he's lying in his cuddly blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and caressing for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just been away for a month.
Now we're all assigned housework, which we share, of course.
But cooking is a lot of work for me right now...
My PTSD is well under control, I'm halfway through therapy and getting better.
Not good, but I'm doing fine, and I'm almost symptom-free.
My university is demanding a lot (for me), tomorrow at 3 pm I have a written test for which I have not done anything and the day after tomorrow anatomy class for which I should at least prepare a little.
And next week, I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what happens next is on my calendar and not in my head because there's no room.
So my week goes like this: I only have until the day after tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But after that, you're still going through it?
Just until the birthday.
Just until the holidays.
Just until the weekend.
Just until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed right now that I need this mental clue, because otherwise I'm gonna get it.
I feel guilty and chaotic, but I can't do it any other way.
Is that how you feel?
Honestly, I'm just so grateful that I don't have to work.
I'm so grateful, I can't even begin to put it into words.
I don't know if I would have survived my kptbs.
I think it has something to do with the mental load of women, and that's why I thought I'd find some fellow sufferers here...
I'm sure you'll have a restful evening, the week is almost over!
I got my order today. Unfortunately, the whole color is different, plus the surface is scratched and the table leg has a print.
When the first shipment was made, the color was exactly as it was on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we switch tables now, I get a different color, right?
The cancellation email was sent on December 26th.
The rest of you, twice.
But it was not confirmed.
In school, I noticed that many religious teachers do not believe in God, and they view it as just another subject, like math or geography.
It was always a little strange for me, maybe because I was raised as a Christian and I always believed in it.
How do you feel about that?
You may also be able to tell about workmates or fellow students who have different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional, and it makes sense to separate.
There is a curriculum and so on.
But it would just be weird to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in relativity.
What, then, is the point of wanting to teach religion if you do not believe it?
Preserve the culture or something?
Hope your question isn't too personal.
Can't it be changed or not? Please write in English, I understand that too
It's been a long time, I'd be careful.
It's fine, thank you.
I expect to hear back from you in due course, no later than the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film search help please
Hello, people.
I 'm looking for a film from my childhood .
I think it was a teen film.
In the film, there are two time axes (or parallel worlds).
The first is the modern (real) world.
Secondly, the past (or the realm of the dead) is not entirely certain.
Since I can't describe it any more precisely, in the real world, there's a young woman.
And in the land of the dead, a young soldier.
For some reason, the paths cross and an action is created.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm so that she can live on her own, I mean.
I believe the passage is the soldier's grave.
In the end, I think both soldiers will fight each other.
If that's what you mean, I'm grateful for any answers.
Our little girl has been sleeping on her stomach since week one.
Fast forward , still alive .
You just relax.
A kid like that can take a lot more than you think.
Make sure everything's in order around it, no cuddling, go in and look more often, but no minutes of surveillance.
It's driving you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
I like the mattress.
No pillows.
Our sister and I didn't have a sleeping bag, but we always had a blanket.
Watch your child while he sleeps.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it stand up from the belly?
Or is it facing forward directly into the mattress?
You can tell if everything's all right.
We all grew up, too, and when my husband was born, it was common practice to put the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
We're already regular customers and have bought many items.
But why are you only offering me 20 euros?
Hi, I wrote to a colleague of yours yesterday and I haven't heard back.
It's about my closet that arrived the day before yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer doesn't fit in the closet.
I'm asking you to contact me as soon as possible.
The closet is currently unusable.
Let me get this straight.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV, too.
It's just that the politics of this station have become a little bit of a mess.
Almost every format is sponsored (okay), but then still going on a big begging tour.
It was said that you were an "independent" Internet broadcaster.
Arno: "We don't want to be a walking pillar of litmus".
What are you now?
A 0815 ad network trying to get its Billo joke to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's and Don'ts.
Which, of course, apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
They can keep insulting people.
A Krogman who lacks empathy and uses the rented rooms to make ash at the expense of the action.
How can you be okay with all this?
I love it when you like it. I hate it.
I'm calling in a recall because my wooden table was delivered defective.
Breaking the body by civilized delivery of the #PRS_ORG#.
Whether it's for a tummy ache or just for cuddling, my little warm friend has many uses.
Cherry kernel pillows are a traditional home remedy for beneficial thermal applications, as cherry kernels are very good at absorbing heat and releasing it in a measured way.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft cover makes the application especially pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even if they are not doing so well.
The cherry kernel cushion with a shelter is only suitable as a heat source for the following applications:
Before heating the pillow, check for any unusual odour, stains or burns and, if present, dispose of immediately.
Please remove the inner pillow from the frame for warming up.
Heat in the microwave at a maximum of 300 Watt for a maximum of 2 minutes (please refer to the microwave manufacturer's specifications).
After heating, shake the heat evenly in the pillow.
Then place the inner cushion back into the frame.
A slight moisture may be produced on the surface during the initial heating, but this will disappear after repeated application.
Be sure to follow the heating instructions, as prolonged heating times or higher power can cause damage (danger of ignition and combustion!).
Before heating the cushion in the microwave, check that the manufacturer's instructions allow heating of the grain products.
After the heated inner pillow has been placed back in the frame, please check the temperature of the pillow for baby-friendliness (max. 43 °C) at the elbow of your arm!
Do not use the pillow in patients with acute and chronic inflammatory or febrile illnesses, circulatory problems, fresh haematoids, bruises and open wounds, or in patients with reduced pain sensation.
If you have any skin, heart, vein, diabetes or tumour disease, or if you are pregnant, please consult your doctor before using this medicine.
If seams have opened and loose kernels have formed, dispose of the product and the loose kernels immediately and keep them out of the reach of children.
If the product is used in infants under 1 year of age, the child' s temperature should be monitored regularly during use to avoid overheating.
All serious incidents related to the product shall be reported to the manufacturer and to the competent authority of the country where the user is established.
The cover is removable and washable in a machine at 30 °C.
Please note the care symbols on the product.
Darmstadt after the second round - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the football Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working out of the table basement.
Ingolstadt doesn't have a third coach.
Jubilant in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hanover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed one under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery dead?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power supply.
I bought this new about five months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the power supply alone would be enough to get the operation going.
Bad signal, battery's dead, and the laptop won't start even with a power plug.
I took out the battery, but it's still not working.
You got any ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop on the grid?
Is there anything else broken?
Thank you for your help.
I want the delivery of the PRS_ORG# to the room.
How do I book this?
I'm interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
I don't know how high the seat is...
You've been on tour a lot, and you still bring a lot of gear?
With the Everyday V2 backpack from Peak Design, no problem!
20 litres of capacity can also easily swallow larger photographic equipment which can be safely stowed using the padded FlexFold parts.
And the other everyday objects you need, thanks to the practical accesses in the customizable interior, remain well organized and separable from the photographic equipment.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design is quite literally in itself - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing instant access to photographic equipment.
This works in two ways: one is conventional, via the lid, which can be closed with the MagLatch locking system, a brilliantly thought out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself in the Messenger bags.
The locking flap contains a metal lock hook with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has designed different 'filling racks': there are 4 anchor bars, securely fastened, into which the closing hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is full, just take the top bar, it's more empty, a lower one.
The valve closure and hook are also magnetic.
This also allows the backpack to be closed securely without the hook being tightened.
The second possibility also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday backpack from other photo backpacks: in addition to the lid flap, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the main disadvantage of conventional top-down backpacks - you no longer have to dig through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly increases the everyday usefulness of the backpack, not only when you take your photography equipment with you, but also when you take everyday items or luggage with you.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can configure the interior individually (more on this below) and thus store them separately without any problems - and also access them independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side in front of your body to access, for example, the camera equipment in the main right compartment, while the everyday items remain safely in the left half of the backpack and do not get in the way.
Convenient, easily adjustable supporting straps help to do this.
And because the backpack's outer shell is also made entirely from 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents will stay dry even if it's going to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I waited in vain for the email from your support.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday confirming the commissioning of the
Contact announced by the dispatcher to pick up the wrong table.
I haven't received any messages yet.
I request immediate action.
I'm already writing with the third support person, and I've gotten no further than a promise to get a confirmation email.
This is the return of the wrongly delivered custom #NAME#
Is there any way to know when the cabinet could be delivered?
Keeping him like this is not an option for me...
It's working.
Thank you very much for your help.
I wish you a good evening
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was made on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered.
Please call me
If you renew my voucher, I'll place a larger order, but at least I kept the damaged piece of furniture and didn't send it back.
And that the past year went differently than I thought I could not predict and I just could not redeem it in time and clear it.
But I'm the one who's been hurt, and I'm not gonna accept that.
Rotinger brake discs are designed to meet the needs of the dynamic driver, who appreciates reliability and safety when braking even in difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made of cast iron and then machined (drilled and cut).
All tinted panes are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics specific to certain panes and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special manufacturing programme is drawn up, which is based on the balancing of the panel according to the characteristics of the original assembly.
The tinted discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
Additional holes created increase the efficiency of cooling the disc, with the inserts improving the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
The aesthetic qualities of our tinted windows emphasize the character of each car by giving it an attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man on the south fork of the American River discovered glowing chunks in the water.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly, sparking the so-called California Gold Rush of 1949.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest-growing and most prosperous cities in the country.
Areas were cleared, tents were set up, and saloons and hotels were established almost overnight.
Everyone wanted a share of the country's wealth.
For many, it was Coloma or Bust!
In this game, you are a pioneer, seeking wealth in the West and making a name for yourself.
You'll be searching for gold, recruiting workers, raising horses and building businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding river channels and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outdo your fellow pioneers to keep from going bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many ways to win.
You simultaneously choose your actions, you have to manage your resources and build a tableau that works more and more for you (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, to get extra action or to bend rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can fine-tune and develop your own unique style of play.
Coloma takes place over a three-year period from 1848 (the year gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma is five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the game map where they can perform actions.
Then their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a site has the most pioneers, it gets a lockdown!
This disables the one half of the site -- reducing the potential actions there.
Players then take turns performing actions such as gaining resources, moving carts, setting up tents, exploring rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning revolver heroes.
When all the actions are completed, the Pioneers will return.
The driver rotates to a new location at the start of each round, changing the available actions.
This continues until the advertiser has moved five times, covering each location once, and the year is over.
There's a shootout in which players must defend Coloma from an onslaught of angry bandits.
If players have contributed enough gun heroes and outnumber the bandits, they will receive rewards.
But if they fail, they get lower rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final score is made.
The player with the most victory points wins!

Why Children are not Tyrants by Doku, ARD Media Library
CW mental violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary popped up on my Twitter timeline today, and I looked it up right away.
>Pediatric psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a frequent guest on talk shows and lectures throughout Europe.
His book Why Our Children Become Tyrants (2008) sparked a heated debate on parenting.
Former patients and guardians are now making serious accusations against him.
Please take care of yourselves, this movie is hard to bear.
And I'm very grateful that many people are now thinking and acting differently.
We, the parents and other responsible persons, must never, never, never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, and ever, ever, and ever, and ever, and ever, and ever, and ever, and

Holetschek: Countries to discuss the abolition of the test requirement for triple vaccination
The health ministers of the countries want to decide on the elimination of the mandatory test for triple vaccination at their next meeting.
"We need to clarify quickly whether and when the test requirement for those who have been vaccinated three times can be waived", Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Conference of Health Ministers, told Bild am Sonntag.
The elimination of 2G plus for those who have been vaccinated three times is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional incentive for vaccination", Holetschek said.
The German Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) said that he would make a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference on Tuesday.
So I want to send the lamp back
What's the best way to do that?
Hi, I like the #PRS_ORG# chair very much, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can't do any more shopping on my #PRS_ORG.
Whoa, there's been a mistake.
Shopping is done on the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I've updated the account information.
What could be the reason?
What you describe is called awareness, meaning sensory perception under general anesthesia.
These occur at a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
The most common is hearing sounds, rarely seeing images, and very rarely feeling pain.
The most important aspect of this is that caesarean sections are operations that involve an increased level of awareness, since the child is protected from very deep anaesthesia until the delivery.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned at the anesthesia interview.
Certain anaesthetic procedures such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
EDIT: Hi everyone, this comment of mine correctly describes Awareness, but by definition, it didn't.
I misread your comment.
But the chair is broken.
The 20 euros won't help us either.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be to take back the defective chair.
This is not only a legal requirement but also a standard in the e-commerce sector.
Please check again if you can at least take back the defective chair.
We'll sell the second chair privately.
We're losing a lot of money.
I already sent you an e-mail, which you didn't answer.
The question again.
The order and the invoice say that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The carrier is company #NAME#.
I just called them.
I was told they only deliver to the front door because of #PRS_ORG.
Is that so?
If so, I'll have to cancel the order because I don't know anyone who can carry my heavy furniture up to the first floor.
I'm not getting any calls?
I had formulated a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle died at the age of 97
He has made a name for himself as a theatre critic and as an intendant.
Later, he wrote a monumental history of the theater.
On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There's the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An Old Man Getting Older".
The shocking diary of a slow farewell to the world, which the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle has kept until April 2021.
And then, in the middle of the reading, the news comes that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book is, "I'm here to give thanks for a lifetime".
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common is the European pallet, a standardised wooden pallet used as a load carrier, particularly in the European Union.
They are certified by the European Palette Association EPAL
In 2020, according to data from Statistics Austria, more than 10 million pallets were produced in Austria.
The production value was well over 79 million euros.
The number of pallets imported into Austria each year is not collected
New York is the first MLS championship
New York City FC has won the title in Major League Soccer for the first time.
After going 1-1 in the regular season against the Portland Timbers, the Eastern Conference team won the final in penalty shootouts, 4-2.
In the Eastern Conference finals, New York had defeated Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen tips and tricks
I had a lot of great tips here a week ago for the perfect goulash.
It was at Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and butterzart!
So thanks again for that .
Now I've got the taste and I want to cook the first time to New Year's Eve rouladen.
Tomorrow I'm going to start a cattle fund.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I do not have an oven, but only a large pot.
What's the next move?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not so good anymore, but I'm getting there.
I'm talking about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was informed by e-mail on 18.01 that the refund had been made.
But until today, I haven't received the money.
Would you check there, please?
Where there are still Christmas roasts in the Lübeck room
For many people, the goose or the duck is as much a part of Christmas as the pine tree and the presents.
You haven't gotten a bird yet?
Now we're running out of time.
We'll tell you where you can get a roast at the Lübeck Room.
The "drive" of a tube end stage contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These characteristics are perfectly represented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
The VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controllers allow you to set the desired volume and the noise content of your sounds.
Furthermore, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL control which allows the sound level to be reduced without altering the gain and distortion.
It has already been said above that the POWER LEVEL control can even provide a power reserve if the noise is unreasonably loud.
The POWER LEVEL controller allows the full potential of the VT+ series to be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal is processed by a box simulation, so that even if you use a headset or if you record directly, you get an eminently "acoustic" sound impression.
The AUX socket can be connected to a CD or MP3 player so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - you don't need a separate voice.
If you also buy a VFS5 foot button, you can also call up the sounds conveniently by walking, turn the effect blocks on/off and "tap" the tempo of the compatible effects.
This is actually essential for live operations.
With its new power packages, VOX is taking another step into the future!
I've seen it in others.
Is there any way to send the lamp back to you?
Because it's too low for a dining room table?
So I'd like to send them back.
Can you help me with this?
And the dresser?
Will we get an update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If it's not possible, I'd be happy with a discount or a coupon.
I might be able to find a buyer for the furniture.
Just over 1,000 euros for goods I don't need is a bit much.
I just got my delivery and I was wondering if screws were part of the delivery.
I would like to attach the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) to the designated hook.
That's not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time was not worth it.
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in nuclear deal negotiations
The negotiations on the revival of the international nuclear agreement are progressing, according to Iran.
"Both sides are close to agreeing on the issues that should be on the agenda", Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told the IRNA news agency on Sunday.
The Commission's proposal is to be accompanied by a report on the implementation of the new rules on the protection of the environment.
The agreement is designed to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.
The Commission has also been asked to provide a report on the implementation of the agreement.
The negotiations will be attended by negotiators from Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France and Russia.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now the state with the highest corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in Germany.
The only German state to have a value above 1000 is the Netherlands.
Thuringia was the only federal state to exceed the 1,000 mark in the coronavirus incidence on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day value of 1,025 new infections per 100,000 people.
In Saxony, which had last consistently had the highest incidence in Germany, the figure was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had dropped slightly but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2,242 new cases of Sars-CoV-2 virus infection and 16 additional deaths related to infection were reported in one day.
200 severe COVID-19 patients were treated in intensive care units in hospitals on Sunday.
There may be delays in reporting on weekends.
And the health authorities have been overworked for weeks and are barely keeping up with the new cases.
I can understand that.
Since the delivery is not until the beginning of March, it may be possible by then.
I have to print this and put it on the package and send it to the post office, right?
I don't have to click/specify/fill in anything else here?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, which is why I'm writing to you.
I'd like to take care of the return shipment at my own expense.
8 euros for returns is a bit of a sham in my eyes.
It 's time for a change
I am here in the plenary chamber in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
Why the post here?
If you look at the activity of the Bundestag in the past months, one thing is clear: it does not exist.
We've entered a winter winter and extended the summer hole to a few months.
What's the problem?
Yeah, what was it?
It is not a question of the Commission's ability to act, but of the fact that it is not able to act.
In recent days, it has become increasingly clear that many people here are really still against the Bundestag.
What we need to change
At this point, the question is asked of the community around the Bundestag, which wants to keep it alive.
The first impulse was given by the EDIFCO, which has become aware of this project in recent days and has found a pile of debris, to put it simply.
After some writing back and forth, several people in the community have found themselves eager to rebuild the project.
I would like to ask all of you to participate in this project, because this is the only way to ensure its continuation.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can exchange ideas and work out concrete things.
You can join the server through this link.
The objectives:
* How will the MBundestag work in the future?
* What existing regulations need to be changed/adapted/removed?
* How should we behave on the outside in the future?
* How will new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I'm forgetting a few things, but that's okay, because we have Discord at the end.
If you have the time and the inclination, come to Discord, cooperate and let us decide democratically about the future.
I ordered a lampshade from you, and it's still coming.
Now I see that the article is too big/bulky for that and not for my taste.
I already ordered another hanging from you.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about that.
I hope this is returned and I get a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: does the #PRS_ORG# day blanket also exist in larger sizes, for example in 240/240?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty cabinet will be picked up in a timely manner.
And I'm asking you to do that now.
I don't have a suitable packaging, but I will disassemble the cabinet as far as possible for the collection - they have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a pick-up date.
Is there a manual for assembly?
How long would it take to get them or decide whether to return them?
How do you answer the question, why are you vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself has lived a vegetarian lifestyle for a while, and now she probably rarely eats meat.
I myself was a vegetarian for a few years before that.
When asked if I had always wanted to be a vegan and vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
And that is that for a long time I thought that being a vegetarian would be supporting animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that it would also end up supporting animal cruelty.
Hence my decision to become a vegan.
I had the impression that she was very displeased, and then she defended vegetarianism, saying that she knew where her meat came from and that being a vegetarian would reduce animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was to "plump"?
How would you answer the question?
I feel like as a vegan, you're quickly cornered and conflicts arise without which you'd be in trouble.
It greets a harmonious vegan (;
It is clearly not an exception under § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# doesn't exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I'm not there on the date assigned when #PRS_ORG# picks up my returns.
Since I can't be there for a funeral, I'm afraid that won't change.
I'd like to be assigned an alternative pick-up date.
I'm available from February 1st.
Lahnsteiner Wehr equipped for water rescue: €45,000 grant from the state
Recently, the Minister of the Interior of Rhineland-Palatinate, Roger Lewentz, presented a donation of 45,000 euros to the Mayor of Lahnstein, Peter Labonte, for the new water rescue van of the Lahnstein Voluntary Fire Brigade.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in operation since November 2020, was 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I am delighted that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this", says Lahnstein's mayor, Peter Labonte.
The equipment car is used by the diving squadron Lahnstein, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
They are used both above and below water in water and ice rescue and technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, it is expected to increase the number of jobs: the boom of the hotel shipping on the Rhine and Mosel and the further increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure stream contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of, and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed your recommendations, however, I synchronized, removed and reloaded the app.
I'm a little frustrated because the whole thing has cost me a lot of time and I'm hoping for help.
Okay, here's the deal.
I would like to order 3 items from the #PRS_ORG# collection for June.
Can I enter a date in the order process?

First of all, thank you for taking on this whole thing, I also spent almost a decade in the civil service in a similar position, we were also weapons carriers in the executive, I don't want to go into it any further!
I always find the question of right and left to be very simplified.
But basically, it should be said that, of course, the civil servant comes more from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, that should be clear to everyone.
That of course also in special uniform and gun carrier people right of conservative magically dress should also be clear to everyone that these people then of course can deal with the lived reality hard is of course also clear, because you have of course besides the average white, meanwhile many Germans with immigrant background, women and also homosexuals (and by this I do not mean the exaggerated feminine clichés, because these are in the executive rather less to none but normal men and women who do not notice it if they do not tell you) and also on these people can rely and I have to save myself, because in doubt they put you or this life for you.
But even these marginal groups, although it may sound strange in my experience, have a conservative attitude, that is, they are proud of Germany and feel less than taken by exaggerated left-wing politics, even if this policy supposedly stands up for them or thinks they have to do right, they simply want to be treated completely normally.
Back to the right, since of course the police and the armed forces are also a cross section of society you will also find extreme right there, but that these can openly express their opinion there or even openly forge any plans that threaten the state is completely exaggerated and annoys me too.
Of course, it happens that even police officers and soldiers who have often been deployed abroad often start to talk about negative experiences and sometimes say things that are controversial until politically incorrect.
It also happens that right-wing people meet and exchange ideas.
I am not sure that the Commissioner has been able to give us a full answer to this question.
Germany is so international and this is so good in my opinion that we could not afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
I ordered the other basket from the German side.
Why would this come from England?
When I ordered, it wasn't sold out.
I ordered it in November.
It was confirmed to me in your order confirmation.
It's still about my order, which is no longer available.
I was chatting with #NAME# earlier.
Alternatively, you could still deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket to Germany for #NUMBER# Euro in black or is this basket available in Germany somewhere.
I always find you the only partner company.
But at the top of the edge of the wood part are two deep notches that were filled with something yellow
And on the mirror itself is a small scratch
Ordinary by child?
Hello, I've been thinking about something for a while.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (self-employed, very little free time), but all my life I have had a hard time keeping my household clean and tidy.
There are always periods when everything is left behind, and then every now and then it grabs me and I clean up and I clean.
But it's never like this... that someone could come and visit spontaneously.
My husband is (sadly) no better either, although it bothers me somewhere but usually household loses simply against work and unhappiness.
The kitchen is still the most regularly cleaned because we love to cook.
Now, my question is, did you manage to get along with the kid?
We have not yet, but we are working on it, and this question has been on my mind for some time.
Because for me, I have no incentive, it just doesn't bother me so much, as long as no visitor comes and, for example, there is always fresh clothes and the kitchen is usable.
Do you have a bigger incentive with a child or do you stay sloppy?
I look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality, anatomically pre-shaped cut, offering maximum comfort, a perfect fit, allowing almost unlimited freedom of movement.

Career in social work -- as someone with a self-doubting personality disorder?
I did a training course in software development and I've been an apprentice for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I'm realizing more and more that this profession is not right for me, so I've been thinking for a long time about starting over and studying social work.
The problem: I have an anxiety-avoidance disorder (ADPD).
That means, roughly speaking, that I have no self-esteem and am consequently shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a more objective level, but I find it very difficult to have casual conversations and I have been told more often that I seem unapproachable (which I think I have improved).
Can I be a social worker like that?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth meeting but rather in, for example, addiction counseling or family support.
I do not know if the actual working day is really what I imagine it to be, and it is difficult to find anything about it on the Internet.
The EPS is already causing problems in my job (for me, emotionally) because it drags me down every time there is something to complain about in my code ("he's already screwed up the simplest things again") and I find it hard to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do this myself by now" / "I keep him from working with my stupid questions" / "he must really think I'm less well off" etc.).
I'll probably have problems in any profession, but I wanted to mention it at the time.
You got the sofa back, didn't you?
Because there was no confirmation of that either.
I 'm waiting for an appointment for a pick-up .
What do you mean , give it back ?
When I download a book to #PRS_ORG#, the message comes Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book
Is there a problem?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my locker.
The protein taken in by the food is broken down by the bird in its gastrointestinal tract into its individual protein building materials (amino acids) and from these in turn builds up its body's own proteins, which it also needs for the formation of feathers.
The formation of feathers in the nestling bird and the re-formation of feathers in the mauling bird are extremely complex processes and involve a particularly high level of stress for the animal's overall organism.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, as it may cause disturbances in the breeding cycle.
Following this short-term administration of NEKTON-Bio, daily vitamin supplementation should be resumed with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation).

1 g NEKTON-Bio to 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/feed daily.
One painted measuring spoon (inside) is equivalent to 1 g of NEKTON-Bio.
In case of severe damage to the feathers, the initial dose of NEKTON Bio may be doubled or tripled until the onset of feather regeneration is visible.
The normal dose is then administered until the plumage has fully regenerated.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sun exposure between 15°C and 25°C.
Excuse me, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after nine months ?
The warranty period in Germany is 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hi, I sent an email on Monday to say that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you get this e-mail?
Statement by a municipal employee contrary to the statute
Hello, German,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be cut down on our property.
So I filed a petition with the city.
A staff member writes to me that the felling of fruit trees, and therefore the walnut, is not part of the statute.
The statutes explicitly designate the walnut as a protected tree.
Can I rely on the employee's statement or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statutes are clear.
Thank you for your answers.
We understand that.
Then we'll use the new packaging for that.
I haven't received a message.
Well, then I still have a couch that I don't use.
Could you offer me a discount or a coupon?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I think so, but the question is yes, can I pay in euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany?
Can you check that?
Emergency report: serious road traffic accident involving self
A serious traffic accident has recently occurred on the St 2179 between the junction of Selb-Nord and Plößberg.
According to the police's press alert, a car has been hit by a car.
There are wounded.
Ah okay, you know.
Well, then, thank you again for making it so easy.
Advice and ideas for further professional life
Merry Christmas to you all!
My Christmas is unfortunately moderately good because my dear head is thinking of everything that can be thought of.
Before I get into it, I need advice, and I need it from people who know my situation, from you.
I'm doing the ref as a cross-breaker.
Originally I studied something else and worked in a field there as well (to at least remain a little anonymous, I will not specify anything here).
But I got bored with it all and started looking for alternatives that would make it more fun.
Eventually, I ended up in teaching, and I was sure that it was - even though the framework was much more rigid than my previous job, but I didn't care.
I'm now at the third "I Google other job postings"
And it's only been six months.
The paintings before that, I always decided to go on and at least finish the ref, after that I can still switch.
But I'm totally done right now.
I've had so little free time in the last month that I'm completely drained.
It's a holiday, but I still have a lot of work to do.
Before the rehearsal, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but then my weekend was my weekend and my night off was my night off.
I was off.
And the stress of work didn't matter in those moments.
Now even the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that annoy me even more.
Basically, it's fun, and from the outside, the ref is doing well, in terms of feedback and so on.
But I'm completely exhausted, and I wonder how much stress my body can take before it completely shuts down -- if it doesn't already.
I wonder if this is how I want to spend the rest of my working life -- especially when I'm reading some of your posts here -- or if I should go back to the old way of working, where I was valued, where I could take time off when I needed it, and the work was kind of boring, but I was paid a decent wage, and I worked together as a team, and not as a lone fighter, as it is now most of the time.
But then I wonder if I'll be back in a year's time to the same place I'm at now, and I'll be unhappy.
You'll notice that it's all kind of confusing, but maybe you have some outside advice or ideas, like me, of how to get out of this situation, where I'm completely exhausted and almost start crying at the slightest thought of it.
I'm not gonna make decisions emotionally right now, which is probably not gonna be good.
But maybe your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for now.
Thank you for reading and forgive my crying.
I hope my situation is at least a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the VOX Valvetronix series has been continuously evolving, resulting in, among other things, the combination of advanced modelling technology with the 'Valve Reactor' circuit, which perfectly mimics the behaviour of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we're introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art when it comes to sound.
Thanks to VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of the components and the amplifier circuits, the VTX amplifiers are presented with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These amps also contain the Valvetronix multi-stage tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because these get the variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers have a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonance is just bubbling.
With the Tone Room software from VOX, you can actually correct and distort historical facts on a virtual level until the amp and effects sound like you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modelling technology is due primarily to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has since been refined several times to meet new sound requirements, which in 2010 again led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and more numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed to suit all guitarists looking for maximum sound diversity.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a bold sound, a nuanced rendering of playing dynamics and string strumming, and a prompt speech.
During a detailed analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the final stage in particular determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The 12AX7 tube-equipped valve reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier perfectly reflects the behaviour, subtle nuances and sound characteristics of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner, Magic lose to Clippers
The Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA is over.
The Wagner brothers can shine, but it's not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104-106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main body is also customizable: with three individually playable and foldable shutter parts, it adapts to the needs of your photographic equipment, making it suitable for all types of cameras - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame SLR cameras.
Of course, what ultimately fits into the backpack depends on the size of the camera and the lens.
A possible accessory would be a DSLR camera with a fixed lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various Sony a7 series models or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for more lenses.
Plus, there's a whole lot of accessories to store.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series) you can use the backpack for your equipment and for things other than photography.
Drone pilots can also make the perfect choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack has enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
The eruption on La Palma is probably the longest in history
In the three months since the eruption began, the lava flows have caused extensive damage in the Canary Islands.
Is the End in Sight?
The eruption on La Palma lasted 85 days, making it the longest eruption in the history of the Spanish Canary Islands.
The eruption of Tehuya in 1585 lasted 84 days, the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on past outbreaks.
Although activity on the as-yet-unnamed Cumbre Vieja volcano has decreased somewhat in recent days, volcanologists are not daring to predict when it might end.
The indicators are showing a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable", the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, told state TV station RTVE.
Damage in millions
In the three months since the eruption began, the more than 1,000-degree lava has destroyed nearly 2,900 homes and other structures, RTVE reported.
Nearly 4,000 acres [1,200 ha] were covered by a three-foot-thick layer of lava.
That's the equivalent of almost 1,700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Offshore, two new landforms of about 50 hectares were formed by cooled lava.
The banana industry, which is of great importance to the island, has been hit hard, and about half of the island's 85,000 inhabitants live there directly or indirectly.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and other areas were severely affected, wrote the newspaper El País.
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is coming and especially the children will be looking forward to the heavenly feast.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the simmering tension, have a seductive quality.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that hold our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of gift-giving, so that the gesture of giving, which, according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss, was a peace-making "social contract of natural peoples", escapes the rigid routine and can be brought back to life in the context of this tradition.
How Nicholas Became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who made Christmas closely associated with giving.
Previously, gifts were given on St. Nicholas Day in one form or another.
The background to this custom, still popular today, is that Saint Nicholas, as bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into the windows of three women in one night to spare them from a further life of sin.
This unconventional form of gift-giving gave rise to the custom of filling the boots of children, especially, with gifts.
Protestants objected to this practice because they rejected mediators between God and man as "saints".
For these reasons, they are wary of the institution.
Martin Luther made St. Nicholas the Christ Child and thus established a new line of tradition.
The focus of the gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants do not see such details as such, only the few are annoyed that the custom of St. Nicholas is still an integral part of the Christmas season, similar to the Martins-custom with Martinsing and Martins-setting.
Today, in boots at the door and under the Christmas tree, everything you want can be found, from socks to luxury watches.
Diversity of Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources document a tradition of giving gifts on St. Nicholas' Day since the 13th century.
With the Reformation, the day of giving was moved to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian lands, however, there is a joyous gossip about who brings the presents to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether the Christ child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is basically a kind of Nicholas, to whom some peculiarities have been assigned over time.
These include, for example, his white, rough beard, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his reindeer-drawn sleigh, and the preference of the fireplace for gaining access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure of Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Holy Kings give the gifts, while in Italy, it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical beings sometimes bring the gifts, while in Russia it brought Father Frost some fame.
Here, it is not reindeer, but three horses pulling his sled as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the birthplace of the Reformation in the wake of the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for the handing out of the gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robbers near the Royal Palace
A gunman was shot dead by police near Kensington Palace in London on Saturday.
Police said that callers reported a man with a gun walking into a bank and a bookie's shop.
The man fled in a vehicle that was stopped by officers shortly afterwards, according to authorities.
There were shots fired and the man was hit.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The police didn't assume a terrorist background.
The area around Kensington Palace is home to several embassies.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which one?

The decorative lamp blends harmoniously with any bed, garden area or rock garden.
The lamp is easy to set up and can be anchored in the ground with 2 ground pins.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 Watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
The maximum duration of illumination is 10 hours.
- The robust plastic finish is suitable for outdoor use all year round.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it's mostly threatening objects from distant galaxies, glowing in color.
The sun alone makes this solar light shine in a fascinating way, whether in white or in colour (in six different colours).
The design is deliberately chosen to be borderless and amorphous: like a large pebble shaped by nature, this modern object of light presents itself in the daytime.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
It also does well in the vicinity of larger pebbles and boulders, where its size enables it to assert itself.
You can save yourself a lot of work: as a solar lamp, the Smart Stone requires no power supply or batteries.
Place the lampshade in any sunlit place during the day.
Two earth spikes are provided to provide firm support if needed.
The white plastic shell itself is strong and weatherproof.
Its solar module hides the Smart Stone discreetly inside, along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white light, the other for colored light.
The battery is charging when sunlight hits the housing.
At dawn, the Smart Stone will light up automatically, and you can choose your own colour: you can choose from six attractive light colours, including daylight white.
The battery is also automatically switched off when the battery charge is reduced to a specified minimum or when the daylight returns.
As soon as the sun comes up, the next day's charging cycle begins all over again.
I've done this a few times. It doesn't work.

The Pill Problem
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I hope I'm doing everything right here, because after a year, Reddit is actually my first post.
About my problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such incredibly bad pain during my period and shitty PMS before my period.
Now I'd like to keep that, because chronic illness means I have to take enough medication that I can't choose.
My main problem, surprisingly, is not the pain, but my skin.
I had, in my last, uh, two-year break from zero to 100, I had these explosive pimples and these everywhere.
It was superficial, but it was a lot of pressure and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two years of absence, it never really got back to normal.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid this.
I'm already wearing my perfume-free, no-spice makeup, but maybe there's something that someone can recommend.
I'm afraid the gynaecologist didn't take me seriously enough, and the dermatologist's appointment is still coming.
Many thanks to everyone who has read the novel through!
Yeah, the skin is a thing.
Had pre-buckle severe neurodermatitis, then a period of rest, then extensive nodular cysts and acne.
I've tried everything and I've stuck with low sugar, milk and low meat mixed foods because nothing else has worked so well.
It's okay that Hormonell is just the worm, but when you have a construction site like me, you don't want to look for anything else that's wrong.
I already had all your colleague's seminars.
I wrote and now I've lost the conversation and I don't know what answer I got.
I'm always working and on the phone and then suddenly everything was gone...
What's there to check? If the money was there, I would have seen it.
Please check my bank records, see if there's any mistakes.
But is there a general
It's a big black one.

110 kV ground cable to be built in 2022
The authorization for the laying of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally binding.
The planning decision of the government of Lower Bavaria clears the way for construction, which is due to begin in 2022.
This was announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven kilometres long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the commune and the existing 110 kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected to a free-range tower near the village of Edermanning near Reut.
Good morning to you.
My order of 03.01.21 with order number #NUMBER# has only arrived in parts.
The blue Betsell number: #PRS_ORG# with the shipment number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Cannot be delivered".
All three other packages have arrived, so a delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next step is?
Have a good start to the week.
You can forget that, I explained it several times yesterday!
This is a chest of drawers made of glass and the whole sides are cracked, so there is glass everywhere and the cardboard is broken
The dresser is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment because of the #PRS_ORG# regulations
That means the dresser can't be picked up because no one is allowed in my apartment.
Thank you for the news
But why only 20 euros?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it's in all the books, hence the #PRS_ORG# request, as it's probably a general problem
Ref: Planning of the lessons (EC)
Hello, colleagues,
I've been in the Ref since the summer, and I enjoy teaching, but I'm having a lot of trouble scheduling my geology class.
Unfortunately, my school is not well equipped technically, so I can only use the board, the textbook and an OHP as a medium.
I can only copy and paste for free at school (which is annoying for geography).
I just need a lot of time to plan my classes.
For example, we're currently doing the topic of geofactors, and for me, every hour is different.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand I do not want to invest too much time in simple lessons (I also need this for UBs, etc.).
I always start from the learning objective (what I want to achieve) and then think about how to build it (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra, and I'm not satisfied with most of the tasks in the book.
Hence the worksheets.
Maybe I can get a geology teacher to teach me how to work with the book in a time-efficient manner.
I'd really like that.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I've actually already decided to do a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I'd like to process the returns as soon as possible.
The retail industry is worried about the 2G regulation for the Christmas sale.
Most stores are now closed to vaccinated and recovered customers.
The trade sees this as unnecessary and complains of falling sales.
He also has a possible solution in mind.
The 2G regulations are ruining the important Christmas business of the retail trade, according to the Handelsverbandes Deutschland (HDE).
The Commission has also decided to extend the scope of the new directive to cover the whole of the EU.
According to a recent survey of 1,100 retailers by HDE, more than 70 percent of the companies had a negative view of the remaining days of the year.
Many would have already written off the Christmas business.
"What should have been the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless hole", said Genth.
Retailers with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis turnover in the past week.
It's only doing well in the food retail and online sectors.
The union demanded consequences for the dramatic development.
The chief executive said that shopping with masks, social distancing and hygiene is a safe thing to do.
"TwoG shopping is not going to get us anywhere in the fight against the pandemic", he stressed.
The current regulations were intimidating to customers and required a high level of staffing.
The new system of 'bands' must be approved nationally, he argued.
After that, each customer only needs to be checked for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) once and with the received strip, he would have access to all shops that day.
In addition, in retail trade, as in public transport under the 3G rule (vaccinated, cured or tested), random checks should suffice.
The real estate group Deutsche Euroshop, which specialises in shopping centres, also reported a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last without 2G at well over 75 percent of the pre-Corona level, the sales were at about 90 percent.
These figures will now certainly fall in the middle of such an important Christmas business", said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high human and administrative effort, the Centre is trying to find solutions and get approved.
The so-called 'band solution' is one of these, whereby 'visitors can, for example, provide their 2G ID at a central point in the centre and then - equipped with a wristband similar to that of a club hotel - can enter all shops without being disturbed'.
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and there's also a flaw in the frame, which was tried to be covered with a yellow filler.
This looks bad.
I'd like to return the mirror, and I've already wrapped it back in the package and pasted it on.
What do I do now for the return?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color reproduction.
The color temperature and brightness of the lamp are controlled by a modern microprocessor with extraordinary capabilities.
In addition to the adjustment of brightness, there are two standard colour temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and store the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller is that it is simple and intuitive to operate.
The lamp produces a very light stream with a soft light of high quality, completely free of flickering.
The 120-degree angle of illumination, which allows you to illuminate large areas at relatively small distances, is excellent.
And also in small-space or short-distance reporting situations.
You can adjust the brightness with virtually no change in color temperature.
It's a great tool to use both on set and in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows the remote control of the lamp in television studios or when the lamp is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
On the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a glowing display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
There is also a slot for the NP-F batteries (not included).
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the adjustments of the individual settings on the storage places, simply by pressing one of the storage keys for a long time is occupied and finished.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when switching off, so that the familiar situation is restored when switching on again - Very practical for studio work when the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
One of the greatest strengths of the DL3120's functionality is its ability to operate with cheap NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and camera men (and women) - so you can use already existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have sufficient power - it is a battery tester built-in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display displays (the left battery display on top, the right one on the bottom display).
In addition, it is of course possible to supply the headlamp with continuous power from the supplied mains supply.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
You have a 16mm sleeve for attachment as a connector, so you can attach it directly to your photostation.
The inclination shall be reliably adjusted by means of fixing devices on both sides.
The mechanical components were also of extremely high quality and were therefore designed for long life and hard use.
In addition, a neck joint is included in the package.
It's great that the package includes a bag.
So you can safely transport the lamp with all the accessories you may want to buy, without any problems.
Too bad, I got this as a gift and it's too small:
"Party we were going to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after torrid comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two-time winners in the series, Hessen, were supposedly on their way to the next Bundesliga playoff.
But then the SGE turned up, within a good hour, fired the frustration about a full-blown season start from the soul and won furiously with 5:2. "It's madness what the boys did today", cheered coach Oliver Glasner on DAZN and spoke a "total praise to every single person who was with".
The German authorities have also taken steps to ensure that the new rules are applied in the same way.
Patrik Schick had led the Leverkuseners with a 2-0 lead.
What happened next impressed the SGE trainer as well.
"How the players came back and gave a fantastic performance", continued Glasner.
I'm very happy with the performance we've shown and of course with the result.
Also defensive player Christopher Lenz, who for the first time since the fourth day of the game and his overcome muscle injury could stand on the field again, stressed the morale of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly great", said the 27-year-old, looking forward to the result especially for the spectators.
That's the party we were gonna have today.
For the future, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but he also feels well placed in terms of the staff situation.
It's extraordinary that we have all the players fit in December, that all the players are in top physical shape.
It's top-notch work in our medical department, but the players live professional lives, too.
The aim is to "go step by step and remain modest" and to "do the tasks at this level" by the turn of the year.
The next match is scheduled for Wednesday against Borussia Mönchengladbach (18:30 Sky).
I'm about to get the mail that my package is being returned to you by mistake on my part.
I tried calling #PRS_ORG# and redirecting it, no luck.
Can it be sent to me again directly or do I have to wait until the money has been transferred back and place the order again?
It would mean that I won't order again because it's already been a long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Women's handball cushions before the quarter-finals against Spain
Germany's handball women, after their humiliation against Denmark, have been sneaking off the field with their heads hanging and their eyes looking blank.
At the end of the main round of the World Cup, the DHB selection suffered a tough defeat at 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and must now face the host Spain in the quarter-finals.
"We were too afraid and had too much respect for the opponent", said coach Henk Groener.
We must act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the flow with us.
This was a bad game by all of us that we have to erase", said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the battle for the semi-finals, the 2019 World Cup runners-up will have to be up significantly on Tuesday to keep alive the dream of the first medal since 2007.
The best German pitcher in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backspace player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We were just not there - neither in attack nor in defence", admitted backroom player Xenia Smits, adding: "We have to look forward now, fast".
Not at height from front to rear
Unlike the previous five tournament games, the German team was not on the level with the first hand.
Misfires and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a quick 0-4 loss after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately on operating temperature and prevented some parades worse.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counter-attack.
But this was not the initial spark that had been hoped for.
The German women could hardly stand up to the aggressive Danish cover - and if they did, they usually failed to the strong Althea Reinhardt in the gate of the Scandinavian women.
The game was over at 3:10 after 20 minutes early, especially since the back-up player Mia Zschocke a little later also saw red because of a hard foul on her opponent.
But she's back in the quarterfinals.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection come into the game a little better and approached at least five goals until the break.
The already faint hope of a catch-up after the changeover was gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
Once again, the Green proteges were out of control in all areas and made it easy for the well-positioned opponent, who is one of the medal candidates in the final round.
As a result, the German team could no longer pick up a performance increase and left the field as a clear loser.

Is that what you do?
The title says that I work as a vaccination doctor in mobile vaccination teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly vaccinated in nursing homes.
Since these will soon be largely completed, part of it will then go on to vaccination centres for me.
I am happy to answer questions without time limit on the organisational and human aspects and also medical questions, as long as they are not related to a person (e.g. "I take medicine X, is it compatible with the vaccination...").
My responsibilities include vaccination information, the indication (a person is entitled to a vaccination according to the coronavirus vaccination schedule and no reasons to oppose it), medical documentation and, if necessary, emergency care for allergic reactions (never happened to me).
The vaccination itself is delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical staff.
In vaccination teams, however, we often have no pharmaceutical technicians involved in the preparation of vaccines, but "only" (for God's sake, no lack of appreciation!), but they cannot (can?) carry out vaccinations, so I also carry out most of the vaccinations myself.
The problem of the "Huidlers" is that Amberger knows the answer
What is a "Huidlerer"?
This dialect word, sent by an Amberger, has caused a lot of thought in the BR television program "Wir in Bayern".
But unlike many days before, this time the term "Host mi?" was not guessed by the callers.
No, it wasn't "someone who's nervous".
And no one who has to "make it fast".
That, people heard about the TV host, was completely wrong.
The man from Amberg then shared the solution and thus probably also caused astonishment among many Oberpfalzers.
"The Huidler", the audience learned, "is a rag that someone uses to wipe out the stove".
Antony Rowley, a dialectologist who has been interviewed by Bavarian television for years as an expert, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more familiar vernacular word "Houdern".
This closed an educational gap - probably also among some who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for two weeks.
The following error message always appears after the confirmation: oops - someting went wrong - try again later.
I restarted the #PRS_ORG#n, connected it to the PC, synchronized it and repaired it.
Nothing has helped.
Tire selection in racing - really that safe?
I woke up this morning with a lot of energy because I wanted to at least do a little bit of training in preparation for my bike ride next week.
Said and done, I rode my racing bike that I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were really nice - but then what happened happened, which is what happens in every city centre (this time: Thank you Krefeld!).
Glass splinters on the track.
Zack, loud hissing, and my rear tire was definitely not going to play the rest of the track.
Since I had no real opportunity to get a spare coat and spare hose because of the day of the week, I had to turn back in a bad mood and take the first train home.
It wasn't so bad, but maybe it's better if I practice the tire change before the bike tour.
But now I'm faced with a question, and I hope you can help me.
I would like to see this problem more often, since I have a relatively long journey ahead of me, which will take several days.
Now it was really not bad, since the old tires of the previous owner (very nice old man, the day I came to pick up the bike 120km fell off until 2 pm!) and who had also already described them as suboptimal, because he had been using them for several years.
But when I think about having to change a tire after driving 80 or 90 kilometers, I think I'm in a really bad mood.
Now I have a conversation with an older man on the platform who asked me in astonishment why I did not have the Marathon Plus tires, which are supposed to be unplayable.
Now, of course, this sounds very tempting.
But are they really that unbreakable?
I don't feel like spending $40 a tire just to be disappointed.
I'm also wondering, I think I'm on a 25x622 right now.
There are also (apparently?) Marathon Plus tires, but most are wider.
Is that a problem?
Or would you recommend a racing bike with a different tire?
The swallow side seems to me the absolute!
Thank you in advance for your help and greetings!
Car slams into tree: driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old had been on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for an unexplained reason against a central island and then hit the opposite lane, as the police said.
There was a head-on collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old man.
The 53-year-old's car was then tossed against a tree, trapping the man in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to nearby hospitals.

After the release of our new high-end B 100 6 OHM broadband, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would also have a new generation.
The new SOLO 15 is a new breed and visually resembles the larger B 200-6 OHM models.
However, this design proposal directly includes a suitably designed foot to raise the loudspeaker to the correct listening position.
This does not affect the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length to suit the home environment.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people for whom the maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but a sound level of exceptional quality is to be achieved.
A 10 cm loudspeaker is simply not capable of producing such a large sound pressure level almost unfiltered.
But that doesn't mean the SOLO 15 is weak.
On the contrary, it is growing considerably and is extremely impressive and precise for its size.
Tonal tuning of the SOLO 15 was achieved with a slight increase in pitch.
This is commonly used in broadband to optimise the over-high frequency, strongly increasing bundling.
The SOLO 15 is perfectly aligned with the listening space and offers a very clear and subtle sound.
A slightly outward-facing rotation can reduce the pitch range and thus make the sound picture warmer.
The point source makes the location of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle extremely sharp and surprisingly precise.
The B 100's extremely low mechanical losses, which are comparable to the reference 6 ohms, provide an enemy dynamic similar to its own.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our construction projects, it is advisable to start by thinking about the final appearance of the loudspeaker in order to plan appropriate changes during the construction.
If, for example, the casing is to be lined, the lowering of the loudspeaker must be adjusted accordingly, since the casing again adds material.
After cutting all the boards (e.g. in a construction shop), an 8 mm hole should be drilled in the floor plate at the appropriate place to be able to carry the cable out later without problems.
The speaker opening in the front is now followed by a top bracket, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used later with a flexible structure.
The rear part of the opening should be fitted with a 45° phase to make the opening area of the speaker chassis as large as possible.
The four bolting points of the B 100 - 6 OHM are interrupted in the phase as shown in the figure Detail Phase.
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a level surface in front of you.
The back wall, the lid, the front and the floor are now beamed on to these.
The three braces should also be inserted and glued.
The reinforcements themselves can vary in material thickness as required, if for example one wants to use ready-made slabs from the construction market instead of manufacturing them from 16 mm MDF.
The second side is then applied.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, the two sides, and the front.
A suitable perforated circular saw or a Forstner drill will facilitate the installation of the openings of the bass reflex pipe and the connection clamps on the back wall.
Then a circular milling machine is used to grind all the edges of the box.
The top of the footplate may also be rounded off.
The foot plate is then securely glued to the foot of the housing and screwed on with long wooden screws.
The following is the drawing and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the screw points of the loudspeaker chassis and the connection clamps.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (suction/blowing out), the cable is laid.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflector opening in the back wall.
The entire unshortened cable is pushed piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot to the terminal opening and left to protrude about 30 cm.
The cable is then passed through the top of the housing to the speaker opening, where it is also allowed to hang out loosely.
The frequency selector is then prepared and used.
The design of the frequency switch and the corresponding connection plan can be found in the following document:
If the frequency wiper is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is not yet completely closed, is sealed.
The 35mm bASSREFLEX opening, with a little skill, can be dripped hot glue on the opening and sealed.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and using a small lamp, the sealing can be checked accordingly.
Now, the dampening is as described.
The B 100 - 6 OHM is then connected and fixed with the appropriate screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the plus line (marked cable) has to be soldered at the plus pole of the loudspeaker (greater contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut in two and spread loosely in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be left open.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered in early June?
> Hello to all,
> finally we can announce that we will host the OSCAST again this year!
> Unfortunately, for reasons which are well known, we are unable to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short notice.
There will be at least three people per slot, so we'll be streaming the 2021 Oscars with at least seven beans and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic, so we're gonna do everything we can to make the Oscars as fun as possible.
> It will start at about 0:30.
So, why don't you chill your drinks, plan a nice meal, and get ready for a long, but very interesting night.
