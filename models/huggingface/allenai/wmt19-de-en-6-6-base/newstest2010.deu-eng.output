Barack Obama receives the Nobel Peace Prize as fourth US president
American President Barack Obama comes to Oslo, Norway, for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize here as the fourth US President in history.
He also receives the diploma, the medal and a cheque of $1.4 million for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among peoples.
The head of the White House arrives tomorrow together with his wife Michelle in the northwegian metropolis and will be busy all the time.
First of all, he visits the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time with the five committee members who elected him in October from 172 people and 33 organisations.
The presidential couple then planned a meeting with the Norwegian king Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit culminates with the ceremony at which Obama takes over the prestigious prize.
He receives this as the fourth US president, but only as the third who accepts the prize directly in office.
The White House already envisaged Obama speaking about the war in Afghanistan when he took over the prize.
The President does not want to evade this issue because he knows that he is taking over the prize as a President who is currently waging war in two countries.
He strengthened the war effort a few days ago by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forgets to highlight.
At the ceremony Obama also received the gold medal, diploma and cheque of ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to donate the money for charitable purposes, but he has not yet decided on a concrete charitable work.
The event programme will then include a banquet with the President and his wife, where the Prime Minister and another 250 invited guests will be present in addition to Norway ’ s King and Queen.
Obama was very reluctant to face the price from the outset.
He stated, for example, that he had the feeling that he did not deserve the price entirely.
He repeated several times that it is not only for him, but for those who aspire to the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he stated that this is for him "an invitation to act".
Nature conservationist is accused of blackmail
The Leitmeritz Police accused the chairman of the civil association "Naturschutzgemeinschaft Leitmeritz" for blackmail.
In several cases he appealed last year against some construction procedures, for the withdrawal of his appeals he demanded from the investors money in his favor, said the Leitmeritz District Police Officer, Alena Romova.
The chairman of the Leitmeritz and conservationist Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he is in prison and he is threatened with a prison sentence of up to three years.
The Sortier rubbish containers in Brno do not smell good
In Prague people can sort the beverage packaging, in the South Moravian villages one finds again at every step and steps the sorter of garbage containers.
And in Brno?
There you would have to reserve a few minutes to find the suitable garbage cans.
I do not want to say that separation of waste into Brno would not work at all.
But it seems to me that the Council leaders do not care enough about this problem, even if we are the second largest city in the republic.
Brno is located in the waste separation in the Urwaldliga, not only because we as citizens can only dispose of paper, glass and plastics in the sorting containers, but above all because of the number of garbage tons for such waste.
Have you ever tried to dispose of the PET bottles in a collection basket in the center?
This is art, it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I have found so far by chance is the Moravian Square opposite the Tied Goose.
Mr Onderka should not be annoyed by his colleagues, but I find that far too little.
Apart from the fact that the separation of waste is also in other parts no honey licking.
Whole rows of my friends do not sort the waste.
Out of laziness.
They are too far from the garbage cans.
I don't wonder.
Even after the celebration, I offered to dispose of a few glass and plastic bottles.
But on Konicova Street I did not see any paint waste cans in sight.
Fortunately, I came to the right place when I was driving a tram.
But the garbage almost ran over.
This is still the centre of Brno, which represents the whole city, right?!
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics probably leave the Brno socialists cold.
They prefer to buy a hockey league to the city, which makes us shameful throughout the republic, instead of buying a few garbage cans more and offering the sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my acceptance with official statistics after looking for a while on the internet.
According to the data of the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the whole district of South Moravia.
The "Paroubek" budget has withdrawn the money for pensions and sickness benefits
After the Left Party gave farmers and officials more money, despite the government ’ s view, there is no money left in the budget for pensions, sickness and construction savings.
But neither for government interest rates nor for international court disputes.
This is causing even more problems for those who will be in government in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the social democrats and communists enforced the salary increase for some groups, they reckoned that the government would borrow the money for sensitive expenditure, retirement pensions or sickness benefits in addition. "This is only a postponement of the problems into the future, mine laying," says Janota.
The loans pay higher and higher interest rates, and you have to refund the money at some point.
Too much to choose from, where to take, the state treasury is empty.
If the social security benefits or costs for the state enterprise are not cut, the tax must be increased.
For all those to whom the Left Party now gave more money: the fire brigade, the teachers, the farmers.
And later also for their children.
In order to get pensions or sickness money from whose account 1.8 billion have disappeared, people do not have to be afraid they get this money.
But at the price that the state is even more indebted - in the next year not only 163 billion will be missing in the state treasury, but much more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, debt will rise ever faster and, together with this, will also increase costs and interest rates.
The state will need the money to compensate, then it will no longer be enough to increase VAT only slightly, or to cut maternity pay, as the government has done in its counter-deficit package.
As a result of the money disbursement in favour of some electoral groups, five billion will be missing next year for motorways and railways.
It is mainly the sections won in the competition, which can no longer be re-designed and possibly discounted.
Get at most, which is also not free.
This means delay or suspension of thirty large buildings, and Europe is also at risk of creating money, warns the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it solves the outflow of money in a salomonic way - it attacks the CEZ shares dividends, where the state is the owner of the majority, and from which the money is then distributed into the transport funds.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never safe and it is by no means an infinite source.
Last year, 18 billion CEZ went into the budget.
Every year, dividends pay for environmental damage to liquidations, the pension account is filled up and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
This trick also increases the actual budget deficit to 5.7% of GDP under EU rules.
But the carnival of upheavals does not end yet.
Almost three billion fell the budget for various compensations for victims of communism and crime, or for expenditures for court disputes, even for building savings.
Whether the state can manage without this money is not certain.
This is pure gambling.
If we lose an international court dispute, we have to pay for it anyway, Janota makes it clear.
The Minister will then have to save money internally or, at worst, attack the government budget reserve.
One hundred million are also missing for the already begun two-billion project "State Treasury", which is intended to enable on-line monitoring of what the individual authorities spend the money on.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would come in this case, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
For the future, Americans expect a mobile phone on which the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The plans presented are promising.
It is enough to press just one button, and from Windows Mobile will change within seconds Android.
The American company VMware wants to introduce this very possibility, which focuses on the development of virtual software for computers.
We enable you to execute two user profiles simultaneously on your mobile phone.
You can switch between these, you can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, Srinivas Krishnamurti from the company VMware indicated during the interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and presented for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization of smart phones is not fiction.
VMware successfully introduced the smartphone to journalists with two operating systems.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB RAM memory, which simultaneously featured Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
Now the company VMware is working together with the European and American operators on the smartphone virtualization and to the customer the devices are to come within the year 2012.
Snow fishing on the mountains torments the hotel owners
Scneelose slopes make Sorgenn not only the Giant Mountains.
The lack of snow also discourages people from ordering ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore you can still get free rooms in Giant Mountains for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are frequently visited.
People go through the offers, determine the prices, but in the meantime they are afraid to order binding.
And when they call us, they immediately ask, whether in our opinion this year's Christmas will be on snow or "on mud", the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, led.
Who wants the New Year's Eve stay in the Spindelmühle exactly according to his ideas, should not hesitate with the order.
Those who prefer saving and where the quality of the stay comes second, can try to wait a few more days.
In the meantime, the Spindelmühle hotel owners offer only weekly stays for New Year's Eve.
I think that they will try for a while to sell them, but then they too will have to give in and respond to shorter times.
And then the free rooms will fade quickly, esteemed Jandura.
The travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi always offers free beds on all winter dates.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not yet sold out.
In our offer about half of the places are still free.
Therefore we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays for the last moment, the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert, led.
The Vrchlabi Travel Agency can also offer New Year ’ s Day in Giant Mountains, but there are less free places here.
Good sales also find the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year the interest in winter stays is also negatively influenced by the fact that there is always no snow in Giant Mountains.
People wait to see if snow falls.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snow-covered within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, says Schiefert.
Conversely and somewhat better than last year, the rooms at Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou can be occupied.
We are about five percent better than last year.
On New Year's Day and Christmas we only have a few free rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in January, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec's hotel, Karel Rada.
80 percent for the New Year's Eve stays is also the Hotel Omnia at the central parking lot in Janske Lazne occupied.
In contrast, half of the beds remain free at Christmas in the latest hotel in Janske Lazne.
This year we were pleasantly surprised by January, for which we are currently already occupied by about 60 percent.
A little weaker is now February, but at the moment when the snow comes, the interest in staying in the Giant Mountains certainly increases, the director of the Omnia Hotel, Erik Sporysch, said.
The Giant Mountains are waiting for more snow.
On Thursday it should cool down and if there is rainfall, it should be snow on the mountains.
But after that a warming will come again, informed Jiri Jakubsky from the location of the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repetition is Mother of Wisdom
It is almost funny with which pupil stubbornness Barack Obama, the president with his reputation of the wisest, repeats the strategy of his predecessor in the Afghanistan issue he considered to be the most stupid.
When he finally sweated out his long-awaited Afghanistan ’ s doctrine, it turned out that he wrote it off three years ago via the copy paper from the Bush Iraq scene.
Not only did he use the phrase "as in Iraq" several times in the text himself, he even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New way forward" without hesitation.
Three years ago, he himself criticised the Bush administration's idea of sending fresh troop quotas to Iraq, which was plagued by the civil war, as "irresponsible and disastrous in its conclusions."
The following months showed, however, that the Bush Strategy, based on recommendations from the military, was the only possible and, to that extent, very successful, that the news about Iraq no longer speaks at all.
This did not improve Bush ’ s reputation, because objectively he left his successor a much more grateful starting point than he expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will be repeated.
He was once again asked by the military to increase the contingent of the troops, especially the commander of Afghanistan ’ s operation, General Stanley McCristal, who, even in spite of the subordination habits, criticized the enchanting shooters in the White House hard.
He called for 40,000 soldiers to reverse the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but did not come up with a better idea and so he betrayed the general wenistens by 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe he has pressed the promise for another 5,000, even if he himself originally calculated at least 10,000.
Highly problematic for the Obama strategy as a whole is his plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and complete this process within three years. Obama ’ s doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the halved increase will have the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Even in spite of the fratricidal war of the last years, Iraq is relatively well structured, its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is characterised by contraindication - no one can be relied upon and no agreements are made.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, who are accustomed to changing their minds every day.
The political institutions, even if they were formally founded correctly, remain only pseudo-buildings behind which the patriarchal ancestral relations will continue to grow.
The balance of interests between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the unclarity of the conditions that further complicate Pakistan and Iran ’ s influences.
It is also very unrealistic to build a "state capable of action", which is the minimalist objective of the whole operation.
Obama ’ s time horizon strategy alienated by his voluntarism
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated and is now on the brink of the explosion.
Believing that the small soldiers who have broken into the cry of war about "return home early" create a miracle here can only be a truly romantic soul that cannot be impressed by facts.
From the political point of view, the date for the withdrawal of troops is sheer irresponsibility, because the Taliban will accept this as the indirect confession of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that Europeans' willingness to participate in the fighting in Afghanistan is running out.
Europe ’ s politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how Germany ’ s or Italy ’ s security is related to the Hindu Kush war.
Another possible factor that can radically influence the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not affect Iranians, the United States will have a very serious question as to whether the problem should not be resolved by troops.
This question must be answered in the period in which America is moving towards Obama ’ s victory in Afghanistan.
But any solution will also mean a dramatic change in the Afghan situation.
The only consolation for Barack Obama is the fact that three more years remain until the presidential election, so there is still enough time for him to resort to a different strategy, which would turn out to be a total failure.
Bank Goldman Sachs managers no longer receive bonuses in cash
American Bank Goldman Sachs executives will no longer receive bonuses in cash this year.
This was announced by the company, which thereby reacts to the harsh criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receives shares instead of the money, which can only be sold in five years.
In addition, the shares may be withdrawn from managers in the event that they operate excessively risky.
Goldman Sachs is thus at the forefront of Wall Street ’ s efforts to combine Wall Street ’ s premium bonuses with long-term performance, according to Reuters.
I believe Wall Street is aware of the wider direction in which it has to go, led by the former banker of JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after setting aside nearly $17 billion for premium bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
According to Reuters, the total premium bonuses over the course of this year are likely to exceed $20 billion, despite the measure announced today.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue with the start of the financial crisis in a whole range of countries.
Britain reported on Wednesday that it intends to impose a 50% tax on bankers ’ bonuses that exceed £25,000.
France is preparing similar steps.
This year, women won the Nobel Prize in all disciplines, except in physics.
Today in Stockholm, five record-breaking women took over this year ’ s Nobel Prizes in the categories and literature from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI. Gustaf.
In addition to the four female scientists, Herta Müller, the German writer of Romanian descent, was among them.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine was awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their compatriot Jack Szostak, for research in the area of chromosones.
The Israeli Ada Jonath, together with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, received the Chemistry Prize for the Enlightenment of the Ribosom.
The last laureate awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics, which the American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson received for analyses of the economic report.
The only category in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
The scientists Charles Kao and George Smith, together with Willard Boyl for the CCD chip, have won this award today for their research in the glass fibres sector, which is the basis of all digital cammeras, fax machines or astronomical telescopes.
Each of these winners has received the diploma, Nobel medals and certificate of acquisition of the money prize.
This amounts to ten million Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are several winners in each category, the money prize will be divided among them.
The American President, Barak Obama, has traditionally received the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo this afternoon.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of his appointment because he was only at the beginning of his journey, and he was also at the head of the country that waged two wars - Iraq and Afghanistan.
In keeping with his policies, however, he added that wars in certain situations are necessary for the struggle for world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota contemplates the resignation. Klaus invited him to the castle
On Friday morning, President Vaclav Klaus receives the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, who thinks about remaining in government because he disagrees with the implementation of the state budget for next year in the form that was released by the Assembly of Members on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps the stay of Janota in the cabinet will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which also deepens the crisis of public finances.
The presidential spokesman, Radim Ochvat, informed about the meeting.
Janota intends to negotiate on Monday with the Premier, Jan Fischer, about his further stay in his position.
The Czech Republic should operate with a deficit of 163 billion kroner, according to the budget and the law which is now being signed by Klaus.
On Wednesday, however, Parliament voted on the Left Party ’ s proposals for a monetary revolution and increased the money for public servants ’ salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and direct wages for farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of the Social Democracy to hide the budget deficit.
Between the Left Party on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right-wing party, on the other hand, a sharp domestic political dispute has therefore arisen, whereby the question mark arises about the further work of the Fishermen's Cabinet of Officials, on whose design the ODS, CSSD and Green Party agreed in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as adopted by Parliament, virtually liquidates the austerity package enforced by the fishermen ’ s government in the autumn, and that, in their understanding, it is intended to end public debt.
Klaus, who is able to sign the law on the state budget, but does not have to do so, said today at the discussion breakfast with the entrepreneurs that the politicians have neglected the "serious problem" that constitutes the "untenable deficit" of public finances for a long time.
In his opinion, there is no good solution today.
An improvement could only bring about a strong government that could build on a broader consensus among political parties.
The president of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, said that the budget is horrible, and that the government should balance its continued existence.
The ODS deputy chairman, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the Cabinet of Officials with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party obviously no longer works.
In the editorial board, Premier Fischer described similar words as "strong claims".
The CSSD leader, Jiri Paroubek, responded to Topolanek ’ s words that the budget deficit was horrible, that Topolanek ’ s former government had prepared for this year, exceeding 200 billion crowns.
Already on Wednesday, the CSSD rated the approval of the state budget as a success for next year.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new movie by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood premier movie "Invictus: The Undefeated" of the world shows much of the country, of its struggle and victories despite some criticisms that the leading role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells of sport, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid system of government in the South African Republic, as well as its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is the American Oscar Freeman actor, Morgan Freeman, in his life story.
Freeman said that he was asked by ninety-one Mandela whether he could portray him in Eastwood film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I told him, "When I'll play you, I'll have to meet you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who received the award for his role in the Eastwood drama from the box section "Million Dollar Baby", already represented the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, from which finally became a slave holder, a fictitious US president, and also God in "Evan Almighty", but rarely someone who still lives and is as important as Mandela for many people.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his active work in ending apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was set free in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "undefeated", and at the same time it is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was how to speak
The film depicts a true event in which Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that even after apartheid, his people are still divided in racial and economic terms.
He believes that he can unite his people through sport, so he decides to unite rugby players who are among the outsiders worldwide.
Finally, the South African team continues to rise into the World Cup of 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to bring Mandela ’ s history to the cinema screen.
He had no other goal but to play this role as closely as possible to bring it closer to reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge was, of course, to speak as he did.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet Mandela, have dinner with him and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela ’ s hand.
I have noticed when I shake your hand, I take over your energy, it is transmitted, and I had the feeling that I know what you feel, he said.
For me it is important to have become another person.
Matt Damon presents in the film François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players dominated.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the tough rugby world.
It was a big surprise for him when he met Pienaar in his house for the first time.
I remember when I rang the door bell that it opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was: 'I look much bigger in the film'.
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors in comparison with their actual role models, he has received positive reviews under the direction of director Eastwood "Invictus: Ungeschlagen" and one also speaks of prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summarized his evaluation in the following words: "This was very good story, very well executed film."
In the film reviews on the web pages rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 percent positive evaluations.
Light secret about Norway dissolved: The Russians tested a rocket
A special light effect of unknown origin could be observed about Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence acknowledged only yesterday that an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested near the Norwegian border.
The launch, however, was not successful again and the missile known as "Bulava", which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the nightmare of the Russian generality and the prime minister, Vladimir Putin.
Also his repeated presence on site at the missile test had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava has mostly not been started at all or damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers one already writes about "Bulava" as about a "missile that does not fly".
A rocket that does not fly, but shines
This 13th attempt was normal at the beginning.
Only at the end of the flight did technical damage occur to the rocket.
Probably the engine exploded in the third rocket stage.
This time "Bulava" started from the atom of the boat Dmitry Donskij, which drove under the waters of the White Sea.
This rocket type allows launching from the U-boat.
Therefore, it is probable that the mysterious light caused by an indefinite flying object over northern roads was actually the damaged "Bulava".
Moreover, the Norwegians have not doubted since the first moment that it was a Russian missile.
The generality has this time guarded itself against it and asserts that one cannot speak clearly of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fail and the accident only affected the third stage.
In previous cases the engines were damaged in the first stage.
Even if no test start was made without error, the administration of the Ministry of Defence considers only six out of thirteen unsuccessful.
The almost fifty percent success therefore fulfils the generality with optimism and so it is maintained that the "Bulava" will fly once without problems and will carry even up to ten hypersonic nuclear warheads with a total weight of max. 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
The legendary defensive player Vjaceslav Fetisov introduces himself at the age of 51 in a professional hockey game.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup owner helps his team CSKA Moscow in need, and is likely to compete against Petersburg in the Friday duel KHL.
Fetisov, who completed his career at the age of forty, in 1998, is currently President of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas was injured, we urgently need another defensive player.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed to support the team.
We only need to clarify some remaining formalities, the agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow club of Sergei Nemcinov.
Meanwhile it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous hockey player will concern only one game.
I mean that Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morality of other players, Mitspieler Nemcinov listed.
When Fetisov comes back to the ice surface, he becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey game according to AP.
In the NHL, the legendary forward Gordie Howe has played a whole season for Hartford with fifty-one years and was able to score 15 hits and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous Five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
In the Soviet Union he won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championship titles and he has also triumphed in Canada Cup as well as in the Junior Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also gained successes in the NHL, where he twice raised the Stanley Cup over his head in Detroit ’ s Dress.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the ice hockey club Sternzimmers.
Hyundai gave in to the unions. All overtime work is cancelled
The management of the Nosovice Automobile Factory Hyundai agreed with the union on the abolition of all overtime.
Due to frequent overtime, the union announced its willingness to strike on Monday.
This was confirmed by Petr Vanek, spokesman for the Hyundai automobile factory.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unionists on a Saturday shift this week.
We must not abandon our production plan, which is a principle, which is why voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday 19 December for the reason that two working groups would be working, Vanek said.
The Sedmicka.cz website wrote that the company offered a bonus of CZK 400 to employees who would work on Saturdays.
The staff will also receive it for the Saturday shift of 28 November.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the motivation of employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they can pay the overtime surcharge or they can take replacement holidays on 28 December and thus prolong the Christmas holidays, led Vanek.
In addition, all Saturday shift employees are paid the fare and lunch.
Having regard to the fact that overtime was the most urgent and burning point in the demands and complaints of trade unionists who had stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the abolition of all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk pointed out.
The employees of the automobile factory had been forced until last week to work practically every day after the eight-hour shift still 2 overtime.
Once the agreement has been signed, trade unions will revoke their willingness to strike.
Further negotiations between the management of the automobile factory and the trade unionists are due to take place on Friday afternoon.
The union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can agree to meet the demands and sign a joint document, they would be prepared to lift the strike.
The situation in the automobile factory was exacerbated last week, on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously struck because of constant overtime.
They also protested against the bad payment conditions and alleged harassment.
The management held against it that the coworkers must make the overtime to the adherence to the automobile delivery need.
The trade unionists also demanded in their Mondays ’ strike call that the employees who had interrupted production last Wednesday should not be sanctioned.
In the area of overtime, trade unions demand that overtime work be reduced to a minimum.
In addition, they are calling for the payment of 5000 crowns this year.
The Nosovice-Automobilfabrik Hyundai now employs 2000 people.
The series production was started in the company last November.
By this September, around 80,000 vehicles were manufactured here and the current production capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also affects HIV virus
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds to prevent the spread of HIV virus in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works with viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact predominates against the disadvantage that the compound does not have as much effect on common viruses as one of the existing medicines.
The disease AIDS cannot yet be cured.
The drug composition can, however, prolong the life of the patient and prevent the increase of HIV viruses in the body.
However, your intake is accompanied by a whole series of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of virus reproduction also results in the development of resistance viruses against which no medicines are effective.
The work of the experts of three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, of the VSCHT (Chemical Technological University) Prague as well as of the University of Heidelberg opens the way, how one can deal with the virus's resistance.
They have shown that the substances referred to as metalokarborane act on the protein substance responsible for the propagation of the HIV viral.
Metalokarborans are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the virus ’ s proliferation in a way other than all medicines used today, which is why they can overcome the resistance issue.
In their work, the scientists arrive at new 'improved' compounds which were prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding on the viruses of protein.
The metallic carborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multifaceted cages consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and coupled by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
insidious and persistent virus
The protease of HIV is a protein of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
No mature infectious virus particles would develop without the HIV and virus splitting caused by the HIV protease.
When we switch off HIV ’ s protease, we also eliminate the proliferation of the virus in the patient ’ s body, the scientists explain in the press report published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the paper published in the journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe whole rows of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are coupled by a short organic chain, which is then further systematically altered.
Slightly weaker but more reliable
The effects of this series of substances against HIV ’ s protease were tested in the test tube, also against their resistant (resistant) variants, which were obtained from HIV ’ s infected patients.
The effect of metalocarborans on the common enzyme is not as strong as on clinically used medicines, but it does not lose its effect on the resistance variants, against which the used medicines are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action and its further properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical designs, makes metalocarborans interesting compounds for further research aimed at developing effective medicines against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, Head of the Structural Biology Laboratory of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Dispute over budget. ODS started on fishermen, who resisted
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for next year as "gruesome" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should in his opinion consider their continued existence.
The statement of the ODS was described by the Prime Minister as "strong statements".
It is supposedly time for analysis.
Deputy Chairman of the ODS, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the Cabinet of Officials, with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party, obviously no longer works.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to base himself on the minority in Parliament when it comes to fighting the rising deficit, or whether he wants to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of the ODS and Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, as Necas pointed out.
On Wednesday, Parliament adopted the budget for 2010, but with left-wing amendments for more than 12 billion crowns.
Parliament has increased the money for public servants' salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has countered the proposals of the Social Democracy that they hide the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage with a backlog of 163 billion kroner.
The ODS left the Chamber before the vote, so it fulfilled the government's wish, because the amended budget is only a less bad variant of the budget provisional.
Disappointment and meaninglessness
The finance minister, Eduard Janota, talked about his disappointment and a sense of meaninglessness, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government is still judging the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened to resign in the event that the amendments were adopted, the situation would look different.
According to Czech television Janota has registered with the Premier for Monday after the government transaction.
He has indicated that he is considering his further stay in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment at the budgetary negotiation.
To what extent fishermen support the further struggle with the budget deficit, according to Necas the nominants of the Social Democracy (CSSD), who had enforced the changes in the budget, have nothing to do with the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if Parliament continues to adopt deficiencies that increase laws, such as those relating to health care and pensions or the service law amendment.
Topolanek: The Ministers nominated by ODS were not mistaken
That is up to the Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS did not make any mistakes, Topolanek pointed out in a text message from the USA.
It has been mentioned that in some ministries there are vice-presidents who are committed to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if Fischer decides to abandon the fight against the deficit level of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that he is based on the left-wing majority currently in Parliament."
Then he allegedly cannot count on the support and tolerance of the citizens ’ democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if it is up to date, I will deal with it, said the Minister of Defence, Martin Bartak, nominated by the Citizens' Democrats, to the journalists in Parliament.
Premier Fischer flew to Brussels at the European Council in the afternoon.
The ODS resigned at the request of the Prime Minister
At the same time, Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget in Parliament on Wednesday if the Prime Minister explicitly asked the members of the Citizens' Democrats to allow the budget to be adopted.
We are not orphans, we are not small children, and he then reacted to the question of whether the ODS was not pushed back during the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the party leader in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I did not notice that my voice would be missing.
Already when I renounced the mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be primarily about Bolshevising Parliament and destroying everything positive, Topolanek himself reacted.
According to the new timetable of the CD (Czech Railways) fewer trains will travel for about the same fare.
The Czech Railways will end or restrict some less busy fast and local trains from 13 December, while other connections will be strengthened.
The total volume of traffic will be reduced by two percent from the date of validity of the new roadmap compared to today.
Most rates incl. basic and customer fare will not be changed.
Several connections to the capital are provided, for example, by the inhabitants of the Ostrava region, and the railways use Pendolino trains for this route.
The fast train will no longer travel to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less fast trains will also travel on the route Prague - Pisek - Budweis, in principle direct connections from Prague to Letohrad will be reduced.
The largest reduction is planned by the railway in the district of Hradec Kralove (Königsgraz), a total of eight percent, but Prague and its surroundings can look forward to an increase.
There are also two night trains on the route Prague - Tabor - Budweis and to some days a week the operation of some fast trains on the route Prague - Pisek - Budweis is reduced.
One of the major changes is the introduction of the new direct transport route from Milovice to Prague, currently the inhabitants of Milovice have to change to Lysa nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth route of the Esko suburban transport system, which can be opened thanks to the Lysa nad Labem railway electrification to Milovice.
The long-distance routes to the capital will end in the destination station Prague - Central Station.
The CD introduces more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Sumperk / Jesenik will travel in two hours.
With the Pendolino, passengers can no longer travel to Bratislava since 13 December.
This year's bill for regional railways: 200 million rise
The high-speed trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport. In total, the railways will receive four billion kroner for the settlement of the so-called liquidity loss in the next year, just like this year. Local trains will supply the districts, and in total they will pay eight billion kroner in the next year, with the state shooting three billion.
This year, the regional trains cost 200 million Czech crowns.
For local trains as well as fast trains, the railways have reconcluded a ten-year contract, so far the contract has always been concluded for only one year.
The railways praise the system, and perhaps that is why they did not use it to increase prices in the vast majority of tickets.
Changes occur only with one day network tickets CD Net and with favorable Internet tickets eLiska.
For passengers without the customer card the price CD Net is increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price eLiska will then depend on the driven way, until now it was uniform for a trip between any district towns and cost 160 crowns.
Philippine millionants capture more than 50 people, the children were released.
Millitante kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines today, including some primary school students and their teachers.
This is what the AFP agency said, which originally informed only about 65 abductees.
All 17 children were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The abduction took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Approximately 19 millitantes allegedly used the hostages as a living shield when fleeing from the police.
The local negotiators are now trying to release the remaining hostages.
According to the agency AFP, the millionaires belong to the New People ’ s Army (NPA), this is the armed faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police persecuted the kidnappers for the violence that demanded acts of revenge between the two local families.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, the right to stand was imposed for the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre, which coincided with the election to the Board of Governors, were 30 journalists.
Due to suspicion of participating in the massacre, the governor of this South Philippine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, Patriarch of the influential Ampatuan, were arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
But they reopened the peace negotiations with the government of the Philippines on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods will enter American cinemas "Invictus: the Undefeated", which includes part of the life story of the former President of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, who was supposedly elected by Mandela himself a few years ago, has been given the role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid.
The supporting role of the legendary South African champion in Rugby, Francois Pienaar, was won by Matt Damon.
With the release of the film, reactions from critics and the public are also loud.
Nelson Mandela
His name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born in Mvez, South Africa on 18 July 1918.
In 1988 he received the Sachar Prize, in 1993 he won the Nobel Peace Prize together with de Klerk.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994.
Great expectations are placed in the film because it comes into the cinemas at a time when in South Africa on the one hand the preparations for the World Cup culminate, at the same time the media shake the world public with frightening news about the rising racial hatred and the discrimination of the inhabitants on the part of the black ruling majority.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are for the time being consistently positive, despite numerous reservations against the occupation of the leading roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is still proud of the new film in his own words.
I dreamed of this role for many years and prepared myself well for it.
Several times I met Nelson Mandela personally, so that I can receive his energy, as we say, he performed in an interview after the film ’ s Festival premiere in Los Angeles.
I think that it is good if we can get the personality of Mandela and his message with this film.
This is a history of South Africa, but it affects everyone, he added.
National Rugby Team Dress
The film is based on the book of the British writer John Carlin, freely translated 'In the Role of the Enemy': Nelson Mandela and the game that united the people portrays the South African advocate of human rights within his first presidential election period.
In the course of the film Morgan Freeman endeavours to bring together two race groups and, since year and day, each other separated population groups and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also enters the world cup field in his role in the South African National Rugby League, which won South Africa at that time.
Mandela made great ovations fourteen years ago, mainly from the white audience, to enter the lawn in the dress, which is almost a sacred act in South Africa, thus gaining the recognition of the white population.
The Rugby Championship might bring people together to form a single people, led by rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa improves, that will only show.
But the white South Africans are sceptical, as Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to the UK, for example, betrayed in a recent interview for LN of Rugby.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In the Louny region burning transformers for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out in the morning at the transformer of the company Ceps in the switchgear near the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny region.
During the fire, six units intervened according to the spokesman of the Usti nad Labem District Fire Brigade, Lukas Marvan.
Originally, the fire brigade wanted the transformers to burn out, but later it changed the view and now the fire is extinguished with a mixture of water - foam and special substances.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer and internal short-circuit.
No one was injured, the accident did not endanger the safety operation of the management system according to Pavla Mandatova.
The damage was estimated at several 10 million crowns, more precisely the damage will only be quantified after the fire.
The destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one according to Mandatova.
For more than 10 years nothing similar has happened to the company Ceps, errors of this kind are rare, she added.
The power supply was not interrupted by the CEZ spokesperson for Northern Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, but by the fire of the transformer station the functioning of households, authorities and companies was not affected.
A.G. Ceps operates in the Czech territory as sole operator of the pipeline system, the electrical lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, refurbishes and develops 39 switchgear units with 67 transformers, which transmit the electrical energy in distribution system and line track with a length of 4339 kilometres.
Jancura raises charges for defamation against three CSSD leaders.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, today raises charges for slander against three socially democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district of Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute Inteview in the radio journal.
The lawsuit is related to the company's effort to operate regional train traffic in some districts.
However, all regions have finally signed the long-term contracts with the Czech railways.
All three leaders attack us and say that we take out the raisins, but we only put the offer on the scale as was agreed with them.
They claim that we are expensive than Czech railways because we would know the prices of Czech railways that were completed last week.
So we have nothing else left but to defend ourselves.
Because of this slander of the Society Student Agency, Jancura said to the radio journal.
At the same time, he stated that he has evidence from all districts that they have taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing an indictment for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the investigation of the lawsuit to be a further continuation of Jancura ’ s media show, which serves him as a free advertisement for his society and for his own person.
I am, of course, prepared to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I also call on other leaders to do so.
I assume that on this matter too it will be clear that it is Jancura who is manipulating the public in the matter of regional rail transport and using lying and untrue arguments, said Hasek.
Jancura reported last week that he had invested several million crowns in advertising, which will indicate the adverse step of the districts.
He told the radio journal that he interrupted the campaign after Christmas and wanted to continue it after New Year.
He specified that he will lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign was launched by Jancura, after the districts had agreed to operate regional rail transport with the Czech Railways and had not tendered tenders for a contract of 150 billion kroner.
Such behaviour is illegal and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
According to Jancura, he was already threatened by a member of the CSSD because of the criticism of train traffic in the districts.
The only threat was, if we do not give up, that we can also lose the bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who he is, I am not saying his name, said Jancura to the radio journal today.
Vaccination against pneumococci free and voluntary
Immunization against pneumococci will change the habitat from January.
It is said to be the first for families free and voluntary.
But voices are already saying that the obligation to vaccinate would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococci culminate.
The pharmaceutical institute already determines the maximum prices of vaccines that health insurance companies have to pay.
The experts are also aware of the vaccination process.
New vaccination
Vaccines free for August and children
From January onwards, children can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococci, which were born on 2 August last year and later.
The condition is that they have not yet received a vaccination dose.
Those who have already started vaccination in the last year or earlier must also pay for repeat vaccination themselves.
The first dose of vaccination must be given between the 3 and 5 months of the child's life.
Last year, a quarter of the families had their children vaccinated against pneumococci.
The parents paid 1600 crowns and more for a dose.
The vaccination of the youngest children requires four doses.
On the whole, the experts estimate that health insurance companies spend 300,000 to 450,000 crowns per year on vaccination doses.
But they save on the treatment that children would need without vaccination.
Until now, the state has spent about 500,000 per year on all land vaccinations for children.
The obligation to vaccinate was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococci cause middle ear inflammation, but also serious infections including cerebral inflammation and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections lead to the death of up to 28 children up to 10 years of age in hospitals per year.
Outside the Czech Republic, the obligation to vaccinate children against pneumococci was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be a duty?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be a duty in the future.
From January onwards, the insurance will be paid and voluntary.
Rudolf Kalovsky, head of the Nahlas Civil Association, mentioned that the obligation to vaccinate would be better.
His association is already promoting pneumococci vaccination in the long term.
The experts at the international conference in which our association was involved were not very satisfied with the fact that we have voluntary vaccination.
This is not quite ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have succeeded in enforcing at least that.
I believe that this is the way we have to go now, Kalovsky said.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococci.
At this moment we do not consider this at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
Voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, doctors claim.
Hana Cabrnochova, president of the Association of Practical Pediatricians, admits that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, one could think about reducing the number of repetitive vaccines "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination has been started as a voluntary one", says all dingst Cabrnochova.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to vaccinate their infants against pneumococci from next year.
Vaccination against pneumococci is also groundbreaking in the fact that it is the first area vaccination that is paid by health insurance and not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend the money on prevention to save them for further treatment, Cabrnochova says.
Doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
This, however, involves a concern of the practical paediatricians concerning the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original project, the vaccines should be purchased by insurance companies and the doctors should receive them on the same path as other vaccines issued to them by the state.
However, some MEPs feared that the insurance companies could 'export the money from the health insurance company'.
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait until the insurance companies pay them.
According to estimates, individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 crowns per month, which is a significant sum.
This will not be easy, says Cabrnochova.
U.S. artist's son involved in "museum theft"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million from his father ’ s museum.
According to the Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught in his trailer when he loaded 90 paintings.
It is said that Frank Frazetta junior and another man had used an excavator to enter the museum in the Pocono mountains.
The 81 year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his portrayal of figures such as Conan der Barbar and Tarzan.
As reported by the Associated Press news agency, the artist stayed in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said that Frank Frazetta Junior might have been motivated by a family feud.
The agency reported, according to a police affidavit, Frazetta Junior claimed that he was instructed by his father "that he should enter the museum with all means to bring all the paintings into a camp."
The agency announced that Frank Frazetta Senior denied to have granted any permission.
Labour defends budget and tax increases
Ministers defended the tax increases and expenditure stoppages announced in the preliminary report against the criticism of the opposition, the economy and the trade unions.
The Conservatives said that Alistair Darling had "missed" an opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by ousting decisions until after the election.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer was also under attack for targeting low- and middle-income workers.
Its main proposals include a 0.5% increase in social security and a 1% cap on public wage accounts for 2011.
Social security coffers
The trade unions have protested that low-wage recipients are being punished for a recession that they have not caused and warned of upcoming "problems".
The increase in social security - to about £3 billion a year - has annoyed the private sector, saying that this is a tax on jobs, although attention should be paid to economic recovery.
The increase, which is limited to those who earn more than £20,000 per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
POINTS OF THE PREVENT REPORT
An additional 0.5% increase in social security from April 2011
This year ’ s economy shrinking by more than the expected 4.75%
New 50% Tax on Banker Bonuses
1 percent increase in corporation tax discarded for small businesses
Control trays for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase in government pensions by 2.5%
According to treasury estimates, someone with an annual income of £30,000 will be £90 per year poorer, and someone with £40,000 per year will be £190 poorer, while a person with £10,000 will be £110 richer.
Ministers said that their deficit reduction target by 2013 was "difficult decisions", but they also said that 60% of the additional tax burden would be accounted for by 5% of the top earners.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the tax hikes and expenditure stoppages outlined were "a drop in the ocean" compared to the necessary measures.
"These are large figures. They will bring us the deficit reduction and this is absolutely necessary over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
Labour ’ s projections of future economic growth – affecting the size of new debt and the speed of deficit reduction – were questioned after the Chancellor of the Exchequer was forced to revise earlier figures.
He said in his opinion that the economy is likely to shrink by 4.75% this year - far more than the 3.5% decline predicted in April - while the £3 billion debt would be higher than previously estimated.
"Missing Opportunity"
Conservatives who want to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn of Labour's "debt crisis" said that the planned £789 billion debt over the next six years was unsustainable.
They added that ministers have failed to present a credible plan on how to repay this and are "cynically" about difficult decisions until after the election - which must take place by June 2010 at the latest.
"They didn't say anything about what they were going to do," said the shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had an opportunity to do so, and they let them pass by."
"The important announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins them".
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals, and the police be preserved from future cuts, unlike the Conservative proposals, which see deficit caps coming faster and sooner.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money won by the tax increases and expenditure stoppages is used to cover next year's expenditure, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans are 'built on sand'.
The BBC political editor, Nick Robinson, said that at the time of the announcement - like the above inflation adjustment for some disability pensions next April - the Chancellor of the Exchequer would suspend the accusation of voting, because the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour insists on providing extra aid when people need it the most and the situation will be reviewed again in September 2010.
"Hohler Etat"
Although ministers have not disclosed budget details beyond 2011, economists say that pressure on public spending will only come to bear in the medium term.
The recognized Institute for Tax Investigations said that the Chancellor's figures would mean strong cuts in many areas, possibly in the areas of transport, higher education, science and defence in the future.
"It only shifts the pain to later," said his head Robert Chote.
"The important announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins them," added Roger Bootle, economic consultant at the auditing firm Deloitte.
"This was only the hollow advance budget report. Markets recognize that."
FBI investigates "arrests of U.S. citizens in Pakistan"
The FBI investigates the arrest of five US citizens on suspicion of extremist links in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in an attack on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Punjab province, and the American Embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it is being investigated whether these are the same men who were reported missing last month in the US state of Virginia.
The US State Department said that they are also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are said to be Pakistani, one is of Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
"If they are American citizens, of course, we are very interested in the charges they are accused of and under what circumstances they are being held," said Ian Kelly.
The FBI spokesperson Katherine Schweit said the authority was informed about the arrests and was in contact with the families of missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there, if they are the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington announced that the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of the students.
He said that the local police had previously been interested in the house and that no charges had yet been filed against the arrested men.
The Reuters news agency reported that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, but she said that the US "must work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism, which continues to recruit and train people".
The five students were reported missing by their families in North Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns "abuses" in Iran
According to a report by the human rights organisation Amnesty International, it is still as bad about human rights in Iran as it has been in the past 20 years.
The report detailed 'patterns of abuse' by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
A man cited in the report stated that he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, and another said that he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected earlier criticism of its human rights record.
Official bodies said that such criticism was politically motivated.
After President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’ s election, thousands of people were arrested in Iran and dozens were killed, leading to the biggest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens received prison sentences and prosecutors said that at least five people were sentenced to death.
The BBC correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recognized some of the abuse claims and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak Penitentiary.
But since then there has been no tolerance for criticism on the part of the authorities, our correspondent said.
"False confession"
Amnesty International quoted the report of the 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said that he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and of protesting against the election results.
"They often hit me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head... They threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days he signed a false confession and, still bleeding and half-unconscious, was released on the street, Amnesty announced.
The defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some demonstrators who had been arrested after the election were tortured to death in prison in August and others raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of a former detainee, who said that he had been detained in a container in a detention centre in Kahrizak with 75 others for more than eight weeks.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial authorities had set up a committee to investigate the unrest after the election and the government's reactions to it, but Amnesty said that the mandates and power of these bodies were unclear and that the results obtained by the parliamentary committees had not been published.
The group said that in the last three weeks at least 90 people were arrested to prevent further demonstrations.
Skihang was established in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a Bristol landmark into a competition track.
The ski slope of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump at the beginning of a 100 meter long slope.
The student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the slope, but it was also quite intimidating.
It is a great view with all the lights of the city glittering below.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some real talents."
Prizes were awarded for the best tricks on the slope.
After the event on Thursday evening, the snow is left to melt.
Still she and we
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters voted in favour of a construction ban for minarets and the concern about the alleged Islamization of Europe is widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a well-founded and well-considered report on whether Muslims can be integrated - and integrated into one of the most explicitly secularized societies in Europe.
Some readers will read this new book out of admiration for the author's last work: "Why the French don't love headscarves" (2006), an elegant and densely arguing study of a dispute that divided and occupied the country for more than a decade and whose effects are still perceptible today.
Bowen ’ s latest book offers a more comprehensive and bold spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he not only wants to know what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening in the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now offer the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls them "Islamic freedom".
He is a good listener, he gives back debates between teachers and students about the questions they are most concerned about.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use a interest-oriented banking system to get a mortgage?
They are these seemingly profane matters, he claims, which make up daily life, quite contrary to the political dramas that occupy the media.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a well-known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, an Arabic Muslim scholar and academician born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how it is possible to be a good Muslim on the one hand and a good citizen in a modern secular society on the other.
They do not have all the arguments on their side.
Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists who questioned Bowen are usually divided against their Salafi counterparts - advocates of the purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia - who today exhibit a small but influential presence among Europe's Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism may be compatible.
But an agreement requires giving and taking on both sides.
He questions the extent to which French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite who so passionately guard the separation of church and state) really feel obliged to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience rougher treatment than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, who in turn had to make their historic compromise with secular republicanism.
He rather recognizes a "tightening of the value screws" than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book one is inclined to say "Yes, but not yet".
The bleak view of the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice that characterizes it melts at alarming speed and takes life with it, which cannot survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have entered the recently open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors in their keel waters.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws in "On thin ice" (original title: "On Thin Ice") a natural history of the icon of the north, the polar bear.
In the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic researchers, who proved themselves in the hunt for polar bears.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with a polar bear as a brave fourteen-year-old ensign to the sea, who fought only with the rifle butt of his musket, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears caught as they swam behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were brought to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears at a performance.
Even today, zoo facilities still typically have one millionth of the life of a wild old animal. The climate is rarely suitable: The polar bear in Singapore was completely green from the algae that grow in the hollow hair of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters represent for the survival of the species.
Although prohibited in Norway, America, and Russia, cremation continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters use powerful assault rifles in helicopters and snowmobiles to take off their prey.
Ironically, the ice will remain the longest in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations.
In his new book "After the Ice" (original title "After the Ice"), Alun Anderson, a former editor of the science magazine "New Scientist", offers a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a gripping insight into how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of the changes.
But that is not because of a lack of explanatory attempts.
The pioneering journeys of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century led to the first glimpse of the swirling of the pack ice.
In the Cold War, underboats measured the shifting ridges while undertaking.
A useful supplement are satellite surveys and the large-scale application of measuring probes on icebergs, but still much is achieved by intrepid people who camp outside in the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the peculiar, tiny world of the inflow system within the Arctic ice formed by salt water troughs pressed together during freezing.
But, from the bear on the ice to the microscopically small miracles in the ice, all are threatened when the summer ice passes, which is calculated between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months... we could be"
Navy fanterists were among the 6,000 who laid wreaths in Arlington
The upper gefreite De'Angello Robinson travelled seven hours by bus to lay a single wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other naval fanciers who undertook the journey from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they have stepped.
In a few months, from whence we are always brought back, we could be that, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I would wish someone would do the same for me, so I try to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the tombs of veterans in several sections of the Arlington cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, owner of the Trauerkranzherstellers Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred graves in the cemetery in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who undertake this trip every year, stopping in various cities along the way to carry out events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across Amerika (wreaths throughout America), which has also extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 wreaths on the graves at the Arlington Cemetery, in areas at the Pentagon, on graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery and New York Park, and at the memorial site for the U.S. Airlines flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The Walmart Foundation donated more than 150,000 dollars for the purchase and transport of wreaths for the second time.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said that she made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a late professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way to give something back to those who brought sacrifices.
She said that this is a small contribution to how we civilians can support our soldiers.
It is like visiting a family tomb.
Packed in positions of warm clothing, the volunteers wandered across the vast lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had older graves from the first and second world wars and the Vietnam war as a goal, since these are not visited as often as the newer graves, so the organizers.
The atmosphere was cheerful, children played and couples held their hands while carrying the fresh pine branches to the gray gravestones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red ribbon attached to the upper part.
Section 60, which is nearby and where mainly veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained almost calm.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 wreaths to decorate this section, but the gloomy mood of the current wars filled this area.
Individuals cried openly, others prayed and families and friends held together in the icy air.
Some read loudly the names carved in stone before, while others bowed down to small black and white space cards, which had been put into the damp mud for those whose tombstones were not yet finished.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who shed bitter tears in front of her son's grave.
She has driven 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of naval frantery and non-commissioned officer David Shane Spicer, who fell in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free... my son paid for it, she said.
"If I have not been there for a long time, I want someone to remember him."
Contractors of the US Government of Cuban authorities arrested
The Cuban government has arrested a US government contractor selling mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, said State Department representatives on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for customers, such as USAID, the US Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials from the US Representation of Interest in Havana are trying to gain access to the detainee arrested on 5 December.
The special charges have not yet been published, although under Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything under the charge of "endangering".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, which include light protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and statements are regarded as a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger coalition led by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are being persecuted and attacked by government officials.
Sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to receive prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase tensions between the Castro ’ s Communist government in Cuba and Obama ’ s government, which had sought a “slow ” rapprochement to improve relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported Friday night by the New York Times.
The new US government policy attaches importance to the United States providing a return when the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after products in a country where the average income of a government employee is $15 per month.
The Cuban government has only allowed ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year, they are mainly used to send text messages, as a 15 minute call would cost a daily wage.
Internet use is extremely restricted on the island.
It is accessible in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government offices, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few US citizens who are in prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, the press spokesperson for the US Interest Representation in Havana.
Berbena said she could not give any further information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the release of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the group "Human Rights Watch", which recently published a hard report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, same Cuba", said a reference to the inauguration of Raul Castro as the leader of the country replacing the sick elder brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the accused were very often arrested, sentenced and imprisoned within a day.
He said that any solution would probably be political, and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative response in the United States, just at the time both countries move towards more dialogue.
Pakistani government officials uncover plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities discovered on Saturday a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US soldiers, saying that they hope this case could help uncover an extensive network of terrorist recruits seeking the Internet for radicalised young men.
Investigators said they had been looking for an opaque insurgent, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he had found them, because one of them had made YouTube's endorsing comments on terrorist attacks on the Internet.
Saifullah became the leader of these men after their arrival in Pakistan and tried to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is the home of Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camp.
But a representative of Pakistan ’ s secret service, who was informed about the matter, said on Saturday that Saifullah could not convince Al Qaeda ’ s leaders that the men are not part of a CIA ’ s conspiracy to undermine the terrorist network.
As a result, they were detained for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the inhospitable mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist refuge.
They were seen as part of a covert operation.
Therefore they were rejected, said the government official, who wanted to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said that the men were by no means discouraged and continued to try to get the right recommendations to gain access to Al Qaeda ’ s camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani prison authorities.
The case of the five men - who continue to be in Pakistan and interviewed by the FBI - underlines the crucial role of recruits in identifying future terrorists, and perhaps even more important, in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the US intelligence service has made it a matter of the utmost urgency to house human assets within Al Qaeda.
The recruits of the organization act as doormen who do not let in those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spies.
American would-be recruits are subjected to a special examination by A Qaeda, said analysts.
However, due to their potential access to US targets and propaganda value, they are also seen as immensely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, the highest analyst of the NEFA and based in the USA, said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years with regard to whom they allow access, because the US intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to inject someone into these groups, what better way to go than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is now based much more on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators call for climate action in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets here on Saturday and demanded that negotiators in the Bella Convention Centre of the city act boldly on climate protection.
Demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, whereas police estimates were about 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists lit small explosives near some government buildings in the city centre.
On a day when little happened in the UN-sponsored climate negotiations, thousands of activists migrated through the city with banners in English saying "There is no Planet B" and one in Spanish saying "The Earth says" Enough ".
Some stars joined the protest, for example the Danish model, the photographer Helena Christensen, who said that her travels to Peru, her mother ’ s birthplace, make her aware of the heartbreaking problems the country is facing due to the already noticeable effects of climate change.
This is part of the motives why I decided to take part in the great demonstration - to pass on the word and appeal to world leaders to bring about a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done now and there is no way to go about it.
The police stopped the demonstrators from coming too close to the Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because they were either masked or carried pocket knives.
Under Danish law, these actions are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a spectator who did not want to be called because he is involved in the climate negotiations, masked demonstrators in black clothing lit several explosives near the main channel in Copenhagen, near which there are several ministries.
They threw them near the buildings, he said and added that they started as light missiles, but then were followed by "a few big explosions".
Inside the Congress Centre, people gathered in front of TV screens to watch the demonstration throughout the afternoon.
But the protest apparently did not reach the consciousness of the main functionaries, such as Su Wie, China ’ s chief climate negotiator.
When he was asked whether he thought that the demonstration had a constructive effect on the international considerations, he replied in English: "This is something I was not aware of".
He then continued in Mandarin and said, "Because the venue is big, I can't hear what is happening outside."
He noted that it depends on the perspective of the individual whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on the topic of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "one can also say that they disturb the negotiations or the freedom of other people".
Examination data show persistent race cluster
The testimonials on mathematics performance last week were welcome good news for public schools in Washington D. C.
Although the Washington district is still far behind the country ’ s schools that produce top performances, evidence shows that the fourth- and eightth-graders have made more rapid progress in the past two years than cities that include Atlanta, Chicago, and New York.
But what is included in the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the persistent performance gap between African-American and white students, both at the local and national levels.
The average score of the white fourth-grader from Washington D. C. rose in the last two years from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their African-American peers rose by only three points from 209 to 212.
The performance gap actually rose from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the Afro-American eight-grades remained basically the same, falling by a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white students was not included in the test data, as the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is no more encouraging either.
The gap that separated white and black fourth-graders in 2003, when the first NAEP was recorded in this district, was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the score that children of both groups have reached has increased in this period, the difference with now 58 points has hardly diminished.
Some of the district ’ s educational advocates expressed their concern last week that the results celebrated by school Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and Democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty were largely driven by white students who are already powerful children.
This suggests that we have raised the overall score by treating those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, D.C. Voice ’ s board member, a non-profit group advocating equal education in Washington DC.
I do not jump up and down for a span of two or three points, said the Democratic Washington City Council member, Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Eaton's primary school.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee ’ s management style, said that the message of the exam score is that the city ’ s secondary schools need urgent attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, I respect that.
What frightens me, however, is that we do not spend nearly the time and energy we need to use for our secondary school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of poor students.
This autumn, for example, some teachers will be trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson and Lese system, which aims at pupils in the upper classes of primary and secondary schools, which have not mastered basic skills of reading at the beginning of their school careers and which lie significantly behind their peers.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum that focuses on games and lifelike experiences from kindergarten to sixth grade, was brought to Washington under former senior school inspector Clifford Janey, and some of the NAEP ’ s progress reported last week is attributed to this curriculum.
I believe that we must continue to work to ensure that the best measures are taken to benefit students below the grade level, said Rhee.
Others say that NAEP ’ s results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system, while continuing to provide the extra money and resources to low-performing schools that are needed to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, who investigates urban testing results.
The conventional remedy is to direct its resources and management reforms to schools located in the poorest areas of Washington D.C..
The objective could lead to political repercussions that work against this important item on the agenda.
The weak point is, of course, as with other urban school inspectors, that they are trying to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the neighbourhoods so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, who is now school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements of closing the performance gap is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, to compete with the charter schools.
One has to increase the school year to approximately 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teacher union last year over 185 days a year, which he regards as "a milestone" on the way to a greater increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than future prospects
The coach reaches the Gettysburg College with a loud whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, gets out and flashes a moment at the sight of the white columns, the brick facades and the emerald green lawn.
Graciela ’ s parents have barely completed high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was rescued in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and that of the other eight-graders of the group, who explore Gettysburg, where the tuition costs 38,690 dollars per year, was rather that of a reverent visitor than that of an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes! I'll be here soon!" cried Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the leader announced that they had now entered the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she said thoughtfully when the low professor was reported to her about the student relationship of the school.
The College in Pennsylvania was the 7th that the children visited on their three-day tour and now they have fully received the intended message: The question is not whether to go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of US-born children of Hispanic immigrants who do not end high school or become pregnant as teenagers, but on the other hand there are also hundreds of thousands who receive the college education needed to move to the middle class.
In reality, one in five of Hispano-American ’ s “second generation ” closes the college – which is a remarkable achievement, as many of their immigrated parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the US without having completed high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country ’ s workforce.
Those who study powerful children say that they often have a natural affinity for school and an intrinsic drive to success.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But advisory programmes also play a major role by helping Graciela and millions of children like them to come to college, especially if these efforts persist over a longer period of time.
When looking at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them find their way through the system, a single measure will not solve the problem at any time, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California in Davis, who studied Hispano-American students.
We need to think about providing these children with a supportive network from preschool to high school.
The federal program that Gracielas College has financed is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - Get up a gear - and provides more than 300 million dollars per year for local school systems to start college preparation programs that start when low-income students are in high school and continue running until they have completed high school.
According to the US Department of Education, the programme has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, more than 60% of whom went to college.
Iraqi Ministry of Oil concludes contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to cause major oil companies to rebuild its damaged infrastructure at two auctions concluded on Saturday.
The 10 agreements concluded with foreign oil companies by the Iraqi Oil Ministry suggest that China, Russia, and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been paralyzed by war and economic sanctions for decades.
American companies could only register shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven American companies had paid for participation in the second auction, which started on Friday.
The only company that made a bid has withdrawn the shorter ones.
Two American companies were able to sign contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The analysts surprised the thinly sown representatives of American oil multinationals in opening up the Iraqi oil industry.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after 6 years of war, and instead of US companies, Asian and European are leading the way, said Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online intelligence service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns, highlighted by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability caused by the withdrawal of the US military, have probably prevented American oil companies from engaging more strongly in Iraq, which has the world ’ s third largest proven crude oil reserves.
US companies were disadvantaged in some cases because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not have to hold shareholders accountable.
Exxon's Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that could conclude contracts with the ministry.
Larger US companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained close relations with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and have been assisting with technical advice in recent years, have gone out empty.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts promised this weekend.
The state China National Petroleum Corporation has offered for more contracts than any other company and could go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said the spokesman for the Oil Ministry, Assam Jihad, that China is on its way to becoming one of the big players in the world economy and a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can compete with its competitors and will fulfil its obligations to Iraq.
For the bid levy pre-selected companies gave bids, which were then compared with the fee per barrel of oil, which the ministry was willing to pay to increase the output of each field beyond the current level.
Al Qaeda ’ s top planners apparently killed in Pakistan
In an obvious US missile attack along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan, an al-Qaeda Top Operations Planner was said to have been killed this week, US counter-terrorism officials reported on Friday.
If it were confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on a senior terrorist organisation this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who, according to US sources and Pakistani government officials, were said to have been killed by a number of rockets that hit their vehicle near the city of Miran Shah in the northern province of Waziristan on Tuesday.
Local authorities reported that the rockets were fired from a type of drone used by the CIA in Pakistan ’ s lawless tribal belt.
They drove in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, a Pakistani civil intelligence official from Miran Shah said by telephone.
Local residents suspected of belonging to the militants ran to the place and quickly took everything that was left of the "completely destroyed bodies".
The local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the US counter-terrorism led indefinite evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as a leading military planner of Al Qaeda, which led operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan region of Pakistan.
He was involved in conspiracy around the world, noted a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous, pointing to the delicate character of the US air strikes on Pakistani soil.
By assuming its central role as given, this included planning attacks against the US and Europe.
He accepted strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al Qaeda and implemented them in operational planning for possible terrorist attacks.
The second American official said that Somali quickly rose in Al Qaeda ’ s hierarchy and maintained best ties with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, said the second official, but this does not reduce the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If his death were confirmed, Somali would be the second leading Al Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September when Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other top activists were killed in a similar attack.
The pace of attacks by CIA drones has decreased since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website maintained by a non-profit organization, from an average of six operations per month to two.
The decline can be based on improved terrorist group tactics, which have taken steps to reduce their attackability while brutally killing suspected informants, the page reported.
Leading UN envoy in Kabul will resign
The UN ’ s leading envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from office in March, putting an end to a stormy term of office tarnished by allegations of widespread corruption in the Afghan presidential election supported by the UN.
The Obama administration decided to send another 30,000 US soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that he supported the increase in the troops, but he also expressed his concern that the US Military Withdrawal Schedule, which is to begin in 18 months, could induce other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the development of the Afghan security forces, sending the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, said Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul.
Commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian helpers helping Afghanistan ’ s political transition.
The military increase must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he did not resign, but only fulfilled an agreement to his family in March 2008 to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted the notification to UNO-
Secretary-General Ban Kimoon is now passing on so that he has time to provide a replacement.
What I said is that he is better off looking for a successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has started a search for a replacement according to UN representatives.
The UN representatives say that he has considered the Swedish resident Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN's mission to Baghdad, and the French Jean Marie Guéhenno, who previously headed UN's peace operations.
Oath ’ s position in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of preferring President Hamid Karzai in the country ’ s presidential election and covering up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide rejected all accusations, but he also said that Galbraith's accusations - which was fired - "have undoubtedly done harm to the mission because there was already a great deal of scepticism about international interference in the election."
Eide said he recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the relief operations of the American-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow its successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries donating to the Afghan mission, and said that this would strengthen their confidence in using their money properly.
Oath expressed his disappointment at limiting his forces in Afghanistan, saying that the cumbersome UN hiring arrangements have undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed in such a way that since May, he said, I could hire only one person.
This is disastrous and must not continue.
US Defence Minister Gates: Iran must expect additional sanctions
Defense Minister Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because he has not participated in talks about his nuclear plans.
Gates spoke on a 7-day trip through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq to a group of about 300 US soldiers in northern Iraq and downplayed the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran, there are no good choices, he said in response to a soldier ’ s question about the likelihood of such a development.
"One of the things on my soul, if we have learned something from Iraq in the last six years, is the unpredictability of war."
The Obama administration is considering a sanction package aimed at Iran ’ s military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average siranian.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is needed "to convince the Iranian Government that it is in fact less protected by nuclear weapons" because "its people will suffer tremendously" from the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, the American government joined the European leaders in warning that Iran must expect "credible" consequences if it does not comply with the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear surveillance organisation, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran continues to maintain that knowledge of nuclear technology should only be gained for peaceful purposes.
During talks in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said it would resume talks on restricting its nuclear programme and renounce a substantial part of its stock of enriched uranium in exchange for much-needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The US government has pressed for this kind of agreement to build confidence between the two parties and gain time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to have left the negotiations on the provisional agreements -- to some extent, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided on whether they should commit to the United States.
The fact that Iran simply left the international community standing in relation to some of the proposals they had already agreed at the beginning of October has, frankly, brought together the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, in a way that they have never been associated with important additional sanctions for Iran, said Gates.
President Obama set December 31 as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before pursuing other options, including those once called “oppressive sanctions ” by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.
In a statement delivered in New York, the Iranian mission to the United Nations condemned what it called on Thursday "groundless and unfounded claims" of some Security Council members to Iranian nuclear activities and said that they are prepared to continue the talks with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve an appropriate long-term solution".
Gates, who was supposed to return to Washington last Friday, met Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq for meetings with the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish authorities in Irbil.
Tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq remain high, particularly in terms of borders, property rights, and the distribution of public revenue.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict in order to prevent delays in US plans to reduce US force strength from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to dispel Kurdish concern about the impending withdrawal of troops. US officials cited Gates, who said to Masud Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government, "We will maintain your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you. "
A Change in China ’ s Older Course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that gave them lectures that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain more children" and "A baby more means a grave more".
These lessons they learned so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, who suddenly began to change the course this summer due to the low birth rate and the ageing population, and encouraged young couples to have more than one child, their response was immediate and final: "Not at all."
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
There is nothing left for a second child, said Wang, 31, a head of staff with an 8-month old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the One Child policy in China, which has produced two generations of notoriously thick, outdated single children, affectionately called "little emperors", is causing a population crisis in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time when this policy entered into force, the UN
The Department for Population Issues is expected to explode from 16.7% of the population by 2050 to 31.1% from 60 years of age and older in 2020, well above the global average of around 20%.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60 year-olds and older people identified almost 22 percent of Shanghai ’ s registered residents, while the birth rate was below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Mission, said that couples of productive age need to get babies to "help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and alleviate the labor shortage of the future."
Shanghai will soon be "so old -- but not as rich -- as developed countries like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual relaxation
enshrined in the country ’ s constitution in 1978, China ’ s One Child Policy is likely to be the most controversial order introduced by the ruling Communist Party to this day.
Couples who violate this policy must face enormous fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some regions -- and discrimination in their jobs.
Chinese officials have attributed it to this policy that the critical use of natural resources could be avoided, while human rights representatives have condemned abuses in the enforcement of policies.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women who have already had a child to rub off.
Many couples also had sex selective abortions carried out, resulting in an unnaturally high relationship between men and women.
In recent years, government officials for populations have gradually weakened their stance on One Child Policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities, and cases where both husband and wife were single children -- and in 2007, the tone of many harsh slogans was mitigated.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Beijing University Institute of Population Research, said that government officials have recently even discussed more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children with whom a partner is a single child.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births in July.
Posters that taught families to have only one child were replaced almost overnight by guidelines that describe in detail who is eligible for a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration has sent out municipal employees and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and to push through information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice to those who have more than one child.
The reaction was not encouraging, said family planning officials.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the outskirts of Shanghai said that an upswing can be seen in the applications of couples who want a second child after the launch of the campaign, the urban districts do not report any change.
In the municipality of Huinan with a population of 115,000, only four to five applications are still received per month as an example.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births expected in the city in 2010 will still be around 165,000 -- slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Shanghai community of Caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to give their first the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and that they would be legally permitted.
But, like many Chinese, they have only a small government health and life insurance.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West erroneously rate the One Child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yes, we are deprived of the opportunity to have more than one child.
But the problem is not simply a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the Human Resources Manager, said she wanted only one child because she was also a single child. "We were the center of the family and used to care for each one of us.
We are not used to taking care of others and do not really want to. "
Chen Zijian, a 42 year old to whom a translation company belongs, said it more bluntly.
For parents from the middle class with double careers, through which the birth rate decreases, he said, it turns to be successful and for this one must be selfish.
The age group of today ’ s 20- to 39-year-olds grew up struggling to see their parents fight during the early days of China ’ s capitalism experiment, and they don ’ t want such a life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, places huge demands on the time of parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there is the question of space -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and life planning -- "When the child is 9 months old, you must already have a CV for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are willing to go through this once, said Chen, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to reach a higher standard of living, he said.
We do not want to make too many sacrifices.
UN Group drafts emission reduction plan
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- which has so far been characterised by wild poses and mutual accusations -- has again focused on Friday with the publication of a document that records an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with industrial nations having to shoulder the greatest burdens in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a definitive political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, showed both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But it has been seen as an important step forward in a negotiation that takes the time, with more than 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week.
The text, formulated by a specially created UN working group, is silent on the money supply that rich countries should give to poor countries so that they can master global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how advanced and large emerging economies can limit their carbon emissions, and how high the upper limit of the global temperature increase that policymakers would support.
The process is given great flexibility, said John Coequyt, senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who designed the six-page document, has summarised a 180 page negotiating text to focus on what the UN ’ s leading climate protection representative, Yvo de Boer, called “the big whole. ”
It shows the outline of a possible agreement whereby industrialised nations would jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45% by 2020, compared to 1990 limits, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30% in the same period.
Together, countries could cut emissions by 50 to 95% by 2050.
The European Community has also given the talks on Friday a boost through its commitment to provide US $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change, from the master of floods and droughts to the prevention of deforestation.
Friday nevertheless brought the same verbal fireworks that had determined the talks last week.
The American climate mentor Todd Stern has rejected formulations calling for binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for developed countries, compared with voluntary reductions for major emerging economies, if they are not financed by developed nations.
This train announced that the Obama administration is heading a harder line with China than representatives of the Bush administration did not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without larger emerging economies getting up and taking action, said Stern, who also complained that the text was not going far enough to ensure that the cuts could be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern gave his opinion one hour after the statement by China ’ s Deputy Secretary of State He Yafei, which said that the leading American climate negotiator was either lacking “reason ” or“ most irresponsible ” of him, saying earlier this week that the United States would not help China financially to master global warming.
By jeopardising the future economic direction of the world ’ s major powers, fault lines have opened up both within industrialized nations and between industrialized nations and emerging economies.
The current struggle relates equally to the rescue of individual economies, as well as to the rescue of the planet, with China and the United States committing themselves to their obligations, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take more courageous action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the major powers are fighting to see who should bear the cost of halting greenhouse gas emissions, as even affected countries have moved to take more aggressive action to hold the countries with very high greenhouse gas levy accountable for their actions.
This is clearly a game from which a new economic supremacy will develop, says Ulate, who also works as a regional climate change consultant for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most exposed to the effects of climate change said they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the talks will at best lead to a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, with 43 members, tabled a 24-page draft treaty early Friday morning.
Artur Runge's butcher, who heads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the small island states' offensive 'exerts political pressure on the whole political process', partly because they are now united and demand measures from emerging countries, such as China and India.
The talks were given a new urgency when the delegates focused on the fact that most of the outstanding questions had to be resolved before the arrival of the leaders in order to reach an agreement.
High-level representatives, such as India ’ s Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and China ’ s Vice Minister, stepped out of their aircraft and raced through the corridors of the Bella Center for meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to mark out claims that will be negotiated next week.
The mere extent of the meeting -- 13,000 people go to the Congress Centre every day, and guitar-playing activists do nightly shows in which they make fun of the countries that they think betray and sell, and draft contracts are passed on from hand to hand rather than via e-mail -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is just building up: almost all important ministers are here now and from Wednesday, 60 government leaders will be in Copenhagen.
We come to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice President for Global Policy of the Organization Conservation International.
The heavy weights come.
Great Britain ’ s first 225 km / h fast train redefines the Monday feeling
Monday morning at 5: 13 a.m., a whistle will penetrate the darkness to announce a train ride that represents a revolution in traffic in Britain.
The first high-speed passenger train in the country will reach 225 km / h on its lightning flight from Ashfort, Kent, to London St. Pancras and drive 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will be on board the first Javelin commuter service from London.
He hopes that the new UK service will eventually connect to an international rail network of fast, reliable trains and link the major metropolitan areas of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become lively commuter cities, labor travel times would be radically reduced, and the change of plane and car to rail would reduce national carbon emissions and congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds that are needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears about environmental damage could still be braking British high-speed railways.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to present a feasibility study to the government, Lord Adonis, according to the Times, will present the report on December 30.
This gives it a detailed map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will pass five metres of urban areas and places where environmental impacts are controversial.
In the open area, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final route.
HS2 should also create three options for a larger, north-leading high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond in spring.
The preferred option is a Y-shaped route, where a single high-speed route would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would divide in or near Birmingham and a branch would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another in northeast direction to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best working option," said a railroad insider.
After completion, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow travellers to travel the London Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared to a little over an hour today.
The draft would allow trains to travel at a speed of 400 km / h, making the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first route was planned in such a way that 400 meters long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 persons can drive on it.
Up to 18 trains could be in operation per hour on the London Birmingham line.
This, in turn, would mean that a terminal station would be needed in London where 20,000 passengers could be handled per hour.
Given the geographical constraints in the capital, it is expected that an existing station would be developed to accommodate the high-speed network.
Bahnexperten say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will indicate whether he believes that this plan should be continued or not, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will only be taken after the parliamentary elections.
But even if it sets the wheels in motion, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains would first have to switch from high-speed lines to existing rail lines in the north of Birmingham, leaving travel time between London and Scotland at more than three hours.
This is seen as a crucial crux for ensuring a change from plane to train, a guideline for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers come up for mortgage for 75,000 pounds of conservative orangery
Alan Duncan, the conservative ’ s leading under-house member, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orangery that he built in his home in his constituency.
The Party ’ s prison spokesman, who was degraded by David Cameron because he complained that Unterhaus members have to live "from meager rations", has increased his mortgage by 75,000 pounds in order to have an oak factory building built at his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer the additional interest, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The people in charge of the House of Commons approved the applications at the time and they were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out a review of the expenses of the members of the House of Commons. Last night Duncan said that the applications could not have been "cleaner or more comprehensible".
Duncan, one of the richest Unterhaus members, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have achieved a purchase price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Fees Office, an expenditure control center of the lower house, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he cultivated a conservatory called "orangery" in the plans.
Neighbours described him as a "glasshouse for entertainment".
During a recent investigation of his previous mortgage contracts by the Committee on Standards and Privileges, Duncan was not asked to comment on increased borrowing.
The Committee acquitted him of breaking the rules last month after an investigation into his expenditure.
In 2004 Duncan transferred the security for a mortgage of £271,406 (EUR 300,000) from his London house to his constituency house, which he bought in 1991, a year before his election as a member of parliament.
This week published documents show that Duncan received about £1,400 (€1,500) per month as mortgage interest refunded by March last year.
In April, his claims rose to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
The interest rate of Duncan's RBS mortgage has not changed during this period, suggesting that the total increase served to finance the borrowing of 75,000 pounds (85,000 euros).
The normal infinitely variable RBS mortgage rate fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, where it is still standing.
The latest documents published by the House of Commons show that Duncan continued to claim his right to £1,250 (€1,400) per month this May.
Duncan lost his position as opposition leader of the House of Commons in September, after an undercover reporter filmed him when he said after the expenditure scandal that members of parliament would "live on meager rations."
"Essentially, working for the state means having to live on lean rations and being treated as S * * * * * e."
He said, "I have spent my money on my garden, and I am entitled to a disappearing small portion, measured by what belongs.
And I could have claimed the whole damned sum, but I don't. "
The MP, a millionaire from his earlier career as an oil wholesaler, was attacked for the first time in May for his expenditure when it became clear that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden before he had clarified with the Fees Office that this could "be regarded as an exaggerated demand."
As a protest in Duncan ’ s lawn, an activist dug a hole in the form of a pound drawing after it became known that he had claimed 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) over three years.
When he was asked last night about the increased mortgage, Duncan said, "This had been approved by the Fees Office, as well as subsequently by Legg for an increase in value."
He added: "There is no debate about dodging and tapping, or about bending the rules or the like.
Everything is perfectly transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It could not be cleaner and clearer. "
Come all of you believers to admire Brightons Beach Cabins Advent Calendar
Beach cottages in Brighton have found a new livelihood for the winter months as an interactive advent calendar.
"Beyond", an alternative group of churches that encourages spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts with Christmas carols for each December day.
The event started on December 1st and visitors were allowed to watch the latest hut every day from 5: 30 pm to 6: 30 pm with free mulled wine and traditional mince pies filled with dried fruits.
The Christmas carols selected so far are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël", where the hut decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV Marketing Assistant from Hove, is an honorary clergyman of the Diocese of Chichester and head of Beyond.
He said: "We want to make religion more important for people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we as a church expect people to come to a strange old building? I think the church should go to people and organize exciting celebrations.
The idea of a beach hut Advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and lively place and we try to express this through our spirituality. "
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated worldwide and in Copenhagen on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against climate change, where the police have arrested hundreds.
At least thirty thousand people according to police, hundreds of thousands according to the organizers, have marched in the cold of the Danish capital, on the margins of the United Nations Climate Change Conference, which should lead to a conclusion by Friday, which could enter into force from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish President of the Climate Conference, the increasing mobilisation in the world for the climate contributes to what is illustrated by these demonstrations that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place a short time after the train passed, when a group of 300 demonstrators, dressed in black, broke window with pavement stones and hammers, a journalist from AFP noted.
Anti-unrest policemen have intervened immediately and without consideration.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people, mainly members of the Black Blocs, have been arrested in the east of France, in April, by these extremely violent groups of fragments that have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has sharply criticised the conditions under which hundreds of militant supporters had been arrested "without distinction", and has underlined that about a hundred of them "were still held in the streets on Saturday evening", despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and in-sitting position.
The rather peaceful train went from Parliament towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to enter.
A stage was installed to welcome the designated speakers, for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the demonstrators have arrived from the major European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, as well as some Africans.
Approximately 3,000 people, most of them with sky-blue raincoats, have made a first run in the morning in Copenhagen, as they have followed the call of the friends of the earth "to form blue tides" for the "climate justice".
Today we are going to the streets to demand redress for the ecological debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a filippine activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot go on like that and say to ourselves: we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry out, watercourses where you can walk, as it has never been in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, established in 1992 with the adoption of the UN agreement, the movement of globalization critics has approached environmental organizations.
European MP José Bové, figure of the globalisation critics, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice": "Today there are no differences between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world."
The Asian Pacific region, where there are many islands that are particularly vulnerable as a result of warming, has given the starting shot for the demonstrations.
Approximately 50,000 people went to the streets according to the organizers in Australia.
In Manila there were several hundreds of people, mostly students, who marched in red and hoisted Bandanas, where they praised the solar energy.
In Hong Kong or in Djakarta, but also in Canada, several hundred demonstrators held marches to demand a vigorous approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" have gathered several hundred people, namely in Paris, in Marseille (south), in Lille (north), in Bordeaux (west) and in Lyon (east).
Some people gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia elected its president, Georgia denounced that this was a "coup".
Abkhazia has elected its president on Saturday, this happened a little more than a year after Moscow had recognized this per-Russian separatist Georgian territory as independent, Tbilisi denounced the "coup".
Approximately 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russian Georgian war of August 2008 for control of the South Ossetian area, another Georgian secessionist area that was recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17 GMT.
The turnout amounted to about 58% a few hours before the local election was closed, according to the Abkhazian election commissioners.
The first preliminary results should be announced at night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the previous president, Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, the Georgian President Mikheil Saakachvili regrets that Abkhazia is now under complete occupation, explained his press spokesperson, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, only Nikaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as a part of Georgia, which is occupied by Russia in terms of silver.
Having separated from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, with several thousands of people dying, Abkhazia wants to prove through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era as an independent state, declared Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54 year-old historian who claims to have elected Mr Bagapch.
She was one of the voters who went to vote in a polling station, which was located in a school in the capital Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the Black Sea.
Great signs on which Bagapch can be seen alongside the Russian president and the head of government, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are everywhere in this small area that has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, located in the east of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the conduct of the elections.
We, the Abkhazian people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as an allusion to the support of Moscow, especially with regard to the decision to recognise Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognised by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, raising a glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition, represented by the former Vice President and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticised the agreements reached with Moscow last year, as the one in which Abkhazia leaves Russia to control the railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims not to support either the current government or the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is necessary to win the election.
If none of the candidates reaches this limit, a second round of elections must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demos Worldwide, Incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated throughout the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding treaty from the Copenhagen climate conference, where the police, at any time ready to deploy, arrested about 700 people on the edge of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people according to the police, hundreds of thousands according to the organizers have demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which receives by December 18 the delegates from 193 countries, who are looking for an agreement, which is to enter into force on January 1, 2013.
From Parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the center and did not try to penetrate.
A stage was set up to welcome the intended speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
Some moments after the train had passed, a group of demonstrators dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammered, began beating discs, a journalist from AFP noted.
Anti-unrest policemen have encircled you immediately and have intervened without regard by throwing some of you on the ground.
The police have announced that between 600 and 700 people have been arrested and made it clear that they are mainly members of the Black Blocs, these extremely violent factions that have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
Towards evening, during the incidents in which, according to the police, about twenty people were temporarily arrested, a police officer suffered an injury to the chin from a cobblestone. Four vehicles burned near a occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups under control," said Henrik Jakobsen, spokesman for the police, while the helicopters of the police were circling in the air.
Most of the demonstrators travelling by train or by car from major German cities, London, Amsterdam or Milan, were Europeans.
But there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in the sky blue raincoat, formed in the morning in Copenhagen after the call of the "Friends of the Earth" to a first group, which should represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice".
"Today we are taking to the streets to demand that the ecological debt be repaid to the people of the South," said activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can no longer say: we still have time," says singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa there are rivers that run dry, there are rivers through which you can walk, which was never the case before."
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of anti-globalization has approached environmental organisations.
The French MEP and globalization critic José Bové told AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "combine climate justice and social justice." "There is no longer a difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The Oxfam organization has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who turn to the masses.
The Asian Pacific region, where there are many islands that are particularly vulnerable to global warming, has given the impetus to the demonstrations.
In Australia, about 50,000 people have taken to the streets, according to the organizers.
In Manila, several hundred people, in the majority of students, dressed in red with bandanas, made advertising in front of the municipality of the Philippine capital for solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Djakarta, hundreds of demonstrators have also gathered in an action against climate change.
In France, during the demonstrations organised by the "network of 350", several hundred people joined forces, in particular in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
According to Chatel, the subjects of geography and history emerge strengthened from the school reform of the Lycéen.
In an interview published in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche", the National Minister of Education Luc Chatel explained that the subjects of geography and history emerge stronger from the school reform of the Lycéen, even if they are not compulsory taught in the terminals (12th school year).
"The students of the Première (11th school year) now have the same program every four hours a week," Mr. Chatel confirms.
For the minister, "this hypocrisy must be overcome", because according to him, "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but rather, on the whole, a concentration of "the best students."
"The economic social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of science," he continued. He underlined: "I have not yet heard many historians and intellectuals who have been outraged by the lack of historical geographical education in the terminals on technical lyceae."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in the Humanité revealed that almost seven out of ten French (69%) criticize the state project of cancelling compulsory teaching in history and geography at Terminale S (12th school year with scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also criticised this project, as well as the left and some right-wing representatives.
The minister replied that there was no question of limiting the philosophy of the program of terminals.
Luc Chatel also defended the education reform for teachers, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for a protest against the project for Tuesday, which she believes is the victim of the educational training of future teachers.
The Minister stated that they undergo a professional aptitude test in Master 2 (M2) at the beginning of the year and an admission examination at the end of the year in which their teaching skills are examined.
They also carry out internships during the year in the M2 and then teach one year before the students as teachers in the internship.
He also said, "If you add all the internships offered before the performance test, you will reach even more hours spent in front of the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
Finally, the Minister stated that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - a "thing that does not exist in the education sector."
He confirmed once again that he wanted to abolish the school card "until 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normale Supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the deployment at the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, had to face on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normale Supérieure on Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
As a journalist from AFP noted, Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, where experts turn to the audience for fifteen minutes each with films.
Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organizers of this day, said on the fringes of the conference that one wants to do something to reach the people and give them the feeling of wanting to learn more. The name of this event goes back to the name that the students gave to the fish in the basin of the school.
"Among the experts were selected around the twenty discussion participants, even after their charisma," he specifies.
"One can speak for hours about climate warming, but the core goals can also be set out in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of AFP, who spoke freely in front of about 50 people only with the help of slides.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he underlined in the hope that the listeners may derive from the fact that "the Copenhagen Conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos shot by these conferences will be available online on the school page from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will take place every two months afterwards.
Late payment: angry prison guards, actions planned
On Friday, the prison officials' unions called for a general day of action to ensure that the premiums and overtime paid for budgetary reasons until January are transferred before Christmas holidays.
The second union of the prison officers ("FO Pénitentiaire") called on the employees who do not have a service to demonstrate in front of the prison on Tuesday morning and to block them in order to draw attention to the "theft of what is due to them".
The Third Criminal Officers' Union (CGT) called for "a strong mobilization in the various prisons", on which the non-payment of overtime, night surcharges and Sunday and holiday supplements in December will be branded as "shameful and unacceptable".
The first union of prison officers, the Autonomous Federal Criminal Court Union (UFAP / UNSA), called for "general mobilizations (...) to show dissatisfaction and anger."
The head of the Penitentiary and the Ministry of Justice said that overtime increased sharply in 2009 and that not all of them were in the budget. However, they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice announced on the evening, Michèle Alliot and Marie sent a letter to the unions of the prison officers which guarantees that the payment will take place next month.
"I am well aware of the staff's efforts to keep our penal system functioning and to modernise it," the Minister of Justice said in this letter.
"I have instructed the head of the detention centre to take immediate action so that such a situation, which has arisen as a result of a lack of assessment of overtime, will not be repeated in the future," she added.
This means that the December wage is lean, except for the management staff, who benefit from high service and target premiums, explains the UFAP / UNSA, for which the "budgetary constraints" have to be maintained.
"This is an absolute scandal", the interregional trade union FO in Marseille outrages and announces boycotting "all meetings and conventions" up to new orders.
"The staff does not go to work on Sundays and public holidays, if the hours of October in December are still not paid. That also applies to their overtime", threatens also the FO Rhône and Alpes and Auvergne.
"At a time when more and more tasks are being imposed on us without employing more staff, the attempt to enrich the money of the staff is more than inadequate," said the Bordeaux CGT union.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions; some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, stated the Secretary-General of the UFAP, Jean-François Forget.
Obama believes he always distributes better gifts than he gets himself.
The American president, Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas with his family in the White House for the first time, has dissatisfied with the TV leader ’ s talk master Oprah Winfrey, that he always distributes better gifts than he gets himself.
During a special show broadcast on the ABC channel on Sunday evening, the president and his wife Michelle gave an insight into how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrem home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, will be part of the game.
"Santa Claus also loves Bo", Michelle Obama confirms and adds that the dog naturally also gets a gift.
Michelle Obama decidedly rejected her husband ’ s claims about the quality of the gifts. “I made you beautiful gifts last year, ” she teases the president.
"So please," he conjured her mischievously and pointed to the pearl chain of the First Lady: "And who gave you this one?"
During this one-hour broadcast in an informal atmosphere with the well-known television presenter whom Barack Obama had so vehemently supported during his campaign, the President and his wife also talked about gifts they had loved most as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a bicycle with ten courses and also a basketball, which his father, whom he saw very rarely, had brought him from Kenya for Christmas.
"I remember when my father visited us at Christmas and brought me a basketball," said the President.
"Only much later in my life did I understand that I had this ball from him."
The First Lady remembered her doll's house.
"I didn't know how to arrange the furniture in a house, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace, but I loved this little doll's house," Michelle Obama told.
Johnny Hallyday re-operated, RTL confirms that he was put into an artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was again operated on in Los Angeles for considerable "damage" after an operation in France. According to the surrounding persons, the situation is "under control", although RTL confirms that the singer was put into an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66 year-old rock musician was re-operated at the hospital of Cedars Sinaï in Los Angeles the night from Wednesday to Thursday, after the American doctors had found "damage caused by the operation of a herniated disc incident", which he had suffered in Paris on 26 November, according to his production company in Paris, which added that these damages had necessitated another operation.
The production company of the singer nevertheless wanted to clarify that the situation was "under control" and announced that a new medical opinion would be available in 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL, the partner during the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
Only after 48 hours, however, one had a little more certainty about the patient ’ s condition than he opened his eyes, RTL added.
On demand from AFP, there was neither a confirmation nor a comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "from certain sources", that after his first operation in Paris "no duress" was laid.
The rocker had been operated in the international clinic of Parc Monceau because of an intervertebral disc incident.
The procedure, which was planned for several days, was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known physician who had already treated many stars.
This was not available for comments on RTL on Thursday evening.
After Johnny Hallyday ’ s operation, the singer was hospitalized at Cedars Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday for a follow-up infection after the operation.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, felt to RTL on Thursday that his friend was just going through a "deep valley". He assured, however, that one had to "not worry" about the rock musician, since he was "a good fighter".
"He had called me before he departed for Los Angeles. I told him that it was nonsense to put himself in an airplane for twelve hours after such an operation, that would not be possible," said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer ’ s producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday “reacts well to the antibiotics ” and that“ the infection is contained ”.
Mr Camus also said that he spoke to Laeticia, the singer ’ s wife, and he did not feel any particular concern.
Nevertheless, the concern for the singer ’ s health had grown ever greater since he had spent nine days in a hospital in July after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, the general astonishment was that Johnny Hallyday had a "small colorectal cancer", which resulted in a slight infection.
At the end of September the singer recorded his long "Tour 66" as a farewell tour.
Since then, however, every health problem has been commented extensively. Fans and journalists have not escaped the fact that the singer had trouble moving on stage.
It was not until mid-November that the people surrounding him had to deny a new hospital delivery.
Euros 2009 / Short track: First place for Bousquet about his favorite distance
The Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, triple medal winner at the 2009 World Swimming Championships, won an international title on Thursday about his favourite distance, 50m Freestyle, at the Euros 2009 on the short track in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, on which polyurethane suits were allowed for the last time, there were only three world records, while a true record flood was expected.
A record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m layers and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50m layers of men.
A pity for Bousquet, who wanted to grab the world record for the 50m freestyle, whose record he holds in the big pool (20.94).
At one of the two royal distances in swimming, 50m of freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman claimed himself in 20.53 sec, in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually there are eight) - a premiere on an international level.
Bousquet defeated the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"One can believe in ever greater things, and in this case I said that if the world record is within my reach, I will try."
Like Bousquet almost all swimmers started in polyurethane suits, which are forbidden from 1 January 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their epic in Istanbul, which began in the same competition in 1999 for the first time.
The use of the combination did not pay off this time for the German Paul Biedermann, twice world champion in the pelvis this summer in Rome and world record, in the end.
The young swimmer has not managed to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3: 32.77), yet he has prevailed with the second best time in his career (3: 34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3: 35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3: 36.82).
"I didn't give everything this time.
I knew I couldn't achieve a world record today, but I defended my title and fulfilled my task. "
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," said Biedermann.
USA: Tomb plate at Zola estimated at 1.5 million US dollars
According to art dealer Sotheby, a Roman tomb plate, which appeared to the French writer Emile Zola of all places, was estimated at 1.5 million US dollars above its value on Thursday.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It dates back to the 3rd century AD and has always been valued at 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
The marble on which "four scenes of Dionysus are depicted in a sophisticated architectural decor surrounded by satyrs and Bacchus figures is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," Florent Heintz, vice-president of the auction of Roman and Egyptian antiques at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold among hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still ongoing, but this part is certainly what the buyers have offered the most," says Sotheby's spokesman, Dan Abernethy, to AFP.
The discovery of this purchase of the marble part by Emile Zola goes far back.
The record was at home in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borghese family, after which she appeared piece by piece with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who used it in her bathroom of her Paris hotel and with Paul Reynaud, Minister in the III. French Republic and President of the Council, before Marshal Pétain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
When searching through the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this record was part of a "Heritage of Emile Zola", which was opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon Trudeau Macquart".
Zelaya's trip from Honduras to Mexico has been thwarted
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of overthrown Honduras President Manuel Zelaya to domestic soil incompatible after the coup ’ s government had rejected him as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya at night, everything seems to indicate that one is divided about the possibilities of carrying out this transfer, said Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs Patricia Espinosa.
According to the immigration authority, the plane, which had arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of the transfer of M. Zelaya, had been placed by the Mexican government, had returned to its place of departure.
The coup d'état government wanted M. Zelaya to "abdicate" and to ask for political asylum abroad.
However, the agitated president refused to do so because he wished to return to Mexico as the most welcoming, acting head of state.
The coup 'regime' has suffered a renewed failure by trying to get me to give up at my expense (...), they wanted me to say thank you, 'said M. Zelaya to Radio Globo on Thursday, in which he has spoken frequently since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted for five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here well and like ten years, here I have my guitar, added the shortened President, who had fled two and a half months ago to the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa, beating some chords.
The Mexican Embassy has presented us with a request for permission, but unfortunately we cannot accept this request because it does not include a request for asylum. On Wednesday Oscar Raul Matute, Interior Minister of the coup d'état government, had told the Honduras Radio HRN.
I do not ask for asylum in any country at all, Manuel Zelaya had answered in an interview with the channel Telesur, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras, he had underlined, would only be undertaken as President of the people of Honduras.
The rumors of M. Zelaya ’ s departure on Wednesday had mobilized the supporters of the overthrown president who had set out to the Brazilian embassy and gathered around it, and the military there had intensified its deployment.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticised the position of the coup.
This, he said, reveals the marginal nature of this government in the light of international standards.
Zelaya, who had approached socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on 28 June, on the day of the referendum he organized to prepare for his re-election, contrary to the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
He had returned surprisingly from his exile in Costa Rica on 21 September and had fled to the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he is arrested for treason, which he is accused of by the judiciary, the coup d ’ état government said.
The coup leader Roberto Micheletti succeeded in organising a presidential election on 29 November to replace M. Zelaya.
Although Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States during the controversial election, it was rejected by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argenina or Brazil.
Three days later, the Congress had massively voted against M. Zelaya ’ s return to office until the expiry of his mandate on 27 January.
Wall Street upswing, US trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed with a high on Thursday, the figures of the American trade balance testify to a price recovery of the shares of the United States and their partners: the Dow Jones increased by 0.67%, the Nasdaq by 0.33%.
According to the stock exchange closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, while the Nasdaq, which is dominated by technology, has risen from 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The extended Standard & Poor's 500 index was posted at 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
There are good news from various sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
However, this remains anecdotal under the premise that the market only focuses on "half-full glasses", she said moderately.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are mainly focused on the figures of the American trade balance, "which shows an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The United States trade deficit fell by 7.6% to $32.9 billion in October, compared with September.
By contrast, analysts expected deficit growth.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the increase in the overall volume of trade, especially in the export of goods, which reflects the economic growth of the main trading partners of the United States, said Christopher Cornell of the Corporate Research Economy.com.
In return, unemployment reports in the United States have increased over the past week, despite all expectations, and have now reached the level of 474,000 inquiries.
However, during the last four weeks, the average value of new jobseekers has "fallen to the lowest point of the year", stressed Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The profitability of government bonds over 10 years has risen to 3.482% compared to 3.432% of Tuesday night, the profitability of bonds over 30 years to 4.492% compared to 4.408% of the previous night.
Cuba: Hundreds of guerrillas in power whistle out "Ladies in White"
On Thursday, hundreds of guerrillas in Cuban power whistled out the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the purpose of World Human Rights Day, and also thwarted another rally, for which a good dozen dissidents were temporarily arrested.
To the forty "ladies in white", wives or close political prisoners, were launched on open street by partisans of the government under Raul Castro, especially when they were on the foot march to the center of the capital, in order to demand the liberation of the political prisoners, a journalist of the AFP confirmed.
Down with the Yankies!, "mercenaries!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Fidel and Raul live!" chanted the empowered guerrillas with a raised fist against the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civil agents who had appeared to "ensure their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "Ladies in White" took place in Havana on the evening before, during which there were neither casualties nor arrests.
In the havanner district of Vedado, however, a dozen dissidents who also opened for Thursday ’ s demonstration in the face of the International Human Rights Day were temporarily arrested by civil police, a reporter from AFP confirmed.
According to this journalist, the police have forced the dissidents expelled by the guerrillas of the government to enter civilian vehicles under violence.
The temporary detention of dissidents in such circumstances is usually limited to a few hours.
As candidates for the Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the "Ladies in White" have organized an unapproved march for the purpose of the "request for the release of all political prisoners", the number of which, according to the Dissidentenliste, has about 200 persons, Laura Pollan, one of the leading women whose husband Hector Maceda is imprisoned for 20 years.
M. Maceda belongs to the group of 75 Cuban dissidents detained in March 2003, 53 of whom have been behind bars to date.
The Cuban authorities see the opponents of the regime as "mercenaries" or "agents" in the service of the declared arch-enemy, the United States.
One rarity in itself is that Cuban television reported on Thursday ’ s demonstration events between militant pro-government fighters and “counter-revolutionaries. ”
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of denigrating rights and freedoms, in particular freedom of expression.
Madness kills eighty year old with a knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy
A man armed with two knives killed an eighty-year-old and injured five more people on Friday, late afternoon, during the main business hours in downtown Clichy.
According to the survey, the 28-year-old assailant had injured the 80-year-old from previously unknown cause in or in front of a pharmacy on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures with two knives and, accordingly, with the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, is, according to an officer of the Police Syndicate Alliance in the hospital, subjected to the consequences of his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy he has a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in the Thirties, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims were hospitalized with serious injuries, where the eighty-year-old died.
The other injured person is in danger of life because, according to police sources, vital organs appear to have been affected.
The pregnant woman has become ill as a result of the events and, according to a police source, she is said to have been hospitalized in a "shock state".
The armed man, who seemed to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs after the war, should have immediately escaped the street, the same Boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have hurt two more passers-by, apparently by chance: a thirty and a forty year old, the latter of both of them heavy.
The scenario remained in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two meat knives which he had crossed behind his back, said Arnaud Pressé, a person in charge of the Syndicate Alliance of the Hauts region.
Several passers-by, including young people, are said to have tried to tame the madman according to the witness reports reported by AFP.
I saw a guy in the thirties with a green vest.
Three young people tried to intervene.
They didn't make it because the guy was well built, Alberto reported, a waiter of a nearby bar.
A horde fell over him, he added, including a city policeman who broke his wrist.
Two city police officers, among them her superior, still tried to arrest the armed man on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at number 61, and were injured with knife stitches, according to police figures.
The event took place in one of the main arteries of Clichy and Garenne, where a number of shops are located.
Passers-by have come to tell me that there is an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70 year-old person lying on the ground, I put her in First Aid and noticed a gaping wound in the stomach area, Frédéric Allione, a 35 year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person, about thirty years old, came injured by cuts.
Police officers from the State Police have finally arrested the man who did not carry ID documents.
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor ’ s Office has instructed the District Department of the Criminal Police of Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92) with the case investigation.
The madness has been hospitalized on Thursday evening.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been heard in court.
A police source does not exclude that it is delivered to a mental hospital.
According to another police source, six policemen needed to tame him at the police station in Clichy, where he had been taken away.
He was "in a state of exaggeration" like "all the mentally confused of this kind, in which the forces release themselves during the passage of day".
USA: Polanski ’ s lawyer calls for an end to law enforcement
On Thursday in Los Angeles (California, Western United States), the lawyer of the French and Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski once again called for the prosecution of his client, who is currently in court at his place of residence in Switzerland due to a moral offence of more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, lawyer of the director of the "pianist", denounced in front of three judges of the appeal court in the second district of California gross procedural errors at the time of negotiations in 1977.
I call for a criminal order, explained M. Hummel, before adding that the behaviour of the judge Laurence Rittenband, who was charged with the case at the time of the trial, "let it run down one's back cold".
According to him, the - meanwhile deceased - judge Rittenband, before he felled his verdict, had discussed with a prosecutor who is supposed to have told him that Roman Polanski deserved penitentiary -- which constitutes a serious procedural error.
This discussion had been raised in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and coveted), especially by the public prosecutor David Wells in question.
M. Wells had finally declared at the end of September that he had "lied" to the authors of the documentary.
Should the Court refuse to suspend criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel demands that a trial be conducted which would enable him to present the evidence of his reasoning.
For its part, the indictment has repeated the evidence already presented at first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the annulment of the facts charged to the accused cannot be seriously considered as long as Roman Polanski does not appear in court.
The 76 year-old director had fled the USA in 1978, even before the announcement of the sentence for "illegal sexual relations" with a minor of 13 years.
He has not travelled to the USA since that time.
The deputy prosecutor of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, had stated that Roman Polanski "must be there to attend the trial."
Would you like to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants who are able to escape?, asks Mrs. Asayma.
In her opinion, "the filmmaker asks the court for a favor and thereby despises his authority."
One of the three judges - who now have 90 days to announce their decision - even pointed out that "there are other alternatives to escape".
Hummel was not the only one who had requested the suspension of prosecution against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also once again demanded the lifting of the criminal proceedings.
She recalled that her client would no longer tolerate being harassed by any resurgence of the Affaire Polanski, adding, "No one in this room can say that this procedure was just.
Thirty-two years are enough. "
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland at the instigation of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was sentenced to house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad in anticipation of any extradition.
Wall Street is slowed down by the rise of the dollar and ends without a course.
The New York Stock Exchange closed at no price on Friday, in a market torn between better indicators than those planned in the US and an increase in the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63%, while the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
Based on the final figures at closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq scored 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The extended Standard & Poor's 500 index rose by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
"To be honest, the market is fairly quiet," said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
"It remains narrow, the volume of trade has become very small and I think this will remain so until the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than envisaged by Charles Schwab ’ s analysts, who “helped to improve the market view on the solidity of the recovery of the economy. ”
In the US, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, two months in a row and much more than planned.
Furthermore, the confidence of American consumers improved significantly in December, to 73.4 compared to 67.4 in the previous month, according to the index preview of the University of Michigan.
However, the indexes have been slowed down by a new increase in the dollar rate, which has reached the highest level compared to the euro for two months, putting down "the sectors that are vulnerable to the economic situation," explained Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have lost some ground.
The obligation market has declined.
The yield of the Treasury bond over 10 years increased by 3.540% on Wednesday evening compared to 3.482% and that of the bond over 30 years to 4.497% compared to 4.492% of the previous day.
Election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month ’ s round trip through South Africa, the 112 candidates will cross the last hurdle to realize their dream of being elected the most beautiful woman in the world and watching a billion TV viewers.
During this great beauty fair, which will be held for the second time in a row in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already reached the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were named Miss Sportive or Miss Topmodel during their African stay.
This was a real whirlpool of pleasures.
To visit beautiful cities, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Horn, was simply exceptional.
I have seen many things and made a lot of experiences!, said Miss Sierra Leone with full enthusiasm.
This competition will take place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be broadcast live on Saturday, from 5 p.m. (3 p.m. Central European Time) from Midrand, north of Johannesburg.
I could not imagine a more beautiful country to hand over my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have had this experience twice, Miss World underlined Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian woman, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the rediscovery of "breathtaking landscapes".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, meetings with the press and safari, the Miss now focus on the competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will also be present at this election, as well as to emulate Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and both were Bollywood stars.
It is of course the dream of every woman to be crowned once as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it is not just about the look.
We are ambassadors of our country and I would like to come home with the crown, Miss India throws a broad smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition is underlined with music and dance.
The candidates are deficient in traditional costumes and not to forget in swimsuit.
The performance will be presented by a TV presenter, the Chinese woman Angela Chow, Michelle McLean, the former beauty queen of South Africa, and Steve Douglas, who is responsible for the Miss World Committee.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to welcome the world with a cordiality and pride that can hardly be surpassed, assures Julia Morley, Chairman of Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, made a safari, visited the famous township in Soweto, but this time tasted by bicycle and local cuisine.
But the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them the hand, was quite extraordinary.
Not usual for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Their most beautiful memory, however, undoubtedly remains the draw in Cape Town (southwest) for the Football World Cup in June 2010, a kind of country to promote this event a little more.
I am wrong with people I would probably never be able to approach.
I will certainly return to the 2010 World Cup, promised Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive" according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive", his son David assured on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles Airport, where he visited his father who has been in the hospital for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is running very well, David Hallyday explained to the press when he left the plane, in which he arrived shortly after 13 o'clock local time (21 o'clock CET) from Paris.
The singer ’ s son, who made a relaxed impression, assured that he would "quickly" go to the hospital of Cedars and Sinaï, where Johnny Hallyday was delivered to Paris on 26 November due to a bacterial follow-up infection after an operation on a herniated disc incident.
The singer was "put into an artificial coma this night in Los Angeles to relieve his severe pain and perform his treatment, the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma by the doctors of the hospital Cedars and Sinaï in Los Angeles, where he was delivered to Paris on Monday because of a bacterial follow-up infection after an intervertebral disc operation on 26 November.
The singer had to undergo surgery again during the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to the pathological changes caused by the last operation.
His wife Laeticia took part in a school event in the French grammar school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, where her daughter Jade goes to school, a photographer from AFP noted.
The head of the department of orthopedic and traumatological surgery at the Pitié Hôpital, Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer on Monday at the hospital in Los Angeles.
The producer has severely burdened the neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated the singer on 26 November at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told that he had done the purest massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said that they were completely indignant, said Mr Camus.
I have heard that a court case may be opened, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "traveled far too fast and this with the permission of the Paris surgeon to Los Angeles".
I personally telephoned this doctor who assured me that he considered this trip to be completely unproblematic, which surprised me very much, since I myself already have two intervertebral disc operations behind me, he added.
Shortly before he announced on RTL that the singer apparently left the hospital after the operation "without drainage, without everything".
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in the artist environment.
He had operated on the actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly, where he was practising at that time.
In 2007 he had also operated on the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resorb a hematoma after a cerebral hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a dubious reputation, who has already been convicted several times for failed operations and not to mention tax evasion and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the medical chamber, called him "a man without scruples", who is "regularly" accountable to the board and is "anything but recommendable".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
The latter explained that the intervention would have been "perfect" and the post-operative investigations would have been "normal".
The operation "did not produce bleeding and therefore does not require drainage," he added.
In any case, the singer ’ s tour, whose health problems have been going on since last summer, seems to be in question.
It is quite clear that it is a little too short for a continuation of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens), Mr. Camus explained.
The party alliance UDF (Union for French Democracy) is becoming vigorous and calls on the Nouveau Centre Party not to use its seal anymore
The party alliance, supervised by François Bayrou's MoDem Party, reacted vigorously on Friday to a takeover attempt by the seal, the party once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, by the chairman of the Nouveau Centre Party, Hervé Morin, urging him, under threat of judicial prosecution, not to use this seal on any document.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF Seal because he believes that François Bayrou would not be worthy of defending this political legacy after having handed the hand to the left.
The Defence Minister, whose party partner is the UMP, wanted to reaffirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
He had received the support of Hervé de Charette (former UMP, now NC), who claims the ownership of the UDF brand, since he was the first to apply for this brand at the "Institut national de la propriété industrielle" in 2004.
However, the office of the party alliance UDF supervised by François Bayrous's friends broke the silence and clearly indicated that they could not be expropriated and, under threat of judicial prosecution, set a deadline for the minister and the deputy to no longer use this seal and to transfer the trademark's property rights.
You have made numerous statements in recent days that you would propose to your political movement to take over the UDF Seal +, wrote the party alliance in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem Party and Senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist alliance.
You also believed that you had the right to have the name of this movement + Nouveau centre +, the slogan + of today's UDF +, printed on their political material and on the home page of your website.
As you know, you do not have the right to use this seal, declared the UDF Secretariat and requested the NC party to "immediately remove the mention of the name UDF from all material as well as from (its) website".
In addition, Hervé de Charette was required "to transfer the trademark's property rights to its legal entities".
If you refuse to do so, we will bring an action against you in order to uphold the law and defend the legitimate rights of the members of the UDF, the signatories warned.
In their letter, they emphasize that "UDF" has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978, reminding that Morin and his friends "made the choice" to leave it in 2007 to establish a competing movement, as others had already done in 2002 to establish the party "UMP".
The Nouveau centre Party, according to the signatories, therefore has no rights whatsoever to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie française).
They also recall that the last UDF Congress in 2007 approved the three-year membership of the Modem Party and the establishment of a branch to defend "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As far as Hervé de Charette is concerned, the office continues, "at the time when he applied for the brand name, he was no longer a member of the UDF for three years, but of the UMP.
It benefits in a scandalous and fraudulent way from the lack of deposit of the acronym UDF to carry this out for itself.
Furthermore, you point out that this ruthlessness is in the best way of transforming itself into a crime, and ironic the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us in politics as well as in life more worthy to make itself a name, instead of trying to get out of anonymity by appropriating a name in a fraudulent way, in which one has no legal entitlements".
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt: François Marie Banier Sentenced for Weakness Exploitation
On Friday, the Court of Nanterre decided to judge the artist François Marie Banier in order to determine whether, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he has taken advantage of a weak moment of the eighty year old to smear part of their assets.
The 62 year-old photographer, who is known for his star photographs, will have to answer on 15 and 16 April 2010 for the exploitation of weakness in court, a crime punished with a maximum imprisonment of three years and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will indeed be a trial in this affair, worthy of the saga of one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter growl and at the same time have the reins of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal in their hands.
Likewise, however, the 15th Criminal Chamber ordered a medical examination of 87 year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is carried out jointly by three doctors.
The heir and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially under the conditions laid down during the investigation by the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office.
The doctors appointed on Friday are expected to submit a report before 10 March 2010 in which you will clearly state whether and at what times Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think it will undergo these investigations.
I will speak to her, said the lawyer of Ms Bettencourt, Me Georges Kiejman, after the hearing.
Regarding the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt, Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the court ’ s decision.
This is an excellent news (...). The report will prove that he (Banier) has manipulated this old lady you have to protect, he affirmed.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has brought a criminal lawsuit against François Marie Banier, a photographer and all-round artist, accusing him of having used her mother ’ s weakness for years in order to give herself a total of one billion euros in the form of bank checks, insurance policies or paintings.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt had always refuted being manipulated by the photographer, whom she regards as a long-time friend.
Although the court would have to examine the admissibility of the action initiated by Ms Bettencourt and Ms Meyers, the plaidoyers of the lawyers led to a major family debate on Friday.
Liliane Bettencourt ’ s lawyer has referred to three letters sent by his client to her notary (1999, 2003, and 2005) in which she wrote that she distrust the husband of Françoise Bettencourt.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: "Please tell my daughter that I wrote to Banier for fifteen years, once or twice a day.
I have never been able to speak to Françoise since her marriage ".
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor ’ s Office is again of the opinion that the plaintiff had no right to respond in this way, especially because a guardian has refused to file a request for judicial protection against her mother in the last few days.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legal, is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act in their place, ” said the prosecutor ’ s representative, Mrs Christine Daubigney.
The Court has now decided to give a ruling after the trial of Mme Bettencourt's admissibility has taken place.
Manager of the Revolution or the end of the Strategic Early Enlightenment?
If nothing changes in the leadership of major French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been free...
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to its employees, said the position of the companies vis-à-vis the consumer before the marketing revolution: It is for the personnel to join "values" determined to impose the best, as it used to be on the Consumer Products designed by the technicians in the factory.
By placing the customer in the center of the company, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in place... although the authoritarian temptation products separate factors to impose customer preferences again regularly!
Demobilisation of employees can lead to fatal demoralisation.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of a much larger phenomenon, affecting employees in particular.
This demobilisation has a negative impact on the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, in particular those of R & D and, more importantly, those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (Intelligence Economique = economic intelligence) "demands a proactive approach and a forward-looking view from all parties involved"; it claims from the employees a commitment that completely contradicts the instructions of authoritarian management.
That is why we are calling for an operational revolution that would consist of placing employees at the heart of the company ’ s concerns on an equal footing with customers.
The Very Conditional Benefits of Internal Opinion Surveys
Will the internal opinion polls, like the questionnaire Orange has submitted to his wage earners, stimulate this revolution in terms of management practice?
I am afraid, unfortunately not.
- First of all, because I was able to find out that in the face of a new situation, after many detours, the whole structure finally has to do what it has always done.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - increases proportionally to the meaning of its own failures.
And finally, because most leaders have a much simplified idea of human behavior.
Emanating from the major engineering schools, their interpretation of psychology is mechanistic.
They use intellectual comfort to adopt the old behavioristic theory, which has recently been reactivated by the US "Neurosciences" and unwittingly spread widely by research institutes and the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to use the "levers" (sic) to engage employees, an up-to-date Le Figaro.fr poll published by Ipsos encourages leaders to adopt a mechanistic governance system that is unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilisation factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern enterprises presupposes the acceptance of a definitive view of human behavior.
It consists of integrating a fundamental protocol into any consideration or practice of governance: for wage earners, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears to be a means of realizing part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
At the moment only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take over this conception of motivation of the employees.
These studies have shown that they assess their business on the basis of a given doxa that allows them to assess what it offers them to achieve their life goals through their perceived image of the company.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilisation factors, the managers of the companies can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and place their human resource management back in the right place.
In this way, they create a fertile soil favourable to the coordinated development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo Speech: "just war" brings Obama praise from the right
The American Right welcomed the speech given by Barack Obama in Oslo on Friday evening and was satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The conservatives who mocked the award to Obama on October 9 applauded this time the President ’ s speech, following the example of the former vice-president ’ s candidate for the 2008 elections, Sarah Trudeau.
I liked what he said, and he explained the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the US Today newspaper, adding that she herself raised the subject of a "sometimes necessary" war in her recently published memoirs.
The war is, of course, the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, tried on Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force; one way to declare his decision of nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt, expressed the opinion that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, the former President of the House of Representatives rejoiced, who particularly acknowledged the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in Obama's words.
In some parts, Ginrich, who was interviewed in the radio show "The Takeaway", completely felt that this speech was historical.
The previous deputy, who is considered by some to be a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was pleased to have seen a "left-wing president" who reminded the members of the Nobel Committee that they "were not free and could not hand over a price for peace if the use of force did not exist."
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor of the Washington Post, Obama has given "a very American speech."
In addition, he portrayed himself as a "cosmopolitan", as "he always does", he "spoke like an American president" when he pointed out that Europeans "live like a security bubble they did not create themselves and they do not do much to protect them", said Gerson.
Among the few unconvinced rights, former UN ambassador John Bolton, a hawk of the Bush era, described the speech on the website of the National Review Online as "boring, trampling and uninspiring."
On the left-wing side of the president, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama defends recourse to the armed forces.
If you pack the war under the guise of the judiciary, you can simply justify the massacre of the innocent, he warns.
The press of the moderate left, however, continues to praise the President.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes that the Nobel Prize has been awarded to Obama prematurely, described the speech itself as a "monumental work" for a speaker like him, known for his talent.
The speech in Oslo "offers a timetable for managing international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression", the Californian daily newspaper says enthusiastically.
The New York Times believes that Obama "announced the necessary discourse" and calls his speech "dark and exemplary at the same time".
Binoculars: Three marathons for an agreement that secures the supply to Christmas
After a three-week negotiation marathon, the trade unions of the Road Association and the TLF - the only employers' organisation that remained until the end - reached an agreement on Friday evening to put an end to the strike order and the threat of a severe supply shortage at Christmas.
At the signature meeting on Friday evening, State Secretary Dominique Bussereau, responsible for transport, "welcomed" the agreement, which was initiated on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiation, the negotiators separated early Friday morning in the hope that the agreement would be signed quickly late in the morning.
And that although the three employers ’ associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, more than six hours passed from the start of the meeting at 11: 00 a.m. until the agreement was reached and the agreement was signed only at 18: 00 p.m.
The conflict "would have caused a great deal of damage to companies" and "it was to be feared that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year", says Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a 4% increase in wages for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages thus rises from EUR 8.72 to EUR 9.06.
"This is not very much, but we start small," says Patrice Clos (FO).
The activists are now ordered not to block the supply centres.
"However, there will probably always be some unruly people who are not satisfied with the agreement," he adds.
TLF Chair Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement", although it was "difficult to grant these wage increases in the face of international competition".
According to him, the increase is 170 euros per month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on common sense and respect for employees," said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historic agreement."
Richard Jaubert (CGT) commented on 'an acceptable compromise'.
The agreement also provides for a 3% increase in travel costs and for the maintenance of the overall budget for road transport in the first half of 2010, which will in particular enable us to tackle the issue of 13th month salary and the modernisation of collective agreements.
M. Bussereau recalled that "the decrease in taxes on employers amounting to EUR 100 million" was the subject of an amendment by the government to the bill of corrected finances for 2009, which was passed on the night of Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government calls for an "identical" vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to apply first to the companies affiliated with this organisation and then to the entire profession in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
This will be the case "in the shortest time", insured Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' associations can only delay the procedure.
The association FNTR denounced a "fraudulent trade", because the EUR 100 million "had already been promised to the sector to compensate part of the carbon tax".
The State Secretary for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but rather in order not to consume the goose eaters on the coming Christmas days, the Unostra complains.
For the association Otre the agreement "threatens to shovel the small and medium-sized enterprises of the industry in the next 12 months a large grave".
Line RER A: disruptions this weekend, unions dissatisfied with the proposals of RATP
The disturbances on the RER A line, France ’ s largest high-speed rail network for the Paris metropolitan area and the Ile-de-France, continued on the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the 2nd strike day between the trade unions and the management of the RATP (Independent Parisian Passenger Transport Authority) continued to wait for strikers with their demands for wage subsidies.
There were no trains on this important shopping weekend before Christmas between 10: 00 and 20: 00. On the central route (between La Défense and Nation), only one of two trains was ready for use and only one of four trains was outside the central route.
The connection to SNCF trains was interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture, which forced passengers to change trains.
The Galeries Lafayette department store chain, which has 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP is trying to tie up the big business in terms of traffic."
The RER A line crosses the Paris metropolitan area from west to east.
The section of the RATP connects the places Saint Germain and Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy and Saint Léger and Marne.
On Friday, about one of two trains operated on schedule at the main traffic time, and almost none during the low traffic time.
As already on Thursday, there was no alarm on the platforms, as the inhabitants of the Île-de-France had adjusted to the situation.
So early in the morning, the station of Saint Germain and Laye (Yvelines) was far less crowded than usual, especially because of the lack of high school students.
Jack Nbakina, engineer (29), said that he would have "got up one and a half hours earlier in order to get to work on time" in Boissy.
The SNCF, which had planned to take care of the travellers by staff and police, pointed out that there had been no bottlenecks in Saint Lazare station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on the RER A line, or in the direction of Cergy, arrived or departed via Saint Lazare station in order to ensure the connection to the metros.
On Saturday and Sunday the general meetings of the strikers were held again, during which the results were reviewed, which the associations had classified after the meeting with the leadership on Friday afternoon as "poor".
The RER Managing Director proposed the specific elaboration of a protocol for the RER A line with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, career paths, etc.
But this is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud), they demand a long payroll surcharge.
The CGT was outraged by the fact that the RATP itself put its wage surcharge proposals in brackets and stressed that the leadership "is not able to solve a problem, whereas this was possible with the long-distance drivers and the SNCF."
The RATP made it clear that a new meeting on "comprehensive examination of working conditions" was planned for Monday.
This also shows the associations that the company "ignores the weekend drivers".
In the morning about 150 riders visited the branch of a committee in Paris.
Once again, it was the leaders who, up to now, rejected any discussion during the strike and suggested a meeting after a calming of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to expand to the RER B line following a pre-announcement by Unsa and Indépendants.
The associations demand a wage surcharge of 120 (Unsa) to 150 Euros, of which 30 Euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants). Furthermore, they deplore the deterioration of working conditions on this route, on which millions of travellers travel every day.
The drivers of the RER line, who have years of professional experience, receive a gross wage of 2,200 to 2,700 euros and a wage surcharge of 600 to 650 euros for shift services as well as Sundays and public holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves per Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
On Friday, the Turkish Constitutional Court announced the dissolution of the country ’ s main pro-Kurdish party; a decision that immediately followed furious demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to make the work of the government enormously difficult, which endeavours to reach out to the Kurdish community in order to put an end to the conflicts that have been going on for 25 years.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "site for activities which are detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity", said the President of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kiliç four days after the decision to the press.
According to Kiliç, the decision would have been taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes required to impose the dissolution. He also pointed out that 37 of the party ’ s leaders, including Chairman Ahmet Türk and parliamentarian Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from political events for five years.
Furthermore, the judge announced the abolition of parliamentary immunity, which Turkish and Tugluk enjoy, as well as the confiscation of the party ’ s goods.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (of 550).
The party leaders expressed themselves before the verdict that parliamentarians would rather leave Parliament than meet like parliamentarians.
The decision was followed by a trial initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Turkish federal court Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya. He accused the DTP of following the "instructions" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is regarded by Ankara and many other countries as a terrorist organization.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has "no connection" with the PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate.
The verdict of the Constitutional Court is in between the government, which endeavours to accommodate the Kurdish community and to propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds, in order to let the Kurds lose their support for the PKK and to put an end to the conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP reaffirm that a resolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in the southeast of Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the prison conditions of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have led to clashes with the police in recent weeks.
Since the court announced, thousands of demonstrators gathered in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, a city of millions in the southeast, which is predominantly populated by Kurds.
The police used tear gas grenades and water cannons when the demonstrators started throwing Molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Türk assumed that the court's decision "will further deepen despair".
"Turkey cannot clarify this (Kurdish, editorial note) question on the basis of the prohibition of a party," he explained to the press.
The government, consisting of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
"We are in principle opposing the closure of the parties.
This does not solve the problems, "said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedo of democratic openness promoted by the government," said political market observer Ahmet Island.
"You can obviously get caught up in a reaction from the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK committed an attack that killed seven soldiers in northern Turkey three days earlier, one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
The snowfall can come
A really crisp winter, that is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass the citizens, says the FES winter service manager.
But so that its employees can test and master the entire vehicle technology.
According to meteorologists, this could be the first time this weekend.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES proceeds according to a precise plan.
As soon as it snows everywhere in Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A routes with large spreader vehicles are deported, explains Brauburger.
These include major traffic and thoroughfares such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also fire service, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and routes with slopes, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The service of FES starts at three o'clock in the morning
The approximately 1040 kilometres would have to be scattered in maximum three hours with moisture salt, which is better adhered to.
That is why the FES starts at three o'clock at night, "so that the routes are free until the professional traffic starts".
It would be difficult if it snowed at 7.30 a.m.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because then no one is willing to make the spreader space".
Only after that, if it does not continue to snow, are the feeder and catch-up roads, which also includes the Council of Beil and Road, turn.
The last priority is side and side roads.
There will be complaints, Brauburger knows.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES pedestrian sets off, priority is given to hazard points and transitions.
The FES usually cannot take care of all cycle paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which keeps the bridges in mind from 22 to 4.30, says Brauburger.
As there is smoothness on this, as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees, the spreader is on the way.
If necessary, the police will call him.
The cradle of dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: the two meter long and 1.50 meter tall animal ran on two strong hind legs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would be nothing special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body features, according to Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the journal Science of Thursday.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today's New Mexico, which at that time was in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangäa at the equator.
Tawa opens a new window on the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us a lot about the relationship, the propagation and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavation on the Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We have sometimes found a dozen dinosaurs in one day, which is unprecedented for deposits from the Triassic, reports team member Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as new species.
During the excavation, they gathered the remains of a total of five individuals.
Fund confirms theories about Dino's early history
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi and Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an extraordinary discovery: "Dinosaurs are extremely rare, mostly only single fragments."
Other dinosaurs do not necessarily share the enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to the current doctrine, dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils, however, are incomplete, which is why the assignment of these urine dinos is usually controversial.
For example, the experts are debating when the lizards split into their three main lines of development: the carnivorous theropods, which later included the Tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the four-legged sauropods and their relatives known as "long-legged necks", and the Ornithischia (bird-crested aurians), which included, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
After the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropod.
It has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found evidence of air bags, as they also possess the descendants of the theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air bags, the breathing of the birds is more efficient than that of the mammals.
At Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were apparently partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of the giant Sauropods later also possessed airbags and lightweight bones, probably already the common ancestor of both groups had produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known so far lived in South America, the researchers conclude that the lizards appeared there for the first time.
Thus, the three development lines separated early and spread from South America over all parts of the world, which at that time still formed a single land mass as a supercontinent Pangäa.
The fact that the team together with Tawa hallae found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropods speaks for this.
The three cannot come from a common immigrant ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe that there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
Of course, there are contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says the Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could give a distorted picture, because in South America there have simply been a lot of primitive dinosaurs, while on other continents hardly anything can be found.
As the dinosaurs managed to develop from a relatively rare lateral line of the reptile stem to the dominant farmers of the Middle Ages, it is still mysterious.
During the Triassic the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and the flying aurians and with numerous other lizards.
Towards the end of the Triassic the dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while the relationship died out on the border from the Triassic to the Jura.
Success story did not last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There might have been a mass death that the dinosaurs happened to survive, but not the other reptiles.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so that they could beat the competition out of the field.
The success story did not last forever.
150 million years later a meteorite impact helped a group of animals to bloom, which had also developed in the Triassic and since then has been a shadow existence: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors of the University of Toronto stand on it, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or from Berkeley in California.
Lecturers from Naples are from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police clearance of the occupied casino of Frankfurt ’ s Goethe University hits waves worldwide.
278 professors and lecturers from the Goethe University, but also from universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, are in solidarity with the protesting students on Campus Westend.
In a statement written in German and English, they "disapprove" of the police operation initiated by the Bureau.
President Werner Müller of Estonia had the building occupied by students and teachers in the education strike vacated last week because walls and works of art had been lubricated.
Five students were injured.
The material damage, the signatories judge, did not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized courses of students and teachers by a police command".
The eviction represents an "unacceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves "the delegation and criminalization of protest" and distracts from the contents.
The Bureau has withdrawn from the necessary discourse.
The lecturers call for the immediate suspension of criminal prosecution.
The majority of squatters did not support damage to property, it says.
Protest legitimized
The youth of the trade union Verdi and the German Trade Union Confederation also show solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of a growing concern for one's own future, says Verdi's State Youth Secretary Alexander Klein.
However, Hesse ’ s science minister Eva Kühne Trudeau Hörmann (CDU) defended the action of the university president and the police.
We are grateful to the President of the Union.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday in the Wiesbaden state parliament.
We understand the protest, but we do not understand the vandalism, according to the CDU state parliament deputy Peter Beuth.
The opposition groups SPD, Greens and Left saw this differently.
The CDU takes painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of dealing with the students ’ arguments and demands, they have been cleared.
The Left has tabled a motion calling on the Interior Minister to report on the police operation.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to western visitors.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of the capital Moscow, was a strictly guarded location for secret armaments research in the Soviet Union.
Today, the municipality with its 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important research and production sites for micro and nanoelectronics are here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd had already established contacts with Riedberg, a research location in Frankfurt, with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday now Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "Protocol for closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
The Moscow Deputy Mayor Yuri Roslyak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, for Frankfurt signed planning department Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized companies will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is about a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies are able to gain a foothold in the growing Russian market.
Conversely, Russian science companies want to get orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of important Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronic Engineering, the major Sitronics and Rossiyskaya Elektronika corporations.
The Commune was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planning city" for armaments research.
Selenograd (literally translated "Grünstadt") got its name from the wooded hilly landscape in which the research institutions are embedded.
Stuttgarter Bremsklotz
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
For the proponents of the project, it is simply about "the new heart of Europe".
S21 is much more than the laying down of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which will plunge the city of the bathing capital of Württemberg for a decade into healing construction site chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was born out of the spirit of the 1980s.
At that time, railway stations with tracks that end in the middle of the city were considered to be the traffic technology fossils of the 19th century, which looked like brake blocks of modern rail traffic, because once it took an enormous amount of time to rewind locomotives from the back to the front.
Drive in, keep short, continue - that's how it should go.
And therefore the tram stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a thoroughfare station, which lies approximately halfway between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava on the trans-European railways - hence the slogan of the "heart of Europe".
S21 is actually being addressed now, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realized that it is almost priceless in the Hessian and the Bavarian metropolis to implement lowering.
However, there are no longer any problems with entry and exit stations since there are modern turning trains with railcars and steering cars at both ends.
Nevertheless: Stuttgart 21 together with the new ICE line to Ulm is now approached.
National and local politicians have enforced it.
The railways are involved, also because the risks of the largest infrastructure carries individual projects of the Republic of the Taxpayers and not of the state corporations.
The project can still be reasonably justified in terms of urban planning.
New urban space is created, which - if one believes the computer-generated graphics of the planners - is equipped with a lot of green.
For the rail transport system, S21 is harmful.
The transit station and the extension of the route are intended for passenger transport, to which one attributes - typical 80s - huge growth.
At that time there was not yet the competition of low-cost pilots.
However, modern transport policy must first be about strengthening freight transport, as rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than road transport.
But the new line is not suitable for freight trains because of heavy gradients.
Even more serious is that S21 indirectly affects many other rail projects.
A good six billion euros are to be booked in Swabian.
That is the official number.
Experts consider ten to 15 billion realistic.
It is certain that in the next decade the money will be missing from other nodes and bottlenecks on the net.
A total of sixty larger projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of the 180 km long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987 the track has been built in slow motion.
It would be urgent to press the tube correctly.
But S21 will act as a brake block.
The Rhine valley line becomes a bottleneck for international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
Government examines judgment on the airport
The state government has left the Wiesbaden state parliament open whether it will go against the judgment of the Hessian administrative court (VGH) to the night flight ban in revision.
The CDU / FDP coalition had commissioned experts to have the more than 400 pages of the VGH verdict legally examined, said Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP).
On that day, the VGH in Kassel had written that the country had to re-regulate the night flight ban in the case of the construction of the planned Northwest runway at Frankfurt Airport.
The registration of 17 flights between 23 and 5 o'clock, as provided for by the state government, is not compatible with the legal protection of the population against nocturnal flight noise.
The coalition must decide by 4 January whether it will go against the verdict in revision.
The opposition criticised this delay and urged the representatives of the government to renounce a revision at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
Social Democratic Party leader Torsten Schafer called on the CDU and FDP to return to their promises made before the election to a night flight ban. Otherwise, this should be regarded as a "wording break".
It is damn hard, if you can keep his word, said Greens leader Tarek al-Wazir in allusion to the FDP's election slogan "We keep word".
Minister Posch rejected the accusation of Schäfer and Gümbel that the state government is trying to get to its night flights with "legal distortion and trickery".
An exact legal examination needs their time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "quick first impression".
We need a legally secure decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As it represented the opposition, his group's statements on the night flight ban had never been.
United States Banks pay back aid
The crisis-ridden US major banks strip off their state shackles.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America repaid a total of 45 billion dollars (about 30 billion euros) of aid from the Bank Rescue Fund Tarp at one stroke.
According to a report by the US broadcaster CNBC, Citigroup is also planning to reimburse state aid.
The institutions want to get rid of the restrictions associated with the acceptance of the money - such as the limitation on the payment of manager bonuses and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had concerned itself about convertible bonds about 19 billion dollars of fresh money with investors.
She took the rest of the sum from her own cash register, which was, among other things, well filled by division sales.
Bank head Kenneth Lewis expressly thanked the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening: The money injection had helped over a very difficult time.
The money house had risen to the height of the financial crisis with the acquisition of the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
The Citigroup also wants to raise money on the capital market to liberate itself from its liabilities to the state.
As early as Thursday, the US Bank could announce a $20 billion increase in its capital, CNBC reported citing circles.
A Citigroup spokesman did not want to speak.
In June Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already repaid their aid.
Quick choice
Then everything went faster than thought.
Hardly two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors pushed the current editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender out of office, the broadcaster can present a successor.
Yesterday evening, the body wanted to vote on staff.
The favorite was Peter Frey, director of ZDF ’ s capital studio in Berlin.
However, there was no confirmation from the transmitter - officially, so as not to prejudge the procedure.
However, it should also have played a role not to further damage ZDF ’ s intendant Markus Schächter if this proposal does not go through with the Board of Directors.
Frey, Schächter ’ s candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 committee members.
The result of the vote was not yet determined at the end of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter failed on the Board of Directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members advocated Brender, seven voted against him. Brender ’ s election was a harsh defeat for Schächter, but an expectable one.
After all, the majority of the Union in the Board of Directors had already signalled weeks before the election that Brender did not wish to confirm his position.
Organized the resistance against the chief editor of the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that under Brender ZDF ’ s news broadcasts had lost ratings, he refused another term of office for the highly respected editor-in-chief.
Until shortly before the election, there were therefore protests in which the political influence on ZDF was scourged.
Last but not least, 35 state lawyers had interfered in the debate, which considered Kochs to be unconstitutional.
Nothing has been used.
To the person
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romance studies.
He then worked at Südwestfunk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983 Frey moved to ZDF, first to the "today's journal".
Subsequent stations: from 1988 to 1990 personal speaker of the editor-in-chief; 1991 / 92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and moderator of the "Morgenmagazin"; until 2001 head of ZDF's foreign policy; since then head of ZDF's capital studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional lawsuit following Brender ’ s election, which was still elected journalist of the year by the Medium magazine on Wednesday.
Kochs Widerpart in the Board of Directors, the Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that the countries should change the ZDF State Treaty in such a way that the intendant ’ s personnel proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, Beck also ruled out an extract of party politicians from ZDF ’ s supervisory bodies.
Brender ’ s prospective successor Peter Frey had recommended himself to the Board of Directors with a wise move - by heavily criticizing the Board immediately after the Brender election.
Thanks to this example of journalistic independence, he was able to nominate both Schächter without loss of face for the post of Chief Editor and the Board of Directors without being suspected of holding a party member in office.
In party arithmetics, Frey is already attributed to the left-wing liberal.
Study is detoxified
Partial success for the students: After a year of the education strike, the cult ministers of the countries finally introduced on Thursday: At a meeting of cult ministers and university rectors conference both sides agreed to improve the study conditions with Bachelor and Master.
Students should be able to cope with their studies in the future.
In detail, they agreed to reduce the burden on examinations: In principle, each study module should only complete with a single examination.
In addition, the workload of the students is to be checked and "a realistic and justifiable measure" guaranteed.
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of examinations between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to making common structural requirements for bachelor and master programmes more flexible.
Furthermore, there should be no different country arrangements.
Less testing
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, cult ministers and university rectors have carried the winged word of better student ability in their mouths.
Now it was filled with concrete content for the first time.
The so-called accreditation council decided to reduce the number of examinations in part drastically: "Each module usually completes with only one examination", it says in a 30 pages paper, which is to regulate the admission of study courses in part.
With the "significant reduction of the audit burden", the accreditation council chairman Reinhold Grimm said, a "miscarriage development should be stopped, which considerably impaired the student life."
In addition, the "studyability" should be the decisive criterion in the future "in the design.
Modules such as content should be "strictly checked" whether "unnecessary constraints on students' choice of
Events "would be avoided.
Students would be entitled to "maintain room for manoeuvre that allows and promotes self-initiative".
The rules should apply when approving new courses, but also when reviewing existing ones.
These must be "reaccredited" every five years - which means, however, that it will take until 2015 for all courses to be reviewed.
Ten accreditation agencies are responsible for this throughout Germany and are subject to the accreditation council set up by the countries.
In October, the Ministers of Education had "urged" the countries to influence the agencies in such a way that the quantity of substances is not too large and the audit regime is not too strict.
In individual federal states universities and universities of applied sciences have already agreed with the state ministries on appropriate measures.
As the only country to date, Rhineland Palatinate pledged additional funds for the further development of the Bologna Process.
The main aim of the money is to set up tutoring programmes and to strengthen academic advice and exam and foreign offices.
Countries and universities want to spend ten million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government intends to introduce an amendment to the university law into parliament.
According to this, only one exam is needed to complete a study model.
The purpose of the study is to become more flexible, to ensure the recognition of certificates of achievement at other universities and to facilitate access to the master's degree.
By the end of next year, all courses of study in the country will be reviewed for their students.
Government and opposition had again argued on Thursday about the study conditions in the country.
Besides praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Board of the Juso Federal Higher Education Groups demanded that the design of education policy should no longer take place "behind closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the education strikes, the students as affected ones should "talk a word".
The future academics received support from the President of the HRK, Margret Wintermantel: "We need the students' experience," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education with whom the HRK discussed a joint reform paper.
In total, the Bonn decisions did not go far enough for the Education and Science Trade Union (GEW): they demand a legal entitlement that enables every graduate with a Bachelor degree to have access to a secondary master ’ s degree.
On the other hand, countries must ensure that sufficient master ’ s courses with the best possible study conditions will be available tomorrow for today ’ s generation of bachelor ’ s students, according to GEW ’ s board member Andreas Keller.
Countries must employ significantly more lecturers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not express themselves to a freer access to the Master.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Entry into Germany and from it is nicely almost no control "... is the beginning line of a poem of the poet Werner Söllner, in which this in disturbing linguistic scapes thematizes the arrival experience of a dissident, who gained the freedom but at the same time lost his linguistic space.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children ’ s book publishing house before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded several literary prizes, in 1993 he held the legendary Frankfurt poetry lectures at the Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hessian Literature Forum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He caused considerable non-literary sensation last Tuesday during a conference in Munich, which was about "German literature in Romania in the mirrors and mirrors of their security records".
Söllner published a statement in which he admitted his cooperation as IM for the Romanian secret service Securitate to Romanian colleagues of writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of those present, Söllner received the German Language Prize in 1989.
The recruitment attempts had begun creeping, first in 1971.
I am, concluded Söllner, "so someone who has not resisted the intimidation attempts of the Securitate enough."
The poet Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the Nobel Prize laureate for Herta Müller and her unprecedented literary engagement with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene, and especially the community of the German authors from Romania, is shaken by a case that identifies the abysses and the downfall of a political system based on surveillance and spying.
Werner Söllner is, as far as one can say according to previous knowledge, not only perpetrators, but also victims.
In his Securitate Act IM Walter played a role, according to the confession of Söllner, the literary scholar Michael Markel, referring to the positive influence of IM Walter.
He "cut him out" in all points that were difficult for him at that time, according to Markel.
It is a moral need for him to make this comment.
Söllner ’ s declaration was unexpected in form and in front of this audience, but the confession of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not completely surprising.
Herta Müller had already written in July after reading her own file, 914 pages.
Those affected, one may assume, are speculated and in some cases probably also knew which clear name was hidden behind the names Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
In contrast to the now very reliable sighting of the Stasi files in Germany, dealing with the legacies of the Securitate surveillance is still very diffuse.
A systematic education has been undermined and hindered in recent years.
A National Council for the revision of the Securitate Act (CNSAS) was established in 1999, but since then the publication of the files has been slow.
Only since 2005 there has been a law governing the management of the files.
After the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, an interview in which a former Securitate leader from Temesvar spoke abruptly about the prize winners showed that the influence of former Securitate ’ s members in Romania is still very great.
She has a psychosis, after all, she was only interrogated once.
The infamy of power meant to be able to express itself here wholeheartedly in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly, the Söllner case, as so often in connection with hidden guilt, is bound up with inevitable questions.
Why only now? Who was harmed? The thoughtful reaction of the listeners to Söllner ’ s confession gives hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by a desire for knowledge rather than by blame and shame.
For the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Saturation supplement Champions League
It seemed as if there was just an adreded-dressed sales clerk from a very nice Christmas party at which a sports goods manufacturer had distributed goodies, when the new VfB coach Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag of the outfitter, rose a quarter of an hour after midnight into a called C ’ class.
The man with the distinctive balt let himself be chauffeured because of the city still foreign to him.
Otherwise he could have driven himself - alcohol wasn't in the game after all, and the 55-year-old was just as little drunk with luck.
Had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work just continues.
Or just get started.
In the words of the Swiss only three days earlier committed: "We have reached the Eighth finals", namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3-1 victory against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let ourselves be dazzled by the success: it will be a brutal hard fight against the descent."
The "much more important task" is on Sunday.
Then it is necessary to repeat in Mainz the royal classes of performance in the league of everyday life.
And the weaknesses revealed again after the fast three goals by Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.).
Draw
The Eighth finals of the Champions League (Hinspiele 16 / 17 + 23 / 24 February / Rückspiele 9 / 10 + 16 / 17 March) will be drawn in Nyon on 18 December.
The joy about the brilliant debut of the Babbel successor remained thus behaving.
Not only with the supposed salvation bringer, who had conveyed confidence, commitment and joy to the insecure Stuttgart professionals in the short time.
I went to the players and told them that they should reflect on their strengths and stopped them to be more courageous, explained Seelenklempner Gross the so simple sounding success recipe, which under therapist Babbel had no effect any more.
He has kindled a certain magic, admitted Babbel ’ s advocate Jens Lehmann, “when a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn ’ t have thought possible. ”
And Sami Khedira, who became the best player on the pitch after weeks of injury due to his dynamics, tried to describe the detected "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the working method of the new superior: "He is a man who grasps through and demands discipline.
That is what we need in the current situation. "
Under Babbel it had obviously been lacking.
VfB Stuttgart is not yet over the mountain, warns sports director Horst Heldt
The VfB Stuttgart needs, however, above all Konstanz.
Like Gross, players and managers were wary of overestimating the victory against a weakened and completely overtaxed defense against the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before four days later the evil awakening came in Leverkusen at the 0: 4, Khedira said.
And Sports Director Horst Heldt warned that although one season goal was achieved, the other was still far away.
We are not yet above the mountain.
The fact that Heldt did not feel like celebrating after his 40th birthday even after the first home match for three months was due to the events of the weekend, which freshly revived in the form of a television interview by goaltender Jens Lehmann immediately before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, Heldt countered Lehmann ’ s harsh criticism.
He had accused the board of leadership of being weak and had decided to change coaches to pressure puberting fans.
Even that his free day had been cancelled after games, Lehmann regarded as a sign of lack of sovereignty and unhappiness.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness", Heldt returned and announced consequences for the netminder.
They will probably no longer be friends for life, the two forty-year-olds.
After all, however, they agreed with all the others that without the preparatory work by the detached coaching team the playful and combative strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a great deal of success," said Heldt and Lehmann unisono - and also the man with the plastic bag agreed.
World Cup Fight in Heavyweight
Warm duel in Bern: Kevin Johnson ’ s challenger always provoked World Champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds the Ukrainian defended his heavy weight title according to version of the WBC.
The judgement of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains box champion in heavy weight.
The 38 year-old champion according to version of the association WBC defeated the US American Kevin Johnson unanimously on Saturday in Bern by points (120: 108, 120: 108, 119: 109).
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Previously the Ukrainian was already twice world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately it did not work with the K.o., which everyone expected.
Klitschko built his balance sheet on 39 victories in 41 professional fights, twice he had to give himself beaten due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept the first defeat in the 24th fight.
In front of some 17,000 spectators in the Bernese Arena, the 2.02 metre high Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight mainly with his left-hand leadership.
The eleven centimetres smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko ’ s era before the duel, however repeatedly escaped the World Champion ’ s beating, so that Klitschko could not bring his dangerous rights to the goal decisively.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and only tried to get over the rounds.
He provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, but his blows rarely hit the world champion.
After all, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went with Klitschko over the full distance of twelve laps.
The challenger had caused some turmoil before the fight in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as "ugly zombie" who "can't do anything right".
When weighing, the champion was then provoked on Friday to push Johnson's sunglasses off his nose, "to see his eyes."
Fourth Victory after Detroit ’ s comeback
Klitschko also remained victorious in his fourth fight after his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After nearly four years of leaving, he had beaten Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and "brought back his" WBC Belt, which he had to leave without a fight before.
This year he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the USA in his defending title.
I only got one blow in this fight and am physically very good in shape, Klitschko had justified the quick return to the ring.
His dream, however, remains the union of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is World Champion of WBO and IBF Associations.
The belt of the WBA, however, is worn by the British David ∑, after he was able to dethrone the 2.13 metre tall Nikolai Waluyev in November.
He had previously cancelled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September this summer.
Allegedly, his doctoral company is already planning the fight against Klitschko in the London stadium.
Kunduz case
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Party leader Jürgen Trittin has called Defence Minister ∑ a liar for false information about the Kunduz affair.
SPD and left demand clarification from the Chancellor.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to recent findings on the Kunduz air raid, the opposition has deliberately deceived Defense Minister Karl Theodor zu Wulff (CSU).
The minister had said "knowingly the falsehood" to the deadly bombardment on two tank trucks of September, said Green Party leader Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD's news program "Tagesschau".
This is commonly called: He lied.
The order to kill was issued in defiance of the rules of the International Protection Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the substance of the report that NATO had read, which Mr QC read, said Trittin.
On Friday it became known that the attack was not only about destroying the abducted vices, but also about killing two Taliban leaders.
In the US air raid requested by the German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein, up to 142 people had been killed or injured according to NATO investigation report.
On Saturday, the Greens, the SPD and the Left called on Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Merkel really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel has to clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the Federal Government ’ s policy on Afghanistan – and whether Chancellor ’ s Office, Bundeswehr and intelligence service have approved this new strategy – demanded Jürgen Trittin and Green Party colleague Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm firmly rejected the criticism.
The Chancellery did not influence the concrete operations of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts about the presentation of the Ministry about the background to the dismissal of General Inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert had also become loud.
According to information provided by the SPIEGEL, the two dpa informed correctly and completely about the background of the tank truck attack.
Officially, they had denied the existence of NATO ’ s reports and denied the minister sensitive details.
However, the two top officials said that they had even referred to several reports from the Ministry of Defence, including a two-page document by commanding Colonel Klein and a military report.
Wichert is said to have asked in a letter for clarification of the facts, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung".
He has not received an answer so far, he says.
The ministry did not comment on the charges on Saturday and pointed out that this would be clarified in the investigative committee of the Bundestag, which intends to constitute itself next Wednesday.
Dreamworlds
Some see images in an alert state and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
The boundaries between imagination and reality are blurred not only in the mentally ill and in drug intoxication.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can freely indulge in the wildest imaginations and fantasies.
But those who experience dreamlike states, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are usually considered crazy or drug addicted in the modern Western world, at least as a Sonderling.
But such images and voices arise not only in the mentally ill or in drug intoxication.
Our imagination is to blame: the same neural processes that enable us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels sometimes make the boundaries between dream, delusion and reality blur.
Weakly changed states of waking consciousness can occur in different forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case delusion.
Although triggers and effects may differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic states of Rapture, psychosis and hallucinations can be traced back to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of the neuronal messenger substances of the brain - above all dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - is derailed and the interaction of different brain parts is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often during schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no more power over him
The connection between delusion and dream has occupied philosophers and physicians since antiquity.
Aristotle conceived hallucinations as a form of dream in the waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, stated in 1861 a "great similarity of error with dream states", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis, with all inconsistencies, delusions, deceptions of senses".
It is autumn 2001, when Henning T. turns into a cartoon character.
His body is two-dimensional and squeaky.
Gravity no longer has power over him, it hovers on the ceiling.
He feels a kick.
Behind it winged devil shapes with blood-red, distorted scratches, tooth-flexing.
They hunt him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain of the whole body.
Loud, evil voices roar from walls and radio.
He can no longer endure them, the voices that insult him and insult him.
Henning T. tears two cables out of the stereo system, knots them to a loop and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
He climbs a loudspeaker and lays the loop around his neck.
Jump.
The loop dissolves.
This is to be a lesson to you, the voices scream in drum-shredded choir, "Go to the clinic and let yourself be healed!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychosis, the last is 2 years ago, the first almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective-paranoid psychosis, moreover he is manically depressed, he takes medication against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis, I have experienced the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The illusions are cruel reality
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their lives, while in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, those affected can no longer distinguish between the inner and the outer world, they get into an exaggerated state that can lead to hallucinations, magnitude, relationship or persecution.
Particularly common is the hearing of votes - voices that command, comment or dialog.
Optical hallucinations are also not uncommon.
The affected person can no longer separate important things from the unimportant, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded by impressions.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the locks to a flood of ideas and fantasies that originate from deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centered, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, senior physician at the Department of General Psychiatry at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is in the center of the event, everything has a meaning directed towards it.
At the same time it gets into a passive role, it is overwhelmed by the events, similar to the dream, and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenics therefore often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In most cases, it is not possible for them to balance reality, the illusions are cruel reality, awakening excluded.
To have experienced a hallucination once in life
Unlike in a dream, Fuchs says, "the sensual and spatial structure of reality, which is perceived in psychosis, remains fundamentally preserved."
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of experience takes place within the real framework.
Why exactly our brain proposes caprioles, researchers still pose puzzles.
Exception states can lead to a short-term loss of reality in every person, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers assume that there are minimal brain damage in patients.
We suspect that the neural maturation of the brain is disturbed at an early stage of development, by a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy for example, explains Fuchs.
But there remains a mystery as to how the disturbance of the neuronal system comes about, which moreover does not manifest at all for many years at first.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can trigger a psychosis if there is a disposition.
hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychosis as they intervene in the transmitter system.
When our brain is running hot
The crazy thing is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get them, says Lübeck psychology professor Erich Kasten.
Whether illusions are perceived as pleasant or unpleasant is often only a matter of standpoint.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and deception for ten years, last year he evaluated his results in the book "The unreal world in our head".
Hallucinations belong to the typical side effects of psychosis, but also of amazingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, these often also include diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's disease and brain traumata.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, even the brain of healthy people hallucinates.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, are composed of memory contents that are normally held back.
They arise when brain areas in which sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or inhibited too little; when our brain is running hot or even when stimulation is missing.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also irritation, stress, love sorrow or other mental states of emergency.
In recent studies, up to a third of respondents stated that they had experienced hallucination at least once in their lives.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg's Western Pomerania and visits the grammar school there.
A normal girl, actually.
If there were not the pictures and voices.
During the break it may happen that a saggy boy with long, dark hair addresses it.
When it answers it, the classmates look at it surprised - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They consider this shy girl to be a spun daydreamer, but Sarah K. does not dream, she knows.
She is awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bench next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the boy.
Am I crazy?, she sometimes asks herself.
But she knows that this boy and the other fallacies are not real and disappear again.
At night the phenomena are usually frightening
Often the illusions are also a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she sometimes cannot follow the teaching material because the teacher presents a new fellow student in her eyes and ears, while he explains mathematical equations for all the others, both audible and visible on the table.
At night the phenomena are usually frightening.
When she waits for sleep in her dark room, which comes far too rarely and much too late, she often cannot distinguish whether she is awake or already dreams whether the pictures she sees, the scratches or the girl with the bleeding cuts on arms and legs, before her open or closed eyes arise.
Let me alone, she screams at the figures.
Parents and friends don ’ t tell her anything about it, they think they ’ re crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She passed her Abitur in the past year and lives with her friend.
A year ago the hallucinations stopped.
Since she contacted the psychologist Kasten on the internet, she knows that she is not crazy.
Delusion is also a work of art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from a stroll, he / she will most likely have hallucinations after a while, says Kasten.
I suspect that the brain is then underemployed and provides itself for its entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13 that the man she calls Papa is not her bodily father since she can think.
Since the same areas of the brain are active in visual and acoustic hallucinations, which also process real impressions and sounds, it is difficult to distinguish between those affected, such as Sarah K.. "Every experience", says Kasten, "takes place in the brain, the reality is represented there.
Hallucinations are also images that create the brain, so they work so real. "
Also nocturnal dream pictures considers box as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those of acute psychosis.
In contrast to schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their deceptions as unreal.
Box therefore advises its patients to appreciate the hallucinations also as a special ability.
Border state between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our very conscious world imaginary experience is mostly pathologized, says Michael Schmidt and Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the Florence Clinic for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy.
A psychosis is a serious, sorrowful illness, but it also contains positive, creative - delusion is also a work of art of despair.
Schmidt Degenhard has explored the so-called oneiroid form of experience, a special form of traumatic waking consciousness.
Oneiroids are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams, which the experienced person considers to be real and which he cannot distinguish from the waking state in retrospect.
The oneiroid state of consciousness arises in extreme traumatic or disease-related situations, for example in polyradiculitis and patients with full consciousness who experience motor paralysis.
When a person is threatened by self- and world-loss, for example by persistent, complete motionlessness, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with his own imaginary world, which is decoupled from reality, says Schmidt's Degenhard.
A kind of border state between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to deal with a situation in reality, a world change takes place, but the real situation is visualized in the imagination.
An intense form of meaning foundation and meaning in an intolerable situation that enables us humans to create their own capacity not to perish in a nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his Oneiroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" as a rescue operation of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness travels for days after a heart valve operation followed by a heart transplant, while his body is condemned to lack of movement on the intensive care unit.
Claussen dives into a self-created world, visits foreign times and places: he experiences himself as a bedridden, old man, on board a train anatorium, a robot watches over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages under nobles who produce drugs from blood.
Is abducted by a Greek on the motorcycle in his home country, surfing with his hospital bed in the firn snow of the Alps and hitting a Korean mafia.
He goes completely up in the imagined event, everything is real, even later in memory.
For Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dream is another state, he describes his experience.
Quite in contrast the memories from mental journeys are still clear to me after years and in minor details.
Significant and more intense even than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience shatters the horizon of our other life-world experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt and Degenhard.
Ultimately, oneiroids, psychosis, hallucinations and drug intoxication show how fragile our inner images of outer reality are also in the guard.
Any change in the state of consciousness, the psychologist summarizes castes, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be enriching.
The snowfall can come
Burda
Children should take over the publishing house at the age of 27
The new chief of publishing Kallen is an interim solution: Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children in the long term, he said to the Spiegel.
The holding company will continue to belong to 100 percent of the family.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the long term in the hands of his children.
Both children inherit at the age of 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, the 69 year-old told the Spiegel.
We have regulated the details as a precautionary measure.
The question of whether they are also active in the company arises only afterwards.
Also the question of whether they are able to do so.
You cannot set up 7,500 employees for your children if they are not sufficiently qualified.
This also kills the children and the company.
Burda announced on Thursday that he will withdraw from the Board of Directors as of January, and that he will be appointed his successor, Paul Kallen.
The 52 year old Kallen has been a board member of Burda since 1999.
First, he was responsible for technology.
Later, the Treasury department was responsible for corporate assets and, after Jürgen Todenhöfer left, direct marketing, foreign affairs, printing and finance.
For the first time, no family member is at the head of the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would be 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The designation of Kallen also served to "bridge 10, 15 years", according to Burda.
The holding should continue to belong to 100 percent of the family, said Burda.
With regard to the cases of fate and Schaeffler, Burda said that even family-owned companies are not safe from the downfall: "This always concerned families who were infected by a capital addiction that had completely speculated and thought that they could thus rise to the very big player.
My strategy was never.
He had "never had dreams of world power", says Burda.
I do not see myself as the political preceptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I do not want to play in the World League with 'Time', these shops have become too big.
Perfect beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now at your disposal.
At least that is what El Corte Inglés has been doing, which recently opened a shop with an area of more than 1000 m ² in the shopping centre in Callao (Madrid), where everything revolves around body care.
In the wellness area, which is located on the eighth floor, one finds among other prestigious companies such as Hedonai, who provide for a depilation with laser; Spaxión, with rooms to relax and for beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
There is also a food department that stands out for its tea house with more than 130 different types of tea.
Enjoy a relaxing massage together with your partner while enjoying a fantastic view of the capital city, or rent a relaxation area for two hours to get your own "beauty party" with eight friends and then relax in the whirlpool or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just some of the many possibilities Spaxión offers.
The total area is 250 m ², which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments as well as for the hydro therapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating surfaces.
The gym also has this kind of equipment, and there are also virtual trainers who take care of the training sessions of the customers and thus offer them a completely personal training.
You start a training session by entering a personal password on a touchscreen opposite the devices.
Afterwards, various videos show you how to perform your workouts correctly.
The head of the gym assures that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching exercises) are sufficient to train the body muscles.
After you have trained your body, if you want to pass by the hairdressing salon, the Luis & Tachi company has a room where treatments for the recovery of hair gloss, shine and health are offered for your hair in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the heart of the city, which is always open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. 365 days a year.
The most diverse décolletés
Christmas is coming closer and closer and so it is a good opportunity to copy the look of the stars and bring their festive dresses into our wardrobe.
The form of the décolleté, which is very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the points that needs to be considered.
Here are some proposals.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated décolleté. You can only advise against this.
Endesa and Barcelona by electric car
Together with the city of Barcelona, the electricity company Endesa has created the "LIVE Office".
This is a project to develop and promote electric cars in the Catalan capital.
The LIVE Office will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make agreements on mobility by managing, coordinating, subsidizing, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is being developed to promote electric cars and to summarize the opinions and measures of the sectors concerned.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transport of the future.
3 "Electrical cities"
However, Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville also participate in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to speed up the introduction of electric cars.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement aims to promote the activities of research and technological development in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities are, among other things, activities related to energy and, in particular, to its performance.
However, it is by no means the only initiative in which Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standardization groups throughout Europe and has a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of calm" for the automotive sector
President José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, the Spanish automobile industry, which is the largest exporter of the country, predicts "a horizon of calm".
Presenting the economic report for 2009 by the President of the Regional Council, Zapatero recalled the measures taken by the government to support the automotive sector during the year of government.
"Without a plan for the competitiveness of the automotive industry, we would have a panorama of neglect and closure of some of our main production plants," said the President.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of car manufacturers to continue producing in Spain in a very competitive industry, we can see a calm horizon for the future of this industry, which is our largest export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, which is part of the overall plan for the automotive industry (PIA), has provided EUR 800 million for projects by 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn have invested more than EUR 3 billion.
The head of government said that these investments were intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and procedures.
Zapatero also underlined the government ’ s efforts to stimulate demand, alluding to Plan 2000E, which is being applied in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and car manufacturers.
According to the head of government, this plan allows for an average 6% reduction in exhaust gases in new vehicles sold on the Spanish market, which in turn led to a "strong increase" in the registrations, which increased in November by "40%".
On 20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
Madrid hosts the first edition of the International Classic Motor Show, an exhibition for professionals and fans of the world of engines.

Mazda3 and Stop: Environmentally sound sportiness
Mazda wants to prove that sportiness is compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the automatic stop and start system of the Mazda3 model, named i and stop, a device that is currently only available for the 150 hp 2.0 petrol engine.
This second generation of Mazdas 3 stands out for its good grades in the overall picture.
The finishing, the design of the vehicle, the comfort, its road characteristics, the mechanics, the i...
All these aspects are "very good" in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats, you can see that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good grip.
The game of the steering wheel is also excellent.
When looking further at the unit, which consists of the instrument panel and the dashboard, you can see that Mazda is in the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design with a variety of buttons and switches in the spectacular colours red and blue.
This style reminds us partly of the style of the Honda Civics.
It can therefore be said without further ado that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, stand out from the sobriety of the German automobiles, especially the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
The passenger compartment of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the corresponding comfort, so that four adults can ride comfortably by car.
To all this comes a large and clearly shaped trunk.
The stop and start system is currently only available for the 2-litre gasoline engine with 150 hp and a 6-speed gearshift.
This motor is a real pleasure. It stands out for its fineness, its quiet noise, its performance and its low consumption.
And all those who don ’ t drive many kilometers a year should consider this one stop with gasoline engine because of its great comfort in gearshift and its low consumption, even if Mazda ’ s diesel models are the best-selling ones.
In terms of equipment, the so-called Sportive model, which is selected for the test drive, is a special feature, as it has a substantially larger number of elements from the standard equipment.
The standard equipment stands out above all by the Assistant for Changing the Track (RVM), which thus eliminates the dead angle, but also by the controls for traction and stability, the speed control, the light-sensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking, an independent air conditioning system, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and Audio and Bluetooth as well as the chrome-plated 17 inch rims.
In addition, this version also includes, as if that were not enough equipment, the package Premium, which contains the following for an additional 1,500 euros: in addition to other elements, especially the learnable Bixenon spotlight and the sound system BOSE with CD loader.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding with regard to the materials used, because of its driving behaviour and the variety of equipment.
In addition, those who do not travel many kilometers a year can also buy the i ´ Stop ´ version, which is only available with a 2.0 gasoline engine with 150 hp.
The only negative thing about this model is its somewhat high price, which lies between 21,770 euros for the model Luxury and 23,270 euros for the model Sportive.
In return for this high price, however, the Mazda3 offers us every day the highest driving pleasure.
A premiere with lots of glamour
L. A. rolls out the red carpet of sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine" the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as sexy, radiated more than ever. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as elegant as ever, chose a dark "Lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is limited, a device with which you can read only your e-mails, without a possibility to see certain attachments or to surf through the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame when it chose the magazine Time as one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is rather improbable, but the idea in itself is of interest to young people.
In contrast to the smartphones Peek costs only very little and has a very favorable flat rate, for example only half the price of the flat rate of an iPhone.
After the company has seen the success with it, it has brought two new devices to the market: one that is only intended for Twitter, the other with a lifelong free service for data, quite in contrast to Peek, where you have to pay a six times higher price.
Fonpeek, which was presented yesterday at the event Le Web, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same boundaries as its American counterpart, but it has a surprise.
The monthly entertainment price for the phone, about 12 euros a month, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to have to do without all the data in order to be able to read their emails as soon as you have crossed the border or if you are desperately looking for a café with WIFI (or a connection with Fon).
The idea of roaming with flatrate is incredibly seductive and should have been possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for stays abroad, but in my experience you already need a doctorate in physics and good glasses to read all the small print.
The European Commission's repeated criticism of affordable roaming rates for the whole of Europe has almost always been ignored.
Outside your country, you are always afraid to read your emails, and rightly so.
The fact that a small device like FonPeek (although it is always surprising that it has the name Fon, although it does not have Wifi / WLAN) can offer these types of tariffs means that the telephone providers have to rethink slowly but surely and start considering different ways of using their data network.
Kindle is another good example of this, its prices include downloading books and other requests on the Internet.
Without Vetrag and without hooks.
This is an Internet-enabled device and you pay for it only once, namely when buying, and not month after month.
And that is exactly what I expect from FonPeek one day, a possibility to buy with life-long internet access as Peek already offers in the USA.
And not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails with the phone, thank you.
But I expect this because I believe that it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The Fetish Color of Michelle
Yellow is without a doubt the favorite color of the American First Lady.
Already when Barack Obama took office as President of the United States, she appeared in a dress and a coat of this color and re-elected the same color to accompany him in his second most important moment in his life: the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore very similar models on both occasions: outside, that it was almost the same color - a shiny green-yellow -, the clothes consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat from the same fabric, and in addition she wore something large embroidered or a necklace.
It even goes so far that at first sight it seemed that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the model of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress at more than one occasion.
However, the two dresses are very different in the fabric type from which they are made.
At the inauguration she wore a lace dress and a patterned velvet in Oslo.
The accessories were also different: for the first time, green shoes with half-high heels and for the second time, a confined model, but gold colors.
The hairstyle was also different every time: The hair was put up as a hair wreath on this occasion, with the previous one she wore the hair open.
75% of working mothers have got problems at work because of their motherhood
Discrimination in work has increased in recent years, especially among the younger women who want to have children.
This is the result of a study carried out by CSIC in collaboration with the Institute for Women "The Fertility and Career of Women in Spain".
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt about this: 75% of working women see their career opportunities restricted on the labour market due to their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are large differences in the decision to establish a family and the number of children, depending on whether women work or not, and if so what kind of job they are doing.
Those of them who do no other work outside the house, work only half-day or have no fixed employment contract, are more likely to become mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women with a firm job, especially in the public sphere, postpone the founding of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"Women in the age group between 35 and 49 years with a permanent employment receive their first child on average only 3.7 years after the contraction, a figure that increases to 4.1 years for women with fixed employment who have taken longer to achieve this and who have realized their contraction and the first child only much later.
In addition, the type of work has a great influence on motherhood, albeit less than the calendar in terms of willingness to conceive, "explains the CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that must be taken into account in the age of women in marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, at the time of marriage and the first child, the higher the level of education.
This difference could also be found in women of the same age.
For example, women in the group aged between 35 and 49, depending on whether they have only primary or higher education, were on average their first mother at 25.1 or 32.1.
Furthermore, there is another difference between women, depending on their level of education.
Whereas the women who have graduated from primary school marry before their first permanent employment and receive their first child, the women with a middle or high school leaving certificate do it exactly differently and first seek a permanent employment and get married afterwards and then get their first child, notes Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris has recently added a new name to its all-envy list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and will also say the well-known advertising slogan "Because you are worth it".
The leading actress from "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actresses on an international level, will thus become another famous flagship, as before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her were the last to join this exclusive club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
Among the men, the cosmetics company also has only exceptional partners: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey's Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (actress of Evangeline in "Lost").
The award ceremony of the British fashion industry
The British have an important word to say in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today - met at the annual award ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
On this occasion they all appeared.
The ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted the best model this year.
The Poker Game by Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker of Aces" (Alfaguara, pictures by Fernando Vicente) the thirty x-rays of writers who accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, also in real life).
He does not use a foreseeable and fearsome genre (short biography, life and work), but seeks anxiousness to the glowing heart of the Creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicent saves neither terror nor enlightenment.
Besides that this book is a delicious reading pleasure, it is also a moving invitation to read and read again and again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
About Albert Camus: "When reading his pages I found out that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual impulse, just as I have always felt it, without having found words for it: the joy in contrast to the disastrous fate, the morality without guilt and the innocence without any God".
On Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in his blood, not in his mind, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a stunning poetic humor, without any sense, like the knife blade that almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was captivated by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, such as in her flesh, in whose flesh the emotions united due to adultery with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that consisted in coming into heaven on the way of perdition."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. This is one of the 80s summits in the world literature, you have to climb up the north wall, on the wall where the best mountaineers try again and again. "
About William Faulkner: "He was a funny cheat.
He sometimes said about himself that he was the inheritance of a landowner of the county and other times he said that he was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
Both dreams testified of a certain size. "
About Louis Ferdinand Céline: This writer recorded the insane cry, which was cried out from a bridge from that personality from Munich, so that his echo echoed deep into the night of the 20th century in his literary way. He made this on a journey, on which he fled from himself and with a speech full of violence implored posterity from the worms.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she knelt down and prayed: my revered God, I ask you to do everything in your power, so that I finally stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave these verses of Spencer are engraved: 'the sleep after the effort, / after the thunderstorm of the harbor, / the rest after the war, / after a rich life one finds favor with death."
About Virginia Wolf: "She always had her depression in her luggage.
The husband took it with complete normality when she told him that Eduard VII spied them between the azaleas or sang the birds in Greek.
There is no other case known where the man was so patient and in love with a neurotic woman whose literary talent was much greater than her madness. "
About Pío Baroja: "What else did Martín Santos do than try to inject Joyce into Baroja?
What did Benet intend if he did not bring Baroja to the arms of Faulkner?
What did Cela do, except to destroy the glory of that man, so that he can place himself on this platform? "
Fig aggression
My 70-year-old mother walked through our district in the village of Fuenlabrada last week, when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old ran next to her and our dog, our dog is a hybrid that we brought out of the shelter and weighs just six kilos, and then out of the blue they missed him two footsteps and seriously injured him.
Our indignation cannot be put into words, because it is incomprehensible to us, where fun is supposed to be against a small and helpless animal with a cheap aggression, which was of course carried out on a leash.
In addition, there is the suffocation that a woman who walked comfortably got when she wanted to rebuke these persons because of the incident, she even feared for her own life, because if such a madman attacks a dog, he will perhaps do the same with a woman, a child, an older gentleman or probably even with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighborhood at five o ’ clock in the afternoon on a quite ordinary Tuesday.
The dog has been howling all day long.
Of course, we have filed a complaint in a nearby police station, but we have great doubts as to whether this will bring anything at all and to prevent any prejudice from the outset, we would just like to clarify that the cowardly criminals were Spaniards.
Our indignation at what happened has led us to report this incident.
We cannot understand what must happen in the minds of these young people, that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on an animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect for animals and persons have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
In cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for Traffic Safety (Fesvial), the tyre manufacturer Michelin has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, especially among younger motorcyclists, as both companies announced today.
This initiative wants to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, since this is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which "covers far more than just designing and manufacturing products that become safer and safer with each day" and further reiterated that they also contribute with other actions educational and informative character to getting one step closer to this goal each day.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets on the motorcycle, which runs under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will distribute in a first phase posters to over 500 motorcycle workshops in order to achieve the best possible distribution.
To conclude, Michelin stressed that road safety is "a constant concern" of the company, and precisely for the reason that as a manufacturer of tyres they are always committed to two vehicles that must be one of their main objectives in the development of ever safer products.
The sale of small trucks is rising again
After almost two years, the automobile market for small vans finally begins to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% in 2008, and, even more importantly, they are the first ever increase after 22 consecutive months with a steady decline, according to the figures presented by the Anfac Manufacturer Association and the car dealer association Ganvam.
These good figures are, however, only to be enjoyed with great caution at the moment, as the reference data from November 2008, which were used for comparison, was a particularly bad sales year with a 60% decrease in the previous year.
However, it must be borne in mind that, apart from last month ’ s increase, the total approvals of these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures of the previous fiscal year.
A total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold since January, but all vehicles comprising the retail market are included: passenger cars, pick ups, vans, small vans and lighter trucks / chassis.
Furthermore, there are still the same clouds of thunderstorms in the sky, which affect demand the most, because even if some of the vehicles are bought by private individuals, the bulk of the sales goes to small and medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100% of all cases make the purchase with a third-party financing.
In addition to these restrictions, which are the consequence of credit institutions ’ spending, there are other factors to be included, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
In this panorama and in contrast to passenger cars, the financial support for the purchase of a vehicle of the plan 2000E did little to help.
This plan, however, is not only intended for private individuals, but also self-employed and small businesses have a right to buy a van of up to 3.5 tonnes with CO2 emissions that may not exceed 160 grams per kilometre driven, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday Ganvam reminded us that it is absolutely essential on the part of the state to pay special attention to these small trucks and, of course, also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The car dealer association predicts a similar year for 2010 to that of the past, for which it expects a sales failure (for passenger cars and off-road vehicles) of 19%.
Support for braking manoeuvres in critical situations is now mandatory
As in the case of the ABS anti-lock brake system and as in the case of ESP, the auxiliary systems for braking in emergencies must become a mandatory equipment in European cars.
In fact, they are already obligatory for all newly registered passenger cars and light vans, and for the remaining vehicles a period of grace has been set by the end of February 2011.
The aim of the measure decided by the European Union is to improve the protection of pedestrians, but these braking systems can also help prevent many rear-end accidents due to their operation.
The task of the emergency brake assistant is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical brake manoeuvre which the system recognizes on the brake pedal based on the brake strength carried out by the driver.
However, this system does not exert this pressure until the end.
According to an investigation commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, a third of the drivers involved in an accident were no longer able to step onto the brake pedal before the collision, and half of them had not slowed down with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The brake assistance, on the other hand, intervenes with maximum force in the brake system and thus reduces the braking time and therefore also the braking distance that a car travels during the braking process.
According to a study by the EU, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be prevented each year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency brake assist.
There would be even fewer accidents - it is expected that one in four accidents could be prevented from personal injury - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects obstacles (via radar or a camera) and warns the driver, while at the same time exerting a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver responds, the system will help him to increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not react to the warning and even if the collision is inevitable, the brake assist exerts the maximum pressure on the brakes to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors postpones the plan for Opel until January
While the staff of Opel ’ s factory in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) were already informed by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on the 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer points out that it takes more time to complete the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new Chairman of GM Europe, wants the affected party to agree to each and every point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, it may be that the final document, first submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries in which there are works, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
Contrary to this, GM is assured that it will make a decision on the sale of Saab in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American car manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to be in contact with some potential new buyers.
One of these buyers might be Geely, who would also like to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the Skyper premier sports car, which is backed by the Russian group Converg, is gaining ever stronger popularity.
If there was no agreement with any of these buyers, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold until then, will continue.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their newest and very expensive jewel, the engineers used the Boxster S as a basis and really managed to make it 80 kilos lighter, which means that he now weighs only 1,275 kilos.
In order to create something like this, they first renounced the automatic hinged roof, which was replaced by a canopy canopy with manual drive, which alone saved 21 kilos; thanks to the aluminium doors used in this model, such as those of the GT3, another 15 "disappear"; by removing the air conditioning system another 13; in addition, the fuel tank was reduced from 64 to 54 litres, thus saving another 7 kilos; by installing sporty Bacquet seats another 12 and with the light 19 inch rims again five saved.
Then, by abstaining from the CDR system, another six kilos less and by replacing the door handles with cloth handles, the missing kilo had been achieved.
Although it is also available with the double clutch transmission PDK, the test drive was carried out with a vehicle with 6 handheld transmissions, mainly on the smaller country roads of California, on mountain routes that were really very curvy.
With his driving behaviour one can give him only the mark perfectly.
However, the reduction of its weight has in no way led to it no longer being so safe on the road.
It ’ s rather the opposite: for a long time we haven ’ t tried such a small and lightweight model, but at the same time it gives you a feeling of great safety in the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles at a low gear in the required time, until we give him the orders to race, to brake, to recover and then to get everything out of his engine again...
The car does everything we can to him with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its steering, which is just as communicative as it is precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 boxer with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) has been very successful and you can increase it even more with the 'sport' option as well as with a system that can change the engine noise, which was already used for the first time with the Panamera.
Acceleration is unimaginably brutal, no matter whether standing out or accelerating again.
The suspension is strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the country roads, on which we drove with the Boxster Spyder, was already quite damaged, but the car mastered the potholes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the whole track; and that although we found ice at dawn and slit in the morning on some of these curves.
In summary, one can say that it is an ultra-light car, a car with which one has an indescribable driving pleasure, as it is otherwise rather rare and in it there is much more than just a small improvement of the Boxster S.
The car will be launched in February 2010 and cost 70,831 EURO.
Bag Girl
The singer, a Busenfreundin of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the cosmetic line Coco Cocoon and a casual tray at the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same stiffness of her neck as her bags of Chanel.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she is a "Bag Girl".
The Basconia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral celebrated, despite the many unusual players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, an outstanding triumph with 82 to 91 on his visit to the complicated football field of the Maccabi Electra and thus comes to the first place within his group after the grand appearance of Mirza Teletovic, who was the best of his team with eight triple (29 in the evaluation).
The team from Vitoria could replace the significant failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of effort and teamwork, even if they had to wait until the bitter end for their victory.
The great hits out of the perimeter with 16 rated triple contributed significantly to their final victory.
The game began with the leadership of the blue red, who from the beginning sat down at the top of the scoreboard.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria already came out of the perimeter, one could already suspect that they had come to the playing field with well warmed wrists.
They were English and Teletovic, who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, except that the team from Álava opted for an internal game of Barac and for the game of Eliyahu, who was received on his return to the team with whistles and applause, which is his home, to extend their advantage further until the break (34) 43.
Teletovic already began to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, even though the "minus six" rating of splitters suggests that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, despite the clear advantage during the break, the game was far from decided and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Vitorians that not everyone wins on their playing field, and thanks to the constantly attacking "hand of Elías" they came back into play.
Eidson and Pnini played a decisive role in turning the rudder around the "Yellow" (50 to 49).
Even more disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but anything but dead, had to prepare a few moves with accuracy to get air again and at one of them suddenly came the gun of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triple and with the support of English and Ribas made sure that on the display board again calming distance of (54 to 67) was displayed, which the host could beautify at the end of the third quarter with (57 to 67).
The Alavese were exposed in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away the victory they had honestly earned in the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson resigned, not the best of their team, and tried to give their team power again by three points from the line (70 to 77).
Nevertheless, and although splinter was put off because of Fouls, the team of Ivanovic did not give up, defended itself well and although the Israelis still caught up in the last minute (80 to 85), the game had already a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from being given the forehead
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece against Olympiacos and had to surrender the lead in group B of the Euroleague to him, in a game that was characterized by the failures on the part of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the indoor game, which facilitated the victory of the Greeks.
The Málaga team was not afraid of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship, nor of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
The Andalusians were able to start dreaming thanks to their presented game in first quarters. An aggresive defense and three consecutive triple, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, blinded the hosts with 12 and 18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the first Unicaja, even though the local team with an interiors game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed to show that the scoreboard in the 13th minute was 22-20 in their favour, the minute in which almost the fighting between the two Americans Beverley and Williams came due to an action and therefore both were disqualified.
The Greek team finally started to get warm and its superiority on both halves of the game, while the departure of the Englishman Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three self-caused mistakes of Carlos Jiménez left clear marks on the Unicaja.
Among their players in the inner field and the Lithuanian forerunner Linas Kleizas, with his triple, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44 and 32.
Catching up was impossible
The third quarter of the game was characterized by many attacks against the Olympiacos team, which, despite its 19 losses, proved superior and even managed to compensate for the difference between the game played in Malaga with 66 and 48 in the 27th minute, which in turn caused the leadership within the group to fluctuate.
Unicaja tried to ignore the many failures and the elimination of the Scottish Robert Archibald injured during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja came in the 31st minute thanks to the lead and the triple of Cook and the use of Lewis again some hope for 66 and 57.
Nevertheless, it was actually impossible, because the Olympiacos, as soon as he attacked and showed his superiority with centimeters within the basket area, was not to be braked.
The Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed in the 37th minute to raise the basket difference to 81 and 62 and Unicaja had to give himself beaten and had to resign the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you earn on Facebook because of your profile?
Facebook users can now experience their salary through the new Trovit application, the search engine with the most advertisements of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain, which they should earn because of their profile.
The tool "How much should you earn?" calculates the salaries of the users on the basis of more than 140,000 job offers that are available at Trovit in Spain. Users can use a form in Facebook to enter their profession, professional experience, age and the city where they work.
Already after one week, after the application was available for the first time, the search engine found that the Spanish worker on average feels "poorly paid", explains the product Trovit manager, Albert Ribera, in a press release.
The Spaniards are the worst paid according to the data that Trovit has through its search engines in Great Britain and France.
A British programmer gets an annual gross salary of 45,226 euros and a Frenchman 31,059, unlike the 24,000 euros earned by a Spaniard.
As a result, a truck driver has an annual net salary of 34,247 euros in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid work in Spain is that of a waiter with 11,592 euros net annually, followed by the work of a seller with 14,725 euros and that of a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most searched places on the Internet in the last three months are that of a driver, half-day jobs and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya ’ s stay in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President withdrawn from office must leave diplomatic representation no later than 27 January 2010, if his mandate expires officially
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian Embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that before that date he must have left the embassy where he had found asylum since 21 September.
"He is aware that he has to go on 27 January, because his mandate expires on that day and he has to look for a new accommodation."
The station also quoted the former president of Brazil, who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the fixed date: "My point of view is to go as soon as possible, logically with the backing of the government of Brazil," Zelaya said on the phone.
After the elections on 29 November (in which Porfirio Lobo emerged as the winner), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, he tried this week to get refuge in Brazil.
This failed, however, due to Zelaya ’ s refusal to recognize the status of an asylum seeker, whom the de facto government chaired by Roberto Micheletti wanted to impose on him.
Thank you.
After the most enticing days since last spring, when asset inflation was the dominant mood in the markets, the uncertainty on the markets has returned, which is by no means surprising, as this is their natural state, in an environment in which brokers make decisions about a naturally uncertain future.
The measure used to stabilise the markets was to settle the debt with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly to leave the liquidity free hand at interest rates that move around zero, so that banks can buy assets to settle.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets are almost over and, without calling into question their heterodox liquidity policy, are beginning to spread some sand into the gear, as BCE näc has already done with its annual auction next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to sustain economic recovery without these heterodox measures, and we are witnessing a reversal in reducing risk premiums.
The volatility of the stock exchanges and the differences in corporate bonuses are rising again, even if they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to nationalize private risks, and public debt is rising again.
Quality is now restored, and the US, Japan, and Germany are the preferred haven for investors, leading to an increase in the eurozone countries ’ differences in Germany.
Spain was so far hardly affected by this episode of instability, but then came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new revision down in terms of Spain's assessment.
On the other hand, some uncertainty does not harm to silence the defenders of moral risk, who had once again tried to raise awareness among the leaders of world economic policy about what they had caused, because they had slowed down the devastating effects that the limitation of credit had led to the loss of jobs when they were supposed to decide on a new day of thanksgiving.
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai indicates a tribal war between the Emirates to restore power in the Emirates, and the development in Greece was also foreseen earlier.
A government that conceals public debt, elections, and a new government that is pulling together.
Prodi made it to Durão Barroso in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal.
It makes no sense for Ecofin Hungary to save Hungary from non-compliance with its foreign payments earlier this year, thus allowing a euro member country to no longer fulfil its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to include its citizens in the need for exceptional measures in order to maintain the stability of state funds.
Yes, as expected, we are facing an episode of normalization of risk premiums, after some excesses on too high amounts, that would now be within the expected.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in public debt increase at the same rate as European corporate bonuses.
However, if European differences were to decrease and Spanish differences continue to increase, this would be a special Spanish risk.
Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the local early indicators force a large part of the market research institutes to prefer their recovery scenarios and correct their scenario upwards for 2011, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which come back with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all this does not promise a long life span despite warnings.
Once again it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although at the moment it is called for "caution when driving".
Connecting branches
The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to appear before Parliament's subcommittee yesterday, where the strategy on Spain's energy supply is being debated over the next two decades.
After his appearance, followed by Rafael Villaseca, Chairman of Gas Natural and Fenosa, Galán gave the press a few points about what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the Chairman of Iberdrola, Spain will have to invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and another 60 billion by 2030, provided that the current nuclear power plants will continue to operate.
If this were not the case, the investments needed would not amount to 60 billion, but to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that we should no longer invest in increasing energy generation capacity, but in distribution networks and international alliances.
From 2020, the issue will change and the performance should be increased.
His proposal focuses on gas and coal plants with facilities to capture carbon dioxide and, of course, on renewable energies.
In this case it assumes that 18,000 MW more are needed, under the condition of course by other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the proposal for a sustainable economy, which has just been adopted by the government, is in line with what his company has called for, did not want to say anything about this law, how to create incentives for national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all policies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "in the long term we are clearly focusing on this direction, despite some" individual "measures, as the chairman of Iberdrola called them.
Be it as it may, Galán believes that decisions on investments should already be taken now, even if they are long-term, because it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework must be created to tackle them.
Ferrovial receives the "Handling" from Aer Lingus at ten airports
Ferrovial ’ s subsidiary for ground-based services, Swissport, is the preferred partner of Aer Lingus, an Iranian airline, for baggage services at ten European airports where they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, on which no figures have yet been announced, is set for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Government of Castile and La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares yesterday signed a protocol for cooperation to create an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructures.
The alliance plans to invest 20 million by 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to investigate energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with Hochtief and Bouygues for its first highway construction in Australia
Acciona is fighting for the approval of its first motorway in Australia, a market in which they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (approximately 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief are its competitors.
A 5-kilometer tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself as a construction company and highway operator in the country.
The municipality wants to have the construction completed by the end of 2014.
After the administration decided for a publicly private cooperation (PPP is the English abbreviation) to advance the project according to a business plan established by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a definitive list of candidates for the construction and the toll office administration.
In anticipation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investment amounts to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.047 billion euros), with three consortia competing in the last phase, mainly European construction companies.
The group named Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of Australia ’ s largest construction companies, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the best civil engineering specialists.
The Northern Direct consortium, made up of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, which is responsible for infrastructure and the French Bouygues group, opposes the Acciona team.
The third and final consortium, which is in the narrow election, is called LBRJV, made up of the capital of Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACS), the native Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specializes in public construction.
The Australian market for infrastructures promises huge construction works and privatizations, but it has a hurdle to overcome, as you only get access by buying a local construction company.
A strategy that the mentioned companies Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, have followed and which has yet to be pursued by the Spanish construction giants.
Even ACS has access to this market only through its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of the Leighton.
Millions of assets
Acciona focuses on this geographical area of utmost importance for the sector in which it is already well known for its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry.
Among other assets, it already has its largest windmill park (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies that have been commissioned to build and manage Adelaide's desalination plant with a budget of 700 million.
His intention is now to consolidate in these two areas and to use these synergies to gain access to the construction and infrastructure branches.
The purpose of the underground toll route, which is promoted by the Brisbane Infrastructure Office and called Northern Link (Northern Zubringer), is to connect the western motorway in Toowong with the Kelvin Grove bypass road (see map) on a length of 5 kilometres through tunnels, which is the largest measure for the reduction of congestion on Brisbane roads.
The roadmap issued by the city administration provides for the award for summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Even if this toll route is already to open up to traffic in the last months of 2014, it is expected that the construction works will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government is contributing 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) to the financing.
For Hochtief Brisbane is ready for business.
Australia is repeatedly awarding considerable contracts to Hochtief, which signed a contract with the government of 154 million yesterday.
ACS will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fiber-optic cables through its local subsidiary Leighton.
This improvement will create fast Internet access for 400,000 people and will employ the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the construction project of the King George Tower with 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. Construction work has not yet begun and Hochtief has received 129 million.
Also in the UK, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and management of two schools for 25 years.
Initial investments amount to 75 million euros.
FCC receives contract for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, has provided a total of EUR 64.5 million for the construction of a 2.1 kilometre tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia.
The company received this contract only a few days after it had received the contract for the construction works for the extension of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) of more than 130 million.
In this way, Alpine is strengthening its experience in tunnelling.
The start of construction work is planned for the beginning of 2010 and its implementation will be over 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore receives advertising from Renfe
Renfe has attributed advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Sra. Rushmore for a sum of approximately three million euros annually, the railway company announced.
In this contract there is also the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore was selected among 16 agencies, which presented sch to this competition advertised by Renfe, of which 4 came to the final round, among them TBWA, which was responsible for advertising in the last three years.
From now on Sra. Rushmore will be commissioned with the design and production of the campaigns.
Penalty over 63 million for France Télécom due to the suspension of the competition.
France's competition regulator has fined France Télécom more than EUR 63 million for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean.
According to the authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition in fixed and mobile networks by signing exclusive contracts, price plans and loyalty programmes for consumers in the margins of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than EUR 560 million in fines since 1994 for obstructing its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has even been increased, as the authority monitoring competition believes that France Télécom has committed similar violations in the past and has therefore fallen back.
Application trading
On the other hand, the subsidiary of the French company has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application trade page on the Internet in order to increase revenue from transactions that do not originate from the telephone connection.
In principle, this Orange website is active in France and the UK.
We have to wait until 2010 for this victory to be available in other countries, such as Spain.
Since the start of the Champions League, the game has brought 476.4 million to Madrid and Barça.
Since its inception in 1992, the Champions League has become a source of income for the football club.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have since taken 476.4 million, bringing them the third and fifth place of football clubs that have earned the most money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
Winning UEFA ’ s Champions League not only brings fame, it is also one of the main sources of income of the major clubs.
According to UEFA, the league has distributed up to 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) who have participated in this event since its founding in the 1992 / 1993 season.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The white club is in the third place in Europe, which has earned the most money through its participation and which, in addition to the AC Milan, is the only one to win the trophy three times.
The reigning Catalan champion and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992 took fifth place.
The list lists Manchester United and Bavaria Munich, two teams that also received the most money by participating in the last Champoins League.
And that, although they have lost against Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only in third place of the countries that could take money through the champions, although it has more titles than any other (five, unlike four bie Italy, three at England and two at Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated money sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
In this financial year, the organisation, chaired by Michel Platini, anticipates revenues of 1,090 million from the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA plans 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs participating in the qualifying round (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who fought for participation received 3.8 million by their mere presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they contested.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 Euros) and for a draw (400,000 per team). Clubs that have entered the Eighth finals each receive three million; the four that have entered the quarterfinals receive 3.3 million.
The last four get 4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, unlike the second, who receives 5.2 million.
A football club receives at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million in fixed income.
Barça in turn earned 2.5 million with his victory at the European Supercup in August.
However, there are also variable payments for which 337.8 million are earmarked.
This money is allocated proportionally to the value of each individual television market.
The Spanish is one of the first and has 4 assigned places.
Last year ’ s champion receives 40% of the money allocated, 30% of the second, 20% of the third place and 10% of the fourth place.
The other part will be distributed according to the number of games they play at this year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% stake in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa group has yesterday leached through details of the purchase offer of shares with which it intends to acquire an upper limit between 25 and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not force them to make a public tender (opa) due to the number of shares.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per share, which is paid out for ten years and with an interest rate of 1% annually due to this shift.
Yesterday, Sos AG closed shares with 1.85 Euro, which is why Nueva Rumasa rated the company 18% below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The Jeréz Group gives shareholders a period of 15 days to report their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV assured that it had not been informed about this offer, although the company Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had entered into contact with the authority.
At a conclusion, the deposit would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure its management.
The Jesús and Jaime Salazar brothers have announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of the internal audit in an attempt to remain on the sidelines of possible purchase offers and the judicial disputes of his former managers.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a high position in the food company.
It is a newly created post directly under the chairperson of the group.
This is anything but free of polemics because the company is involved in a judicial battle on suspicion of diverting more than 230 million from Sos to other companies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be ruled out that Sos will postpone further capital over the next few months.
With regard to the credit of the Salazar, the former advisors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) appeared yesterday before the National Assembly and confirmed that they had approved the postponement of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV approves Paternina's public exclusion policy presented by investment company Mer
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public exclusion policy for Federico Paternina presented by the investment company Mer last 9 October.
The supervisory authority stated that it approved this tender after it had been proven that the conditions conform to the legally binding laws and thus the content of the declaration submitted, following the amendments made last 2 December, can be considered "sufficient".
CNMV has also announced that this offer aims to acquire 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of EUR 7.65 per share, which in turn is 8.95% of the share capital consisting of EUR 6,142,786 in shares admitted on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
Furthermore, it has been announced that 5,592,778 million shares have been fixed, which cannot be transferred in any way until the tender has been completed and whose price has been fixed by Federico Paternina in accordance with the legally binding laws.
New programs to review vehicles
In these days of storms and accidents do not only earn the car workshops
Every day, thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are towed to the workshops, where an expert must assess the damage caused and the cost of the repair.
Not a single accident is the same and calculating the cost of parts and working hours can be a lengthy and complicated task.
The calculation of repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros per hand, including parts and working hours, can take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer science tools, it is a matter of minutes
Therefore almost 100% of the experts use these types of systems.
The service providers and application providers for the evaluation of accidents and repairs collect the information they receive from the manufacturers in order to process them afterwards and offer them to their customers in the form of a useful program.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all assessments are produced with their products.
The other two companies that compete with the tool ’ s market for review and preparation of a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by the manufacturers is far from easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Sales Manager of Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers work together, each of them providing the information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is increasing, to the point that over the last five years more versions, variants and motorization have been launched than in the previous fifteen years.
As soon as a new car enters the market, work begins for the companies.
It is a laborious task, because each individual of the thousands of vehicle parts must be catagolized and its price entered.
In addition, each model creates an "intelligent" graphic image on which you can "click" different parts of the vehicle.
If this is a much sold model, the work can be completed in one week if the procedure proceeds quickly.
If it is a less common car, it can take up to three or four months. Currently, Audatex has 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain with full information.
Among the more exclusive models, for example, they have information about the Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the vehicle fleet driving on the roads, it is more than 99%.
In order to carry out the documentation work and the production of databases, Audatex has eight worldwide distributed centres (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specializes in certain brands.
The national headquarters are located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros annually in the development of these databases.
Every month they collect 2.5 million data and their customers receive updates every second day.
The development of this enormous flow of information enables companies to use it in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, but depending on the country there are also tools for managing scrap parts or for calculating the file or residual value of a car.
The only company that informs about a leader about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
When looking through the products that Audatex offers, you can easily get an overview of the kind of support that it gives the industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, whereby the star of the products AudaPlus is a standard solution for assessing accidents for the experts.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the painting prices.
This tool is paid according to the purpose of use, i.e. for each expert report.
Most expensive it will be for customers who use it rarely, maximum ten times a month, namely 5.75 euros per month.
On the other hand, each insurance company that produces thousands of expert opinions negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, one can completely identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran from the assembly line, using the chassis number alone.
AudaGlass deals with the vehicle discs, and AudaSubastas is an Internet service open to the specialist market, which can be used for vehicles that have been declared a total damage.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, in carrying out geodemographic analyses or in obtaining information about the deviations by brand and model.
For example, it is possible to investigate how many models of a particular car brand had to enter the workshop due to breakdowns or how many of them were involved in a serious accident in a certain period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to developing this type of computer tools.
Among others, it sells Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images in the same way, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the group Einsa, which was founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the evaluation of damage, breakdowns or maintenance of vehicles.
The GT leader for expert opinions is a reference product on the market.
They cooperate with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 reviewers and 53 insurance companies.
Their business volume has increased with 20% annually in the last three years and in 2008 sales amounted to 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year they started to go to the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex, on the other hand, was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to sources of the company, 62% of their business is in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% are in North and South America. They cooperate with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
Total sales in the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) amount to 557 million dollars, 3.35 more than in 2008.
The company has revenue of EUR 19.1 million, 7.2% more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1 billion on the stock exchange and today its shares are traded to a value of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, they have been on the New York Stock Exchange and part of the reference index Standard & Poor.
Auction of accident cars on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Autoonline group bought a platform on the Internet for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of 59.5 million euros for 85% of the capital of the company, which could increase next year to the remaining 15%.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and added value, with the possibility of gaining access to a huge international market.
This review and purchase service applies exclusively to industry professionals, such as insurance companies, experts, car rental companies, workshops, scrap yards and car dealers, who have to be registered before their activities.
This platform was founded in Germany in 1996 and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany alone.
Its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
Today, the website has more than 1,500 registered vendors and 4,000 reviewers.
3,000 ads are managed every day and 100 new ads are added every day on the Spanish market.
According to the Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose chassis number has been unregistered may no longer drive on the roads, but certain parts that are not damaged may be used as spare parts.
By contrast, cars with historical value may be re-registered, even if they have been unregistered after difficult administrative procedures.
Cost estimate of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda tool, Audatex ensures that the user receives a cost estimate in just four steps: identification of the vehicle, search of the spare part, creation and creation of a cost estimate.
Easy handling of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially to convince older professionals who are more or less opposed to the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger vehicles, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 small vans and 44 trucks.
Of course you need a computer with internet connection for use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified on the basis of the chassis number, a graphic of the respective model appears and after that the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of working hours, surcharges or discounts and thereafter he can print out the cost estimate and pass it on to his customer.
However, AudaTaller is not a tool for evaluating AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop does not have estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool is 350 euros per year, an amount that the customer can pay without further ado.
The company Audatex is currently working on offering these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that Automechanics have been waiting for for a long time, as you can choose a door with it, for example, and then turn the picture completely to look at the inside.
