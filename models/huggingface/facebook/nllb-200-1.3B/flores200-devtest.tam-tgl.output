This confirms the already widely discussed theory that only a few dinosaurs had wings, and also provides details on colour and three-dimensional structure that are not usually given by descriptive fossil remains.
The scientists say that the surface of the animal's fin was a brownish-brown color and the underside a light or carotenoid color.
The discovery provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
As the dinosaur feathers did not have stems in a developed state, it was called a rachis, but had other features of the feathers - barbs and barbules - researchers speculated that the rachis and these other features may have been a later evolutionary development.
The structure of the wings suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for controlling heat or for display. Although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, researchers suggest that the model shows a developed wing, not that of a hummingbird.
Although this is a small dinosaur tail, the results of the study suggest that it has adult scales, and it is not on the back of a chicken tail.

below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized food like rabbits, horned deer and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including domestic cats) eat a wide variety of small insects, mice, fleas, and birds.
The secret to their success is the idea that each cat has a special job to do so as not to compete with the others.

When a small crowd (a small population) breaks away from a large crowd (if they cross a mountain or a river or if they move to a new island where they can't easily come back) they often find themselves in a different environment than they were before.
In this new environment, there are different resources and different competitors, so the new crowd will need different features or modifications to be stronger competitors than they needed before.
The real population is never going to change, and they need adaptations today as they did in the past.
The new population is constantly adapting to a different new environment over time, and therefore, they appear to be different from the rest of the population.
Eventually, thousands or millions of years later, the two populations will be too different to be called the same species.
This process we call speciation, the creation of a new species, and speciation is an inevitable outcome of evolution.

If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that there's a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
"The original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776 is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence. The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document".

So, this encoding could have been just added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the wars that followed liberated the north of France, but the east was still unliberated.
"It was ruled by the 'Wichy' French, who in the 1940s made peace with the Germans and worked with the border crossers rather than fight them".

Within two weeks, the American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were heading back towards Germany.
Civilization is the only culture where a large group of people work together and live together in unity.
Civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, and civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means country or province of the country, and it defines the extent of society in some way.
City-states are the precursors of nations.A civilized culture means the sharing of knowledge across generations, the enduring cultural footprint, and the fair transmission.

It had no power to regulate taxes and customs between the states.

The German national football team, together with Italy's national football team, is the second most successful team in the world, and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, knife fighting, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 car racing.
Winter Games are very popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in the International Games and the Olympic Games.
Japan has over 7000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world.

Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors recorded the name of the island they passed through as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwest Taiwan, initiating a shift in tribal grain production methods, employing Chinese laborers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces seized control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, declaring Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.

Machu Picchu has three main structures: the Intuwata, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of Three Windows.


35mm, for example, is the most commonly used still photography format in the world, and it was the dominant film format in the days of analog film.
It is still produced today, but more importantly its aspect ratio was obtained by digital camera image sensor patterns.
actually the 35 mm shape, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high is a bit confusing.
The aspect ratio of this pattern (dividing by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is 3:2.

The rule of thirds, often teased, is a simple guideline for generating energy when you have a size order in a photograph.
The competent place for the main subject is the point at which the lines that divide a shape into three verticals and three cubes meet. (See example.)
In this period of European history, money became relevant and powerful, and the Catholic Church came under scrutiny.
Over a thousand years, Christianity has built Europe beyond its linguistic and cultural differences.
The power that permeated it affected everyone from the king to the common man.

The central authority of the churches has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth in one place has led many to question whether fundamental principles are being fulfilled.
The protests broke out, and Britain launched a naval blockade of Germany.
The siege violated generally accepted international law, codified in many international treaties of the past two centuries, but the strategy proved effective in cutting off key military and civilian supplies.
UK buried net mines in international waters to prevent any ships from entering certain parts of the sea, putting neutral ships at risk.
The tactic had little effect, and Germany expected a similar result for unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the general mentality of most citizens and nations was one of peace and solitude.
The nations that saw the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I wanted to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents in his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batcheler (his manager at his previous job) to give to Thomas Edison.

Triple Emperors was a bloody period in ancient Chinese history, where thousands of people fought and died to sit in the highest office of the Great Palace in Xi'an.
The adoption of the metric system, the transition from dictatorship to republic, nationalism and the belief that the country is not dependent on individuals, but on the people, have many social and political consequences.
After the revolution, all the professions have made it possible for all the male applicants, the most ambitious and successful, to advance.

The French Revolution also sparked revolutions among the oppressed working class in other countries.
"Muhammad was deeply involved in matters beyond the world. He frequently went to the cave on the hill of 'Nur' (light) to meditate, which was later called 'Hira'".
He painted a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual aspirations in a cave that has not been eroded by time.
The cave was located on top of a (1) hill north of Mecca, completely isolated from the rest of the world.
actually, it's not easy to find it even if you know it's there. once you get inside the cave, it's total isolation.
You can't see anything except the clear, beautiful sky above and surrounded by many mountains. From inside the cave, you can only see or hear very little of the world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the Seven Wonders of the World.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BCE, is one of several large pyramidal structures built to honor the late pharaoh.
"The Giza Plateau or ""Gisa Necropolis"" in the Egyptian Valley contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Spikes".
The Great Pyramid was built in honour of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honour the wives and family members of Khufu.
"The ""top bow"" was like a V and the ""bottom sell"" was like a steeple or a square that had lost its bottom".
If you start at the top you have to press the arrow, and if you start at the bottom you have to pull the bow (where your hand is holding the arrow).
A lower bow is strong and emphatic, whereas an upper bow is normally low-pitched.

The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two younger children, (11 year old Marie-Thérèse, four year old Louis Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were driven from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789, by a mob of shopkeepers.
On their way back to Paris, a mob surrounded the carriage, shouting and threatening the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage.
(1) At one point, the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles was shown by a mob to a frightened politician.
The war costs of the US occupation of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime for the bulk of their expenses and the interest on the bonds of the Philippine government through the Wall Street Bank.
Of course, the basic gains of US imperialism may have been the massive profits of exploitation from the Filipino people.
To understand Templars, you have to understand the context that led to the creation of the organization.
The period in which the events occurred is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The Early Middle Ages, before the High Middle Ages and the Late Middle Ages, all of which traditionally ended around 1500.
TECHNOLOGICAL DETERMINATION
"Textures of the principles of technology follow a path that is past cultural or political influence and express two (2) ideas that the ""effects"" of technology on society are more natural than social impact".
For example, one might say that the motor car is the inevitable driver of road development.
However, nationwide road connectivity is not economically feasible for just a few cars, so new production methods are being developed in an attempt to reduce the cost of car ownership.

The greatest aspect of cultural commitment was in Romanticism, which was derived from writers like Goethe, Ficte and Schlegel.
As for romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time those geography-related customs and culture emerged, and their harmony with society was superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Paris, known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe in Constantinople.
It was at the height of its popularity from about 400 A.D. to 1100 A.D.
The decline began in the 12th century, largely because the Crusaders returned with more valuable silk and spices than the Byzantine markets had provided.
at the time, the title of the capital of civilization was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style, which was prevalent between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Themes were initially heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, because of the slow communication channels, Western styles may be 25 to 30 years behind.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subculture helps to unite like-minded people who feel they are being ignored by social norms and to develop an identity for themselves.
Subcultures may be unique due to the age, race, class, location and/or gender of the members.
The defining characteristics of a subculture can be identified by language, origin, religion, politics, gender, geography, or a combination of many other claims.
Members of a subculture often shoot their membership through the use of their distinctive and distinctive style of fashion, behavior, and language.
The best way to convey the importance of socialization is to reclaim children who have been abused by children or adults, who are not used to public outdoors, to misfortune and humiliation.
"Such children are called ""feral"" or rude. Some rude children are held back by the public (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child also occurs due to the rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical disability by the parents".
The wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or fled.
others are said to have been raised by animals, others are said to have lived in the wild.
When raised entirely by nonhuman animals, the wild child completely adopts the behaviour of the domesticated animal, such as fearing humans or being indifferent.
process, making learning easier and more fun. Scaffolding goes one step further.
Scapefold is not a learning method, but rather provides support for individuals who are using a new computer to gain new learning experience or start a new project.
The scaffold can be both real and virtual, i.e. the author is a scaffold as well as the paper clip man in the Microsoft Office.
The Virtual Scaffolds are designed internally in the software and should be in a way that questions, stimulates and explains practices that students may find challenging to handle on their own.
Children are also placed in foster care for various reasons, including neglect, harassment, and threatened money laundering.
No child has to grow up in a carefree, merciless, uneducated environment.
We believe that foster care is a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system is committed to providing a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable healthcare.
The expectation is that the foster insurance will cover all the needs that were lacking in the previous home.
Internet brings together the elements of public relations and of individual communication.

learning and socialization are the main drivers of Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"While IME and Miccourt analyzed the reactions of the audience to the websites, they found both ""personal engagement"" and ""continuous relationships"" as new active elements".
The use of video led to important discoveries in subtle emotional expression and facial gestures that lasted only a few seconds.
In particular, it is said that by correctly interpreting the content of a person's micro-emotions, it is possible to detect whether he is lying.
Oliver Sachs, author of The President's Speech, points out that the integrity of people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can be accurately measured.
He even suggests that such abilities to replicate human behaviour might be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
20th century research has shown that there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutations add new genetic mutations and selection removes it from the said mutation type.
The divide between the two generations is mixed and varied by division and restructuring.

also, failure can lead to severe consequences for developmental depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant nutrients are proteins found in leaves and beans, which are difficult for mammals like us to digest unless we cook them.
The animals, on the other hand, are easily digested (ants, snails, eggs), but they also have high-quality protein supplements with all the amino acids they need.

Sleep disorder is when you wake up from your normal sleeping time for some purpose and fall back to sleep after a while (10-60 minutes).
You can do this easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring back memories without waking you up completely.
lf you're gonna stop your watch when you're sleeping, just put it on the other side of the room and force yourself to get up and stop it.
Other biochemically based choices include drinking lots of fluids (especially water, tea, well known urinary secretion) before bedtime, which prompts us to wake up and urinate.
The degree of inner peace a person has is related to the degree of tension in one's body and spirit.


Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it was extended through the Maha Path of Love and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
The principles of Tibetan Buddhism are very simple, with Kundalini Yoga, meditation and love that envelops everyone.

Two years after the war ended, the former allies had now become enemies and the Cold War had begun.
It continued for the next 40 years, with fake forces, from Africa to the Asian battlefields, to Afghanistan, to Cuba, and so on.
September 17, 1939, Polish defenses were already broken, and the hope was to rebuild the crossing of the Roman bridge.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete overnight by the entry of more than 800,000 troops from the Soviet Union's Red Army. The invasion of eastern parts of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Transport by ship is the most efficient way to transport people and goods across the sea.
The traditional task of the navy is to ensure that your country maintains its ability to evacuate its people and goods, while at the same time, it is their job to block your enemy's ability to evacuate its people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII, where the Americans tried to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly U-boat types, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, the Germans might have taken over Britain just as they had taken over the rest of Europe.

The ancient cultures and tribes knew how to access milk, hair, meat and skin with ease.

Wagonways were built in England in the early 16th century.
The wagon tracks had only wooden parallel panels, allowing the horses to pull them at extreme speed and to pull more weight than the rough rough roads.
Early on, cross-legs were introduced to hold the tracks. However, it was felt that with a gradual iron bar on top, the tracks would be more powerful.
This was a common practice, but it also caused a lot of wear and tear on the wheels of the iron wagons.
Over time, wooden wheels evolved into iron wheels. In 1767, the first complete iron railway was introduced.
The earliest known form of transport was walking, and humans began walking with the appearance of Homo erectus two million years ago.
their ancestors, the astralopedics, were not straightforward.
Although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago, the bipedal speciality has been found in the fossils of the Astrolabeidae as early as 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago.
We can start living more in harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, we can become activists to reduce future impacts.
It's like symptomatic therapy in many ways, but if we don't want a temporary solution, we need to find the root cause of the problem and disable it.
It is clear that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advances of mankind, and the problems have increased due to the large population and the very luxurious lifestyle of humans.

"150 to 200 copies were made overnight, and are now called ""Tunnel Bracings"".
The first public reading of this document was written by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
George Washington received a copy on July 6, and he read it to the troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 pages wide of the present-day Tunalp are the oldest surviving copies of the document.

n't a lot of people think they're dinosaurs because they have wings and they can fly.

They have scales and claws, which lay eggs, and they walk on both hind legs like the T-Rex.
All computers in use today are based on processing information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A (1) binary number can have only one value, i.e., 0 or 1, in two (2) and these numbers are referred to as binary digits or bits, in computer sentences.
The symptoms of vomiting are too common to be diagnosed immediately.
The best sign of indoor toxicity might be the open container of medication or household chemical toxins.
For a specific poison, see the label for the specific poison in the first aid prescription.
The term "buck" is used by entomologists as a formal term for this group of insects.
The word case is related to the old words for bedbugs, which adapted to be parasites that live on humans.
Both insects and moths are nesting, adapting to live in the nest or in the housing of their host.
The estimated 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) throughout the United States, making it the leading neurodegenerative disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that multiple sclerosis is twice as common in women as in men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of the child.
These couples choose the plans to adopt their child.
In adoption, the birth parents waive their parental rights so that another couple can become the parents of the child.
The main goal of science is to scientifically discover how the world works, and this system actually drives a lot of scientific research.
It's not just experimentation, and a test is a test that is used to reject one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and make inferences to guide further scientific experiments.
Naturalists and philosophers paid close attention to classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views are accepted in scientific disciplines, including psychology.
As knowledge of the Greek language declines, the West feels cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
The rhythms in physiology and behavior are largely determined by biological clocks, mainly by the presence and production of endogenous cycles.
Thyroid markets, which are not normal responses to external time signals, have been documented in a variety of organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-propelled permanent oscillators that can continue to move smoothly even without external cues.
The Hershey and Chase test is one of the most important suggestions that DNA is genetic material.
Harsh and Chase used worms or viruses to insert their DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments, either with phosphorus to irradiate the DNA in the food or with sulfur to irradiate the protein in the food.
The effects of sudden mutation can vary greatly depending on the sudden mutation, the significance of the halved genetic material, and whether the atoms have affected the sequence of the atoms.
Only changes in germ-sequence cells can be passed on to children, whereas changes elsewhere can cause cell-death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism is a popular attraction for people who visit natural sites to enjoy the spectacles including flora and fauna.
Hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and reading information about the environment are examples of on-site activities.

Everyday morning, people drive from small towns to their workplace, so they pass the others who work where they go.

science now suggests that this giant carbon economy has taken the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.

You know, in developed countries, there are similar complaints about water quality or about collapsing bridges.
Why are transport systems causing such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers just incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Vehicle congestion is the study of the movement and interaction of vehicles and individual drivers between two points.
Unfortunately, it is a bit difficult to study traffic because it is impossible to predict the behaviour of drivers with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to drive vehicles within a reasonable range of balance, so that traffic has a reasonable stability and is mathematically represented.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between three key attributes: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These links help in planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly allows them to easily escape from enemies and to efficiently locate food and allies.
Most insect species have the ability to fold their wings back into their bodies.
This provides them with a wide range of small hiding places to escape from the ferocious animals.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are the dimped-tautons and the mayflies.
1000 years ago, Aristarchus said that the solar ocean revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, others thought he was wrong, that the solar system, including the sun, revolves around the earth (and the other stars as well).
It seems reasonable, because it doesn't feel like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, with water levels eight times higher than the second largest.
The Amazon River is the widest river on Earth, at six miles wide.
20% of the ocean's water from these rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.

The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed to see the monuments built by their ancestors, which were over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800, making it the smallest independent state in the world.
Vatican City uses Italian in its law and official communications.

Vatican City is a city of Roman Catholics.

Aristotelis, the philosopher, said that everything is made up of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
He also thought that there were four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, but they all evolved into new substances, creating what we see.
Alloys are basically a combination of two (2) or more metals.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You can also get alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements like carbon.
everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly small that at the end of this line, there's a trillion of them.

It is regrettable that pencil has been given a lower status and uses as new writing systems have emerged.
People are now writing messages on computer screens, they are not going to get near pencil pens to write.
When something new comes along, you can wonder what magic the keyboard can do.
Fusion bond works on the principle of using energy to bind a nucleus with multiple protons and neutrons together.
To release some of that energy by splitting the embryo again is like rolling a heavy cart up a hill.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they can split with little or no fission.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The top is about 70 km thick inside and 100 km thick outside.
It is thin beneath the substantial dark patch on the lunar surface and thick beneath the plateaus.
Because the top tile was thin, there might be more maria on the near side. It was easy to climb up to the surface of the volcano.
Content theory revolves around what people like or what people choose.
These theories suggest that people have specific needs and/or preferences that are inherent in them as they become adults.
Theories are about looking at people and making them do the things they like and exploring what their environment makes them do and what it doesn't.
Two well-known content theories are Maslow's order-demand theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
"Generally speaking, there are two types of behaviour that can occur when managers lead their former peers. The one (1) node of the spectrum is ""being one of the others""".
Managers like this have difficulty making tough decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities and holding them accountable for their actions.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person becomes an unidentified person, who thinks he or she has to change everything the group has done and create as they wish.
After all, the leader is responsible for the team's success or failure.
This behavior often causes division between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are just as good as regular teams, but with some subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as liaison and assistants to the next group of people.
They often have more autonomy than regular teams, because their teams can be in different time zones, which may not be understood by local authorities.

"The Secret Team" is the executive team, all members report to them their status."The Secret Team" will grade each member."
Why would a company want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning company? The only goal for implementing the ideas of learning companies is to use innovation.
