Members of the Welsh Assembly have expressed concern about being treated as puppets.
Some Assembly members have expressed displeasure after hearing a suggestion to change their office name to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The idea was born after plans were developed to rename the Welsh Assembly.
Members of the political board are worried that this plan is a good way to make fun of them.
A Labour Party member at the convention commented that  in English, which rhymes with Twp and Pwp, is the new name.
If you're from outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means inozoa and pwp means kaka.
A member of the Scottish parliament said the whole group was "not very happy" and suggested that alternative names be sought.
A member of the Conservative Party in Wales has also said that he is "open" to new ideas for a name change, but has also expressed his concerns about the rhymes that MWP changes may bring.
To better understand this conflict, it is important to note that the Welsh w and the English u of Yorkshire have a similar pronunciation.
The assembly commission, which is working on a legal draft for the name changes, has stated the following: As for the members of the assembly, they will have sole responsibility for choosing the descriptors they wish to use.
Under the Government of Wales Act 2017, the Assembly of Wales has the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation to select the proposed proposals and in general the name of the Welsh Parliament received numerous expressions of solidarity.
As regards the names of the members of the Assembly, the Commission chose the name Members of the Legislative Assembly for Wales or WMP (in English acronyms), but the name MWP was decided upon in a public consultation.
Members of the Assembly, however, suggest alternatives, but it can be extremely difficult to unanimously choose an option; especially for Assembly presidents, Elin Jones, who has had to send a draft with changes in a matter of weeks.
However, the legislation of the changes that will be made will affect the functioning of the assembly; among other things, rules will be created to prevent activities that would cause the members of the assembly to lose their good name and the design of the assembly system will be managed with the help of this law.
When discussing a change in legislation, the members of the Assembly will have the opportunity to finally decide on their own behalf.
Macedonians are going to hold a referendum to change the name of their country.
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum was organized to try to resolve the decades-long dispute with Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
The Athenian government has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to its territory and has repeatedly blocked its bid to join the European Union and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who is opposed to the referendum on changing the name, said he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum (including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev) say it is simply the price to pay for joining the UK and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's lose their resonance in the face of the harlem churches' problems.
"I've spoken to a number of elderly people and they say that in the past, you could find a bar and a church on every corner", Mr. Adams says.
Today, there is nothing left.
She says it's okay to disappear from bars.
People use other methods to socialize, he explains.
Bars are not the neighborhood living rooms people used to meet in.
As for the church, it's worried that the money raised from the sale of assets won't be enough and that sooner or later we'll be back to square one.
And churches can be replaced with housing and housing estates filled with people who don't care about their local shrines.
"The people who buy the communal housing will be white people", he says, "and that's why churches will be closing in a hurry because these new people are not members of church congregations".
Both churches were built by congregations of white people before Harlem became a black metropolis; it was the Metropolitan community of 1870 and St. Martin's was built a decade later.
The original Methodist congregation moved out of the neighborhood in 1930.
After that, a small group of black people took over.
The black congregation of Reverend John Howard Johnson took over St. Martin's Church; Howard organized a boycott against shops on 125th Street in Harlem that did not hire or promote black people.
The church suffered considerable damage in a fire in 1939, but the parishioners of Father Johnson designed several plans to rebuild the church and commissioned the assembly of the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to the St. Martin's, named the carillon the "Bell of the Poor People".
In July, the expert who played the carillon gave it another name: Treasure of Culture and irreplaceable historical instrument.
The expert, Tiffany Nek of the University of Michigan, also said that it was the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, the musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had moved to play a larger carillon in the Riverside church 18 years earlier.
Mr. Merriweather explains that St. Martin's did not replace his musician.
In recent months, San Martín has seen the tiresome exodus of several architects and contractors, some of them brought in by lay leaders or the bishopric.
The parish assemblies (the artistic council composed of lay leaders), on the other hand, sent a letter to the diocese in July to verify that the costs incurred by the hiring of these persons would pass to the parish, as the parish has no involvement in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Several parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency in the diocese.
A 13-year-old boy is injured by a shark while hunting oysters in the California Strait.
According to the police, a 13-year-old boy was severely injured by a shark on Saturday while he was hunting oysters off the California coast on the first day of oyster season.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. on Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was swimming with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard his friend screaming for help, and then he and a group of people swam to his friend to help him out of the water.
Hammel, who thought his friend was screaming for joy at having found an oyster, first realized that his friend was screaming "I've been bitten!"
I was bitten!
"I could see his entire clavicle", said Hammel, after he saw his friend.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water, there's a shark!" explained Hammel.
The boy was taken to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, and his condition is critical.
We couldn't detect the species of shark that attacked.
Captain Larry Giles, a fellow rescuer, has issued a press release stating that a shark was spotted a few weeks earlier, but the species was generally deemed not to be a threat.
Giles also testified that the victim's wounds were on the upper part of the dress.
The police have closed all roads from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami Beach in Encinitas for a 48-hour investigation and to ensure the safety of the public.
Giles explained that there are over 135 species of sharks in the reef, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's supermarket plans to enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's has taken over the Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams stores and now offers department stores style beauty services with a diverse and skilled staff.
While sales of fashion and home products continue to shrink, £2.8 billion has been invested in the UK beauty sector, which is growing indefinitely; larger beauty departments will be built and tested in 11 stores across the country. If the results are good, more stores will open next year.
Thanks to investments in the beauty sector, the departments that used to sell TVs, microwaves and household products can now benefit supermarkets.
According to Sainsbury's supermarkets, their beauty product offerings will double to more than 3,000 products; it will also put Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw and similar brands at the disposal of customers.
As for the L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees brands, they will have more space in the branded areas, like the areas that can be found in Boots stores.
In addition, the supermarket reintroduces its Boutique brand make-up, which is a purely vegan product; younger shoppers are increasingly demanding such products.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test the deals offered by the perfume retailer in two Sainsbury's supermarket stores; the first opened last week in Croydon, south London and the second, in Selly Oaken, Birmingham, will open later this year.
Because of online shopping and the trend of buying groceries every day in small local stores, supermarkets have to work their heads and ears to attract new customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's supermarkets, said that retail outlets will adopt the style of department stores and the supermarket chain will reduce the threat of competitors Aldi and Lidl by offering more products other than services and food.
Supermarket chain Sainsbury's has opened Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and opened several Habitats, following the purchase of both chains two years ago; as a result, grocery sales have strengthened and the purchased chains are more profitable than ever.
The supermarket tried to reopen the beauty and pharmaceutical section, but the strategy failed.
It then merged with Sainsbury's Boots in the early 2000s, but that partnership ended as the process of dividing the profits made in the supermarket pharmacy departments became burnt paper.
A new strategy was set in motion when Sainsbury's supermarket sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, who owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
The Lloyds chain will have a role in the planned plan: it will add a large range of luxury skin care brands to its four stores; among them La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, chief commercial officer of Sainsbury's supermarkets, said: "We have improved the look of our beauty departments so that our customers can find the perfect environments.
We've also hired highly experienced personnel to advise us on the details of the products.
We have designed our brand range to meet all your requirements and, thanks to our comfortable environments and locations, our beauty departments offer a modern and easy alternative to stores that use outdated methods.
Peter Jones is "angry" after Holly Willoughby turned down an offer of 11 million pounds.
The star of Dragons Den Peter Jones has left the show "angry" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby cancelled an offer of £11 million linked to the permanent brand deal as he wants to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly, which is a brand of household goods and ingredients.
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning announced her resignation on Instagram.
Following Holly Willoughby's resignation to accept contracts offered by Marks & Spencer and ITV, the star of Dragons' Den Peter Jones was furious that he had left the lucrative business they had formed at the last minute.
According to our sources, a tense meeting was held at the Marlow headquarters on Tuesday and as a result, Jones was "extremely angry" when he heard the statement from our most famous TV lady that she was accepting new contracts worth £1.5 million and therefore would not be able to devote more time to Truly brand household products and accessories.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and has doubled Willoughby's £11 million fortune.
After Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he was leaving the Truly brand business, Jones left the UK to move to a holiday home.
A source told the Associated Press that this option has always been one of Holly's top priorities.
A decision that will guarantee him the next two decades of his future.
But his decision to leave his mark has left us stunned.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, just as the brand's bidding was about to close.
"In fact, the warehouse at the Marlow Home is now full of merchandise for sale".
According to experts, the company is on the verge of losing millions of pounds due to the departure of the presenter of This Morning (who is the most profitable presenter in the UK); the company has invested a lot of money in various products (including pillows, candles, clothing and household goods) and now has to deal with any delays that may arise.
Besides, the fact that you're not going to be able to talk to her about it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have three children and Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, have been close friends for ten years.
Willoughby and Capp founded Truly in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as CEO in March.
Both couples always plan their vacations together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source in Jones's team said last night that Jones would not comment on his business activities.
It was a tough conversation, yes, but then we fell in love.
He was joking about the bad press he was getting from the media, all for making an "inappropriate" comment about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given so much?
Trump used his "TV host" voice to respond to the jokes:
I don't give anything away.
After his first summit in Singapore in June, Kim announced his desire to hold a second summit with President Trump, which was an incredibly important step toward North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
However, the process of nuclear disarmament has stalled.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN: "At the General Assembly on Saturday, North Korea has not seen an 'adequate response' from the United States to the country's steps towards denuclearization".
Instead, the United States has tightened its sanctions to keep up the pressure.
Trump, on the other hand, is more optimistic, which he made clear in his recent speech.
"Our relations with North Korea are better than ever", he said.
Besides, we were about to declare war on North Korea.
This war could cost millions of lives.
But now we have this extraordinary relationship".
He further said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded good results; among other things, missile tests have been completed, hostage release processes have been improved and the withdrawal of the rest of the US military is underway.
It also explains his unusual perspective on his conversations with Kim.
"It's an incredibly easy job for the president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to break into the country, we have 200 people here", said Trump as he pointed to the crowd.
Tsunami and earthquake devastate an island in Indonesia, killing hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, the need for international non-profit organizations was eliminated.
Although 10 percent of Lombok's population was displaced, the earthquake was not declared a national disaster (a precondition for requesting international assistance).
"In many cases, unfortunately, the government made it very clear that it did not need international assistance, so this situation is a challenge", says Ms. Sumbung.
Save the Children is putting together a team to go to Palú, but they don't know if the volunteers are allowed to work in the country yet.
Mr. Sutopo, representative of the National Disaster Management Agency, told us that Indonesian officials are working with Pyongyang to prepare the international aid agencies to accept the request.
Although Indonesia has been hit by several earthquakes, the country has taken some very strict measures to manage the natural disaster.
Tsunami-proof fortifications have been built in Aceh, but there are still too few fortifications on the coast.
Palu doesn't have a siren to warn people. So the siren is on, which may explain the death toll.
When the weather is nice, traveling between the Indonesian islands can be a challenge.
Even more, natural disasters make it difficult to implement logistics efforts.
A hospital ship to deliver treatment to the victims of the earthquake was anchored in Lombok and is now heading to Palua; however, it will take at least three days to reach the disaster site.
President Joko Widodo's campaign focused on projects to improve Indonesia's infrastructure and has invested a lot of money in improving roads and railways.
However, the funding has been cut and President Joko's administration is in a tight spot as it prepares for next year's general election.
Mr. Joko also has trouble controlling sectarian tensions in Indonesia; for example, most members of the Islamic Party have taken a more conservative view of religion.
As a result, more than 1,000 people have died and tens of thousands have been displaced as Christian and Islamic gangs take to the streets to fight with machetes, bows, arrows, and other weapons.
Watch the draw between Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge and Chelsea.
A goal from Daniel Sturridge in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge on Saturday saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea.
A 30-yard pass from Xherdan Shaqiri to Chealsey gave Sturridge the chance to change the score to 1-0.
Before he kicked the ball into the goalpost, he put it to his left.
That kick made the ball fly straight into the sand and into the top right of the net.
The ball finally passed the guard of Kepa Arrizabalaga and entered the net.
"Since players like Shaq always play on the top, I wanted to get that position to get the ball, so I tried to get enough time", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw the song coming, and with one touch, the ball was in my feet, and after that I didn't have much time to think: I just took the chance".
The match was halfway through as Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute to lead Chelsea 1-0.
In this move, the blue forward returned a heel pass to Mateo Kovacic, who turned around in the middle of the field and ran into Liverpool's centre.
Kovacic was wailing in the middle of the field.
Then he hit the ball hard, right down to Hazard's foot in the sand.
Hazard overtook the opposing defense and hit the net from the goal post with a left footed punch that destroyed Liverpool's Alisson Becker's defense.
Liverpool's next match is against Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 15:00 on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 15:00 on Tuesday afternoon in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832.
According to the National Disaster Management Agency on Sunday, the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
According to a press conference by the representative Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, after the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday, several people were trapped in the rubble.
The city of Palu, with over 380,000 inhabitants, was left in ruins.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man for stabbing and killing a woman.
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead this morning.
The body of the 44-year-old woman was found with stab wounds at 7.55am in Grayson Mew, John Street, and a 32-year-old man has been arrested as the main suspect in the murder.
Police are asking people in the area if they've seen or heard anything that's disturbing the area to call the police.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said the investigation is just beginning, but if anyone has seen or heard anything on John Street in Birkenhead, we'd like you to contact us.
We are also asking for the help of drivers of cars that may be recording, including other taxi drivers, because they may have recorded information that is vital to the investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman found was a resident of Birkenhead and her body was found inside a house.
That afternoon, several friends who knew the woman arrived at the scene to find out where the body, which was found in the morning, was.
As the investigation progresses, the police will be in contact with the victim's family.
A taxi driver from Grayson Mews tried to break into his apartment, but police say no one is allowed in or out of the building today.
When she heard what had happened, she was shocked.
The residents will have to wait a few hours for their own homes.
A police officer was talking to a neighbor who was indicating that the entire area would be considered a crime scene.
Later, a woman came to the scene crying.
She kept saying, "This is scary".
At 2:00 p.m., two police cars entered the police line and another patrol car was left outside.
Several officers searched the apartment building.
Anyone with information can send a message to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously call Crimestoppers (0800 555 111) simply by mentioning the 247th recording of September 30th.
The Cromwell statue in Parliament becomes the ultimate target of the "rewrite history" trend.
If it disappears, it will be poetic justice: just as the Taliban destroyed many religious sites, the fanatical Puritans in England did so to many historical and cultural sites across the country.
The Cromwell Society, however, considers Mr. Crick's suggestion to be "a nonsense" and that he is "trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, the representative of the Cromwell Society, said the following: "The dispute over the removal of the statues of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Palace is inevitable; Cromwell has become an objective.
Cromwell himself never ordered or organized such iconoclasms of the English Civil War.
Perhaps it is time to sacrifice another Cromwell for the deeds of his great-grandfather, Thomas, in the last century.
The striking depiction of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is part of 19th century opinions and our historiography; many people still feel that the deeds of this person should be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Fewer people think this than in the 19th century, yes, but still many people think Cromwell was a defender of parliament against outside pressures; in this case, of course, we are talking about the monarchy.
Whether or not she was an accurate representation of this person remains a subject of historical debate.
However, we can safely say that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century was the starting point of our country's development, and the illustrious Cromwell was part of the parties that participated in that starting point.
"Lord Protector" may also be a reason to celebrate and remember all the achievements he has earned under the title".
A pig is killed by a Chinese farmer.
A farmer was killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, local media reports.
A man named "Yuan" was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood in a pigsty in the Liupanshu market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The animals are not the only ones who are affected by the disease.
Usually on Wednesdays, she travels with her cousin from Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found the body and saw that the door to the adjacent pigsty was open.
He also mentioned that there was a big pig in the pigsty with blood in his mouth.
The forensic report confirms that the 550-pound pig killed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were covered in blood and bruised", said the cousin, whose last name is Wu, in the Guiyang Evening News.
According to the surveillance video, Yuan can be seen entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not of Yuan's or his cousin's bloodline.
According to a market manager who told the Evening News, the pig is locked up to prevent further attacks and to allow the police to collect evidence.
Yuan's family and market leaders are negotiating a compensation for her death.
Although rare, there have been reports of pig attacks in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man severely injured.
Ten years earlier, a £650 pig had surrounded a Welsh farmer with his tractor, trying to scare the man's wife away.
In 2012, a farmer in Oregon was eaten by pigs, and after that, a farmer in Manitoba claimed on CBC News that pigs are not aggressive animals, but if they taste blood, it could act as a vector.
"They love to play games.
They're like children, very curious and they don't want to hurt you.
"You just have to show some respect", she said.
Small-scale storms from Hurricane Rosa will leave heavy rainfall over the southwest United States.
According to the weather service, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves into the colder waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa is expected to bring heavy rainfall to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
At 5:00 a.m., Rosa will develop into a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 85 miles per hour, and was detected Sunday at 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
By the way, Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low pressure area is forming over the Pacific Ocean and will move eastward toward the west coast of the United States.
In addition, Rosa is forecasting 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
After that, the tropical humidity will combine with the low pressure point, leading to heavy rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
In local areas, water depths of one to four inches can be dangerous because of sudden floods, debris flows, and landslides in the desert.
Heavy rainfall from tropical moisture can leave 2-3 inches of water per hour and in specific locations; especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
The southwest is expected to see two to four inches of rainfall, mostly in Arizona.
Because tropical rains are nomadic, they can cause flash floods and degraded wetlands.
It is highly advisable not to go for a walk in the desert when there is a tropical storm warning.
Heavy downpours can turn canyons into torrential streams and storms can bring up stormy winds and dust.
Also, as the pressure drops, we're expecting some rainfall along the southern California coast.
Rain can collect up to a half inch of water, and it can create small sewage streams and slippery roads.
This may be the first rain in the Shire's rainy season.
There is also a slight chance of tropical rain in Arizona on Sunday and Monday, but more heavy rain is expected on Monday and Tuesday.
On Tuesday, heavy rainfall will spread to the four corners of the country and will continue until Wednesday.
October may see sharp temperature swings in the United States as the Arctic regions cool, but temperatures in the tropics will remain mild.
Sometimes these temperatures fluctuate dramatically over short distances.
Just to give you an example, we're expecting some very sharp temperature swings in the central United States on Sunday.
There's a difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
The summer heat will be here in the next few days and it will spread to all corners of the globe.
Central and eastern United States will see a warm October with temperatures reaching 80 degrees from the southern plains to the northeast.
Also, it's going to be 80 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, roughly 10 degrees above the average.
The Long-Term Weather Service forecasts that the eastern United States will experience above-average temperatures during the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have seen the statement by Brett Kavanaugh.
More than 20 million people watched Channel Six news Tuesday's stunning statements by Supreme Court nominees Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who sued Kavanaugh for sexual abuse in 1980.
Meanwhile, political unrest continued and the network's anchors interrupted their regular Friday programming to report a last-minute news story that Arizona Senator Jeff Flake had reached an agreement with the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation.
Based on Ford's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, he is absolutely certain that Kavanaugh touched her repeatedly while drunk and tried to strip her naked at a high school party.
In a statement, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely convinced that this never happened.
According to Nielsen data, approximately 20.4 million people saw the statement on Friday.
The company calculated the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
However, this amount was not immediately available to other channels that issued the declaration; including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen has a problem with counting the number of people watching TV in their offices.
For example, we could say that the number of viewers is comparable to a football final or the Academy Awards.
As for Fox News Channel, Kavanaugh's statement is considered fully acceptable by the channel's presenters and was watched by an average of 5.69 million viewers while he was making the statement, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had $3.1 million, NBC had $2.94 million, MSNBC had $2.89 million and CNN had $2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
After the statement, the public's interest remained.
Flake was the heart of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican Party office announced that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CCTV footage from CNN and CBS captured Kavanaugh surrounded by protesters on Friday as he tried to grab an elevator to testify before the Magistrate's Court.
It was seen live on CNN with his eyes down as the protesters rioted.
"I'm here, in front of you", said a woman.
Do you really think he's telling the truth?
And he added, "You have incredible potential, but not many women have it".
At that point, and before the elevator doors closed, Flake said his office had issued a statement and would provide more details during the board meeting.
The show was being broadcast live every hour by cable and cable TV stations while the Magistrates' Assembly was voting on Kavanaugh's nomination for senator.
However, Flake said he would vote on the bill after a week-long review of the FBI's arguments against the candidate, which the Democratic minority was demanding.
After talking to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, Flake became almost confident in the investigation.
After talking to Coons and a few senators, Flake made his final decision.
Flake's decision was powerful because the Republican Party doesn't have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without a full poll.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" on Brexit as a basis.
According to an interview in the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accuses those who criticize her plans to leave the European Union of playing with the future of the UK and undermining the country's interests.
29 September 2018, Britain, British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at a Conservative Party speech in Birmingham.
In another interview that appeared on the front page of the paper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson criticized the so-called "Lady Game" plan for Brexit and said the taxes Britain and the European Union had to pay were "totally ridiculous".
Wayde Sims shot and killed, police arrest Dyteon Simpson for the murder of LSU football player
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the death of Wayde Simsen, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and sent to prison today for a single count of second-degree murder, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Police released a video of Sims and Simpson arguing and the police say that Sims lost his glasses in the fight.
CBS affiliate WAFB said that the police recovered those glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them.
When Simpson was questioned, he confessed to shooting Wayde.
His bail was set at $350,000, his lawyer said.
The East Baton Rouge District Court released a preliminary report Friday that stated the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department would like to thank the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Unit, the State Police Criminology Laboratory, the Southern University Police Department and the local community for their help in the search for the suspect.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Alleva thanked the police for their "conspicuous diligence and continued support of the law".
Sims was 20.
The 6-foot-2 center grew up in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where his father also played basketball at Wayne State University.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shaken and devastated" by Wayden's death.
"These are the things that always worry you", said Wade.
A volcano is spewing ash over Mexico City.
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico City.
The National Disaster Prevention Center issued a warning to Mexicans on Saturday and recommended that they stay away from the volcano after detecting several activity spots in the crater; 183 gas and ash spills were recorded over 24 hours.
The volcano's half also experienced several tremors.
According to images on social media, thin layers of ash can be seen on the windshields of some neighborhoods of Mexico City (e.g. Xochimilco).
Geophysicists have detected an increase in activity at the volcano, located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Fighting between police and Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday over clashes between pro-independence protesters and riot police as thousands of people joined the protests to mark the first anniversary of the Catalan independence vote.
A disguised separatist group was stopped by riot police, but they threw eggs and paint dust at them, which caused dust clouds to form in the crowded streets.
More fighting broke out later because the police were using their batons to stop the riots.
Also, pro-independence groups marched for several hours chanting "We will not forget, we will not forgive" in front of the unionists who were chanting "Long live Spain".
According to local media, 14 people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the clashes.
There is a lot of tension in this territory that is trying to find independence after the elections that were held on October 1st, which were illegal according to the government in Madrid, but the separatists in Catalonia managed to get a day to celebrate.
The majority of voters voted for independence, but the public participation was very low due to the number of anti-independence citizens who wanted to boycott the election.
According to the Catalan authorities, 1,000 people were injured after the police attack, in which the polling stations were approached to stop voters, leading to violent riots.
Pro-independence groups camped out on Friday to avoid a pro-police march.
There was a march, but they were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician, went with his wife to the independence march, saying that he no longer had any hope of Catalonia achieving independence.
We had a wonderful time together last year.
My parents cried tears of joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck", he said.
After a small but important victory in the local elections last December, the pro-independence Catalan parties have had many problems this year to maintain public interest; several party leaders are in exile or have been arrested and are now awaiting trial for organizing the referendum and declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, is recording a pro-police march on his phone and blames politicians from both parties for the situation.
"Then it gets more and more tense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the leaders of Catalonia, who has been in prison since last year awaiting trial, said he would participate in the European Parliament elections scheduled for next year.
"If I run as a candidate in the European elections, it will be the best way to protest against the degradation of democratic values and the repression of the Spanish government", he said.
Londonderry: three men arrested for hitting a house with a car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested for driving into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent at approximately 19:30 (BST) on Tuesday afternoon.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the building and its doors were damaged.
Also, it looks like a crossbow was used on the car.
Menda's throw gives Livingston a 1-0 lead over the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal confirms Livingston's high.
The promoted Livingston has impressed Rangers fans as Steven Gerrard scores his second defeat in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's throw was a decisive one as Gary Holten's Hibernian team advanced in the second half.
Gerrard's side remain unbeaten in the Premiership this season and will have to play the leaders Hearts (who have eight points more) on Sunday.
Before that game, the Rangers will play Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, Livingston's team is undefeated with six games left in the season, and Coach Holt doesn't know what failure means since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses a few chances to the strong visitors.
Holt's team needed to take the lead before scoring a goal, and his tremendous accuracy caused Rangers several problems.
Scott Robinson made his way through but all his efforts were lost in front of the door and then Alan Lithgow redirected his efforts to the door after Craig Halkett's head injury.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play, but they knew the visitors could come and get them.
And with that spirit came the decisive goal.
The Rangers gave up a free throw and Livingston created an opening; Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined to score Menga, but the latter scored a goal in the middle of the goal if he touched the ball.
At this stage of the game the Rangers dominated the offense, but the home defense was impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly passed the game without a problem.
This pattern continued until the middle of the second half, but the throw of Alfredo Morelos required Kelly's full skill.
Scott Pittman was unable to score against Rangers for goalie Allan McGregor and Lithgow avoided Livingston's second play.
Passes were repeatedly entered into Livingston's sand and repeatedly removed by home players; two penalties were requested, one for Halkett challenging rep Glenn Middleton and the other for touching the ball with his hand, but both were dismissed.
Livingston's game is a shock.
Alasdair Lamont from the BBC Scotland, Tony Macaroni at the Macaroni Arena
Livingston's game was a great one and a perfect result.
They've been doing some amazing things for me and they have incredible chances of promotion.
The style of play and the team's style has hardly changed since they arrived in the top division, but Holt has been an extraordinary coach: he has put the team on the right track since his arrival.
He had heroes.
Captain Halkett's work has been incredible, with his unmatched defensive coordination and management, and Menga has been responsible for keeping Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall nervous throughout the game.
I guess the Rangers didn't have much inspiration.
They work great under Gerrard, but they've forgotten the standards their coach set for them.
The last move was a weak one and they beat the home defense only once, so the Rangers need to move fast if they want to get out of the middle of the board.
Erdogan is met with a hostile reception in Cologne.
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was designed to improve relations between NATO allies.
They discussed a range of issues including the lack of human rights and press freedom and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city has the largest population in Turkey outside Turkey.
Due to the police's strict security measures, 25,000 people were blocked from gathering outside the mosque, but several supporters gathered around to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters (mostly Kurds) joined their voices to protest against Erdogan's political measures and the German government's decision to welcome the president.
The protesters on both sides were reflecting the disagreements that the president had stirred up, some Turks in Germany calling him a hero and others calling him just an autocrat.
A cyclist has died in a collision with a car.
A cyclist has died in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred at the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets at approximately 10:15 a.m. on a road in Deptford, a city in the southeast of the city that is usually congested with cars.
The driver stopped and the ambulance arrived immediately, but the man died on the spot.
In Childers Street, a mile from the accident on Saturday, another cyclist was killed about a month ago and the driver fled the scene.
The Metropolitan Police are working to identify the man and alert his family.
Some roads have been closed and bus lines have been re-routed; motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Six officers injured in a brawl in Long Lartin Prison.
Six prison guards were injured during a brawl at the maximum security men's prison, the prison office said.
The riot at the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire began at 09:30 on Sunday morning and continues to rage.
Tornado specialists have arrived at the prison to put an end to the violence initiated by eight detainees, which is currently confined to one wing of the building.
All three officers had minor facial injuries that were treated on the spot.
A representative of the prison service said the following: "Expert prison staff have been sent to put an end to the riots at HMP Long Lartin".
Six workers were treated for their injuries.
We will not tolerate any kind of violence in our prisons, and the instigators of the riots will be handed over to the police and will likely spend a lot longer behind bars.
The HMP Long Lartin Correctional Facility houses over 500 inmates, including some of the most violent criminals in the state.
In June, the warden of the prison was hospitalized after an inmate attacked him.
In addition, in October last year, riot police officers had to go to prison to stop a major riot, where the inmates were attacking workers with pool sticks.
Hurricane Rosa has become a threat to Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flash flooding (the drier areas may benefit)
It's very rare to see a tropical storm in Arizona, but it's expected to happen next week as Hurricane Rosa reaches its peak, hitting the desert of the southwest with the threat of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning of sudden flooding expected Monday and Friday; the hurricane will enter western Arizona and move south and east into Nevada, as well as through southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa will fly directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, but the heavy rains on Monday will signal her arrival.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted the following: Since 1950, ten tropical cyclones formed within 200 miles of Phoenix have maintained their tropical storm or depression status.
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the border of AZ".
The latest forecast from the National Hurricane Center is for a two to four-inch drop in the Atlantic Ocean, with a maximum of six inches of rainfall near the Mogollon Ridge in Arizona.
As for other areas in the southwest of the desert (including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin), 1-2 inches of water will collect; in isolated areas, a maximum of 4 inches will collect.
For those who expect flash floods, the Rose Rain may be a blessing, after the recent droughts in the region.
Floods should not be underestimated, but these torrential downpours could be beneficial to the drought the Southwest is currently experiencing.
According to the U.S. Dry Control Service, 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing severe drought, which is the second highest category, according to weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa will pass through the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa will remain strong Sunday morning with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and a maximum sustained wind speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, which is causing it to weaken in strength.
It's expected to reach Mexico as a tropical storm Monday afternoon or night.
Due to the possibility of severe storms in some parts of Mexico, there is a high risk of flooding.
According to weather.com, "rainfall is expected to leave 3-6 inches of water from Baja California to Sonora in the southwest, with possible 10 inches of rainfall in some areas".
Rosa will then pass through northern Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression; it will then pass through Arizona and head south into Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main threat to Rose or its storms are severe thunderstorms in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the desert of the southwestern United States", said the National Hurricane Center.
These rains will cause sudden floods and dangerous debris flows in the deserts and landslides in the mountains.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder.
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was shot in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4:00 a.m.
He was taken to hospital and his condition is stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested later that night in the Radstock area of Avon and Somerset, police said.
If anyone has any recordings or any idea what happened with that phone, my fellow cops want your help.
Trump says Kavanaugh is facing "the senseless wrath of the Democratic Party".
"Your vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a clear rejection of the Democratic Party's ruthless and outrageous tactics", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump also said that Kavanaugh had to endure "the absurdity and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
On Tuesday, Kavanaugh testified before Congress, completely refuting the allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford, who claimed that Kavanaugh raped her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified after hearing her case.
The president said on Saturday, "The people of the United States gave testimony that day to Kavanaugh's courage, intelligence and quality.
"The votes for Judge Kavanaugh confirm that he is one of the finest legal minds of our time, a lawyer who has dedicated his life to protecting public service", the president told supporters in West Virginia.
Not only did the president speak out about Kavanaugh's nomination, but he also spoke out about the importance of the Republican Party in this election.
"Five weeks to go to vote in the most important election of our lives.
I won't participate, but I will campaign".
"That's why I'm here, to fight on the side of the best candidates".
Trump also said that the Democratic Party is using strategies to hinder and complicate the campaign.
A senior Republican official told CNN that the Senate is expected to vote on Kavanaugh's nomination by Friday.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, death toll still rising
Authorities said on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed in a series of earthquakes and tsunamis that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, most of them while huge waves washed up on the beaches.
Hundreds of people gathered in the city of Palu on Friday to celebrate a festival, but by evening waves of six meters (18 feet) had ravaged the coast; several people were dragged to their deaths and everything in their path was destroyed.
The tsunami was caused by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"A tsunami warning was issued yesterday, but people were still on the beach doing various activities and did not immediately evacuate, so they became victims", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a representative of the Indonesian Disaster Prevention Agency (BNPB) said in an interview in Jakarta.
"The tsunami swept away cars, logs and houses and destroyed everything in the territory", says Nugroho; in fact, the tsunami traveled over open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before reaching the coast.
"Many people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived", the delegate said.
Approximately 16,700 people attended the 24 centers in Palo.
Several destroyed buildings and shops, a destroyed bridge, and a flooded mosque can be seen on aerial photographs taken by the Disaster Management Agency.
Aftershocks continued to hit the coast on Saturday.
The earthquakes were felt in a territory of 2.4 million people.
According to a report published by the Indonesian Technology Evaluation and Application Agency (BPPT), the energy level released by Friday's major earthquake was 200 times more powerful than the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is located in a long, narrow bay, may have had something to do with the magnitude of the tsunami, the agency said.
According to Nugroho, the disaster was "extremely devastating", with thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels destroyed.
The bodies of several victims were found in the rubble of the destroyed buildings, resulting in 540 more injuries and 29 missing persons.
Nugroho also said that the number of victims and the disaster could increase along the 300-kilometer (190-mile) coastline of Palu; specifically a place called Donggala, which is near the epicenter.
"The media in Donggala is not functioning and we have no information", Nugroho said.
According to the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people are in the area, and the organization's staff and volunteers are currently on the move to the affected areas to provide assistance.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could be much worse", he said.
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticized for not providing information about the tsunami that devastated Palu, but officials said the waves appeared after the warning was sent.
A video shared on social media shows a man standing in a building, shouting tsunami coming to warn people on the street.
A few minutes later, the water wall reaches the entire coast, dragging buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the recording.
Due to the tsunami caused by the earthquake, all the media in Palu were cut off, making it difficult for the competent authorities to organize rescue efforts.
According to officials, the military has sent aid from Jakarta and other major cities, but evacuees still need food and other supplies.
The city's airport has reopened to facilitate rescue efforts and will be closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation center in Palu on Sunday.
The tsunami in Indonesia has killed over 800 people.
It's a tragedy.
World Vision personnel from Donggala arrived safely in Palu city (where workers have set up wooden shelters in the courtyard of the organization's offices), but they have seen firsthand the horrific situation left behind by the disaster, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw so many houses destroyed", he said.
That's too bad.
Although relief groups began to repair the disaster relief work, some complained that experienced workers and helpers advised against going to Palura.
According to Indonesian law, international financing, supplies and personnel can only be started after the disaster zone is classified as a national disaster.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial-level disaster", says Aulia Arrianini, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, 'OK, this is a national disaster,' we can open our doors to international aid, which is not yet classified as such".
In the second night of the earthquake and tsunami in Pyongyang on Friday, the friends and families of those still missing had not lost hope in the unlikely miracle of their loved ones being found.
On Saturday, they pulled a little boy out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers pulled out a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days, with the body of her mother beside her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team trained two of the missing paragliders from the Asian Games, which ended this month in Indonesia.
The others trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were students.
"As an expert in the world of paragliding, I have my emotional load", he said.
Mr. Gendon explained that within hours of the news of the Roa Roa Hotel's collapse in the parapent community, he was sending WhatsApp messages to contestants who were at the beach party.
His messages, however, only got one gray arrow, not two blue marks.
"I guess that means those messages weren't sent", he added.
Thieves stole $26,750 while filling ATMs in Newport on the Levine.
Friday morning, robbers stole $26,750 from a worker filling an ATM in Newport on the Brink, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver was robbing the ATM of the entertainment complex and preparing to deliver extra cash, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
While she was working, another man "attacked the Brink's employee from behind and stole a bag of money from her that she was supposed to deliver.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, as stated in the statement, but police did not specify how many were involved in the incident.
If you have any information regarding their identities, please contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Rapper Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
He announced the change on Saturday on Twitter, "The being formerly known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been using the nickname Ye for some time, which he used as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
She made the change before appearing on Saturday Night Live, where Yandhi was expected to present her latest album.
She replaced Ariana Grande in the show, according to the show's creator, because she could not participate due to "emotional reasons".
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has indicated that the word also has a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible (in English) and it means 'zu in the Bible,'" West said recently, speaking about the album to the radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am we, we are we.
It's from Kanye, which means "to become Ye", becoming a reflection of our good, bad, confused, whole.
It's the best reflection of who we are".
He's one of the most famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs is also known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has indicated that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
Even West's old collaborator Jay-Z has changed the dashes and capital letters.
AMLO in Mexico has pledged not to use the military against the people.
The elected president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has vowed never to use armed force or the military against the population as the country marks the 50th anniversary of a bloody repression against students.
Lopez Obrador, on Saturday, swore in the Plaza Tlatelolco that he would "never use the military to repress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people, in a bid to stop the rise of leftist student violence throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help Mexicans study by giving them monthly scholarships and opening more free public colleges.
He says unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are what drive young people to join criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding of AA.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in this area, says investor and AI expert Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments arose when various parts of the US government made several statements about AA, although the US as a whole does not have an official AA strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year to become the leader in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the AI research would be a good start, as the other countries are far away from the U.S. and the AI is looking for the next breakthrough", Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the chances of major AI discoveries in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has researched one of China's leading AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that outperformed America's high-end Othello player and later held executive positions at Microsoft Research, and was president of Google in the China area.
Lee praised the U.S. government's previous technology competitions, including the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Competition, and asked when the next one would be, to help identify the next dreamers.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get government grants, says Lee.
"It's not that China is leading academic leaders, it's companies", Lee added.
Facebook, Google and a lot of other tech companies have been recruiting the brightest people from universities to join A.A. in the last few years.
Lee said that changing immigration policy would also help the U.S. encourage AI practices.
"I think that green cards should be automatically offered to AA doctors", he said.
In July 2017, China's State Council released the Development Plan for the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence.
The National Science Foundation of China, the National Science Foundation and other government agencies fund people in academic institutions the same way they do in the US, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee says.
Earlier that year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Center for Artificial Intelligence, which brought together partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And just this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI NEXT.
As for the NSF, it spends over $100 million a year on AI research.
Meanwhile, the proposed legislation in the UK to establish a National Security Committee on Artificial Intelligence has not made any progress in recent months.
Macedonians held a referendum to decide whether or not to change the name of their country.
The country of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday to change its name to the former Republic of Macedonia, ending a decades-long conflict that began when Greece blocked its membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which once had a province called Macedonia, still claims the name of its northern neighbors as its territory, and blocks its entry into NATO and the UK.
The governments of both countries reached an agreement in June based on a proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change is detrimental to the ethnic identity of most of Macedonia's Slavic citizens.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote in the referendum and his campaign boycott raised doubts about whether he would get the 50% of the vote needed to be valid.
This is the question that was on the referendum paper: "Are you in favor of NATO and UK membership with the Greek agreement?"
Those in favor of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is worthwhile to give Macedonia the opportunity to join EU and NATO institutions as one of the founding countries of the breakup of Yugoslavia.
"I am here to vote for the future of the country, for the future of young Macedonians, to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, which will bring us a safer life", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough members of Parliament have indicated they will follow the outcome of the vote to be decisive.
A name change would require a three-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said the state's emergency was not announced until 1 p.m.
However, only 16 percent of eligible voters have voted, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of eligible voters did.
"I went to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevsky, a 62-year-old voter from the capital Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in a Macedonian referendum for the country's name change and the possibility of joining NATO and the European Union, in Strumic, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and a staircase to the tents of those who wanted to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the UK, but we want to join on our terms, not through the door of the servers", Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can look to China or Russia and be part of the Euro-Asian integration".
Prime Minister Zaev says that a NATO member can bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is 20 percent.
"I think the majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of the citizens are for the UK and NATO", Zaev said after voting.
He said that saying yes would "confirm our future.
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research predicts that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the election - less than necessary.
Another poll, by the Macedonian Telma TV, showed that 57 percent of the residents were thinking about voting on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote for it.
For a successful referendum, we need 50% plus one vote in favour.
If the referendum fails, it would be the first major failure of pro-Western policy since it began in May last year.

Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton's entire defence in Saturday's 2-0 win over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero scored the goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine goalkeeper received a pass from the midfield early in the game.
He ran through three Brighton defenders before breaking into the open field.
Aguero suddenly found himself surrounded by four green T-shirts.
He pushed a defender after he escaped from several others on the sands of Brighton.
Then he made a pass to the left, and there was Sterling.
The English striker returned the ball to Aguero in the first touch, who used his right foot to overtake Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the net.
"Every day he overcomes a lot of problems with his foot", said City manager Pep Guardiola.
"We said he'd play 55 or 60 minutes.
And we did.
We were so happy that he scored in that moment".
But it was Sterling who gave the Blue Shirts a first-round lead in the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero caught the ball in Brighton's field.
He gave Leroy Sané a perfect pass from the left flank.
San made a few minor touches before he aimed Sterling at the far post.
The blue jersey guy just pushed the ball into the net before it went over the line.
City will play Hoffenheim in their Champions League final on Tuesday at 12:55pm at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to ruin the end for the Rockys.
With the Nationals out of the tournament, there was little reason to force a resumption.
And while the ever-competitive Scherzer is still trying to get a head start on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, the effects of the tie still affect the Rockies, who still have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockie's have made it to the big leagues by winning 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still have to fight for their first major league title.
"Even if we lose a game, we know that Denver will be packed, and the opposing team will perform at the highest level in every area we face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"
The Nationals have yet to announce a starter, but it looks like under the circumstances, they're gonna let Scherzer pitch.
Scherzer, who was scheduled to make his 34th start, had a good pitch on Thursday and it looks like he's going to be a starting pitcher on Sunday.
The Washington righty is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's remarks in West Virginia
The president took a hard look at the situation and referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, when he was talking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've made is at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from the most important election of our lives.
He's one of the great -- I'm not a candidate, but, in fact, I am, which is why I'm in every major candidate race, which is why".
Trump added, "You can see this terrible group of extremist Democrats, you can see what's happening right now.
And they do not hesitate to use any means necessary to take away power, greed, selfishness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they take over for control and power, we're not going to give them that".
The Democrats, he said, are meant to "harass and obstruct".
"As you have seen over the last four days", he said, "the Democrats are angry and self-righteous and disgusting and deceitful".
She named herself after Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who was applauded by the audience.
"Do you remember what he said?
Did you leak the documents?
What?
No, oh, no, I'm waiting for someone -- that's a bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen".
Labour will not continue to have much influence.
He's intolerant of what they think and what they say.
When the activists in my local Momentum party voted against me, it wasn't a big surprise.
In fact, I'm the last on the list of Labour MPs who were not welcome for saying what we all thought.
My member of Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way for speaking out against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship motion was about me being criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
From the importance of responsible economic policy to national security to Europe, Jeremy disagreed with his predecessors on a number of similar issues.
The headline on Friday's Nottingham East meeting said, "We want these meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In my eight years as a local Labour MP, that's what the GC meetings on Friday nights have been about.
Unfortunately, no one has ever thought of the word "gentle, respectful" in politics, if ever there was one.
It's becoming apparent that there are differences of opinion within the Labour Party and that opinions are being judged on whether they are acceptable to the party leadership.
It started when Jeremy became leader, when members of the party who shared the same political views with me turned 180 degrees and demanded that I accept positions I would never accept - both on national security and the UK single market.
Every time I spoke in public -- no matter what I said -- denouncing the centrist politics on social media and calling for me to be removed, harassment, came from people who said I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
That's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm more fortunate than some of my peers because the opinions that are thrown at me are often political.
I depend on my friends who deal with sexism and racism every day, professionally and honestly, but never shamefully.
One of the most disgusting aspects of the current politics is that the current level of harassment is considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The truth is, we don't get a unanimous vote on every motion of no confidence or when the party rules get tighter.
In the last two years, I've received a lot of messages telling me to lower my head, not to talk so much, and then I'll be okay.
But that's not why I'm in politics.
Thirty-two years ago, as a student, driven by the carelessness of the Thatcher government, I left my class and entered the public service where I was most needed - as a local councillor or government minister.
I never hid my political beliefs, not in the latest edition.
No one in East Nottingham will be left to wonder about my political views and my disagreements with the current leadership.
I would like to say to those who sponsored Friday's motion that as the country moves towards a Brexit that will be detrimental to our homes, businesses and public services, I do not understand why you would waste time and energy questioning my loyalty to the Labour Party leadership.
But my real message is not to support Nottingham, but to my constituents, whether or not they're members of the Labour Party, I'm proud to be working for you and I promise you that no threat or political expedient will deter me from continuing to work for what is in your best interests.
Chris Leslie is MP for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38-17 Melrose, leading the field with an undefeated season.
The two unexpected final attempts somehow changed the final result, but without any doubt, Ayr deserved the victory in the wonderful and fun day's game of the Tennent Championship.
They're at the top of the table, and they're the only team to have never lost all ten games.
At the end, they had a better defense, they had better chances, and the home team and coach Peter Murchie have every right to be happy.
"We've been tested so far and we haven't lost a single one, so we should be happy", he said.
Robyn Christi of Melrose added, "My honors to Ayr, for they used their chances better than we did".
Grant Anderson's 14-minute try, executed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but, a yellow card taken from Scottish captain Rory Hughes, left by the Warriors for the game, allowed Melrose to add points and Jason Baggot failed to execute the try.
Climo obstructed Ayr's lead with a penalty kick, and prior to that, at the end of the first half, he had a solo practice and Ayr went 17-5 into the half.
But Melrose got off to a great start in the second half and Patrick Anderson's practice, handled by Baggot, cut the gap by five points.
There was a long break afterwards due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who was taken off the bench and, on his return to the game, Ayr went further when Stafford McDowall's try was converted by Climo.
Then, Blair Macpherson Ayr's captain was stripped of his yellow card and once again Melros took advantage of being one more man with Bruce Colvine's failed attempt at a quick finish.
The home team came back and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card to stop Climo from having a ball from the penalty line, MacPherson hit the ground from behind the leading Ayr team's bull.
Climo scored, as he had almost done from the start, as Kyle Rowe caught a kick from David Armstrong and knocked out Gregor Henry's wing in the fifth home practice.
The star of the hit TV show "Still Game" is about to embark on a new career in the restaurant industry.
It seems that actress Kieran Ford is planning to jump into the hospitality industry after it was revealed that she has been named CEO of a large restaurant chain.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, of which he is a writer and co-star alongside longtime collaborator Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the show would be ending its ninth season, and it appears that Kiernan Craiglang is planning a life after.
According to official records, he's the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actress has declined to comment on the story, although sources in the Scottish Sun magazine said Kiernan was trying to get involved with a "leading restaurant brand" in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': Bolivia's interior hopes the courts will reopen the Pacific Ocean
The Marine Patrol's coverage of naval equipment headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings have a blue flag.
The first is that the human body is not a living thing.
It is our duty to recover it".
Across inland Bolivia, the bloody 19th century Chilean coastal conflict is still alive -- as people continue to seek to sail into the Pacific Ocean.
Those hopes may be stronger now than in decades, as Bolivia expects to be resolved by October 1st after five years of deliberation by international courts.
"Bolivia is living in a good moment, with a sense of unity and calm, and of course, it is looking forward to the result", says Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will be watching the international court's decision through big screens spread across the country, in the hope that the Hague Court will give Bolivia's claims a fair trial - after decades of negotiation - as Chile has been forced to negotiate a sovereign sea route to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charming indigenous president of Bolivia - who is desperately in the running for re-election next year - also made several contributions to Monday's resolution.
"We're very close to returning to the Pacific", he said last August.
Some analysts, however, believe that the court will not rule in favor of Bolivia and that, therefore, little will change.
The United Nations, based in the Netherlands, has no jurisdiction to hand over Chilean territory and has said it has no say in the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice's decision came six months after the negotiations ended indicates that the case was "not difficult", said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of advancing Bolivia's cause, they've been going backwards for the last four years.
"The issue of access to the sea has been taken as a prisoner by the current Bolivian administration", Zarate said.
He says President Morales' belligerent rhetoric has destroyed every desire left in Chile to do right.
Bolivia and Chile still have some issues to play out, but it's going to be very difficult to continue to discuss after that.
The two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
His predecessor, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, disagrees with what he calls the court's unusually hasty decision.
On Monday, it said Bolivia "has an extraordinary opportunity to re-establish relations with Chile" and "to end 139 years of disagreement for the benefit of both".
Calzadilla expressed his disagreement with those who say Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - is using the sea problem to gain political support.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"This decision is an opportunity we needed to see to overcome the past".
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen until it can convince the United States that it is right.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will not disarm until Washington can believe it.
Rick made that statement to the UN General Assembly.
He urged the United States to honor what it had promised at the Singapore summit in the presence of the rival leaders.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made the comments after Singapore was on the verge of re-blocking nuclear diplomacy with North Korea's Kim Jong Un for more than three months.
Rick says it's "utopian" to think that continued sanctions and US resistance to the declaration of the end of the Korean War will put North Korea on its feet.
Washington is not willing to agree to a confession before Pyongyang makes a move to lay down its arms.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is also a huge amount of skepticism about Pyongyang being serious about what the country supposedly believes is the only way to ensure its own security, giving up all weapons.
Pompeo is planning to travel to Pyongyang next month to host the second Kim-Trump summit.
At the Paris Fashion Show on High Street next door to you, he's showing off his new line of massive hats.
Whether you're looking to expand your collection of hats or to block out the sun completely, here's my answer.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne introduced a line of exotic oversized hats in the spring-summer 2019 collection, which shook the style shown at Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, a whole new generation of very impractical hats have hit Instagram and these designers have brought their spectacular designs to the catwalk.
Valentino's most notable pieces, a beige hat with a feather-like wing, covered the heads of the models.
Other large-sized accessories include a kind of jewelled ant, a rather odd hat, and even a pineapple-like one -- but they're not designed to be mind-blowing.
Thom Brown also showed off his collection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of these colorful masks have lips sewn together that look more like Hannibal Lecter's than a high-end tailor's.
One was a scuba mask with a tube and a pair of glasses, and the other was a little ice cream cone.
If you're a fashion fan, I have good news for you.
The stylists say the hatred will spread to the streets, even to your own people.
The oversize hats are the next big thing from La Bomba, the two-foot wide-winged straw hat that we've seen so many celebrities wear, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the impractical hat that has been a hit on social media has taken another item to the corridor - a straw bag for the beach, almost as big as the bathing suit model she is wearing.
The orange-red bag, cut with a fine silk sheet and finished with a white leather handle, was the star of Jacquames's La Riviera 2019 Spring-Summer collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage said in FEMAIL, "I hope big hats and big beach bags hit the streets next summer, but with the high profile the designer has been, it would be hard to ignore the demand for giant accessories".
John Edward: Basic language skills for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland have records of academic excellence, which they have continued in 2018, with outstanding exam results which have been reinforced with outstanding individual and team results in sports, art, music and other community projects.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools, the Scottish Council of Independent Schools, are trying to provide the best service between students and their parents.
The purpose of independent schools is to prepare students for higher education, for the career of their choice and as citizens.
Because we as an education sector can design and implement personalized school curricula, we have found that modern languages continue to be the most popular choice of students.
Nelson Mandela said this: "If you talk to someone in a language they understand, you get into their head.
But if you speak to him in his language, you will reach his heart".
It's a powerful way of reminding us that we shouldn't use English alone to build relationships with people in other countries and gain their trust.
We can see from the latest survey results this year that language is at the top of the best scores in independent schools.
68% of students who study foreign languages get the highest A rating.
The data, collected from SCIS schools of 74 students, showed that 72 percent of the students had the highest A in Mandarin Chinese; 72 percent in German; 69 percent in French; and 63 percent in Spanish.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland see foreign languages as an unquestionably essential skill that young people and children will need in the future.
Languages are now studied as a core subject (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools and other curricula.
A 2014 UK Commission survey found that one of the main reasons for being considered for a job was a lack of knowledge of the language.
Knowledge of languages is becoming increasingly essential to prepare young people for the careers of the future.
With more and more job opportunities that require languages, these skills are becoming essential in a globalized world.
Whatever career you choose, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with a lifelong advantage.
The ability to talk to people in foreign countries directly automatically puts the bald person at the top of the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language in a normal conversation, and that number rose to two-digit figures of 15 percent for those who spoke only French.
That's why it's so important to invest in language teaching for today's children.
Speaking more than one language, which is mostly used in economically developing countries, will give your children better chances of finding a better job.
In Scotland, schools make a distinction based on the language they teach.
A significant number of learners prefer more classical modern languages, and others prefer languages that appear to be important for EBA by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a wide range of language learning opportunities in an independent school with teachers who are experts in their field.
The purpose of independent schools in Scotland is to prepare and equip children to succeed in the future in a variety of fields.
We can't deny that now, in a global business environment, where languages are vital to the future of a country, so education has to reflect that.
In fact, modern languages should be understood as international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer their choice, diversity and excellence to the youth of Scotland.
It has to be done.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron is making his Lakers debut Monday in San Diego.
The wait for LeBron James to make his Los Angeles debut is about to end.
Lakers head coach Luke Walton has announced that James will be playing in Monday's preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But he hasn't said how many minutes he's going to play.
"One more and 48 less", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will play with a time limit.
After the training this week, James was asked about the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need a pre-season game to prepare me for this stage of my career", he replied.
Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will kick off a campaign rally tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This will be the first of five rallies for Trump this coming week, and will see him visit a number of places with his supporters, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
In anticipation of the vote that would give him the confidence to fill the Supreme Court, Trump is looking for support for the midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress in the November midterm elections.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can it be watched online?
Trump's tour of West Virginia is scheduled to begin at 7:00 p.m. today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the rally in West Virginia online.
It appears that Trump will be leading the hearing of this week's nomination of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, as the FBI investigates your sexual misconduct pending confirmation by the Senate, which has voted to support you.
But the main purpose of this tour of rallies is to help the Republicans win votes in the November general election.
So, President Trump's campaign says the goal of these five rallies next week is to "revitalise the volunteer pool and help the Republicans maintain their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives".
"The Congress's opposition is of paramount importance, and the president will try to travel to as many states as possible as he enters the campaign", said a Trump campaign spokesman, who did not want to be identified.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally will allow for extensive coverage to fans from all over Ohio and Pennsylvania and the media in Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will mark Trump's second visit to West Virginia in the past month, a state he won with 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is actually trying to help Republican Senator Patrick Morrissey of Virginia, who is following him.
It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has to go there to help with his campaign", says Simon Header, a political scientist at West Virginia University, as quoted by Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA will try to keep up in Sunday's singles competition.
After three one-on-one sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursome seemed to be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The key moment is a sporting concept invented from the ground up, which the players believe in, but not for other competitions.
So where do you think it's time to go now?
"They had a six-point lead and now they have four, so I think it's time, in a way", Jordan Spieth said, when he made the one-day field.
Of course, Europe has a four-point lead of the 12 available.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel the wind is not in their favor, and they need help, especially Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together and scored three points out of four.
Spieth was absolutely decisive, from the tie to the green, and he's leading by example.
The cheers grew louder as the round progressed, and he hit a major putt, winning four all-squares after Thomas lost two in a row.
He celebrated with another similar shout to the winning putt in Game 15, indicating that the American team was not out of the tournament.
"You have to find your strength and focus on your game", Spieth said.
It's all those punks have left.
18 holes to make up the difference.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, two historic Ryder Cup players.
These rare but charming European couples. Four out of four are sure to fail.
"Moliwood" was the only couple not to throw a bogey on a Saturday afternoon, but they avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the final nine on Friday.
That round and the energy that came from the crowd made them a match to be beaten on Sunday and there was no more famous European player than Fleetwood and Molinari to seal Europe's victory at sunrise at Le Golf National.
I'd rather have them in separate holes.
It's still too early to talk about the big Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson have accelerated the work of Sergio Garcia, the best of the quartet, who was tied with Alex No.
They've got a bogey and two doubles in front of the Spaniard and the Swede at the hole he's never been close to.
And yet, on Sunday, there was no one to help you out of your hole.
The foursome was fascinated by watching up close the interaction between couples, the advice they gave, what they didn't give, and seeing how the strategy could be changed in an instant.
Europe performed better as a team, and had a significant lead in the final, but the foursome showcased the U.S. team's fighting spirit, despite some, especially Stateside, questioning it.
Europe leads 10-6 in the Ryder Cup final.
Europe has a significant lead in the Ryder Cup final after Saturday's four-way tie with the United States 10-6.
The inspired pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari secured two victories over the hard-working Tiger Woods, and scored their four most valuable points to date at Le Golf Nationale.
Europe's Thomas Bjorn, trying to win back the trophy he lost to Hazelin two years ago, dominated this morning, winning the series 3-1.
The U.S. fought harder, won two games, but couldn't break the lead.
They needed eight points from Jim Fury in 12 individual games Sunday to retain the lead.
Fleetwood is the only European rookie to score four points in a row and along with Molini, who are nicknamed "Molliwood" after a great weekend, they are second in the history of the Ryder Cup tournament with four points from four games.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball, he played his game perfectly as they beat tired Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau by a clear 5-4 score.
Woods, after two games of somehow-out Saturday, showed some brilliance, but lost 19 of his 29 games at fourball and foursome, 7 in a row.
Justin Rose took a break for the morning's four-ball and returned with Henrik Stenson to beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - the world's best and third-ranked - 2&1 in the fours.
Europe did not find its way in the cool, pleasant days of southwestern Paris.
Three-time champions Jordan Spiethe and Justin Thomas set the two-point line for the Americans on Saturday.
They achieved a 2-1 loose victory over Spaniard Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and then also defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the 4&3 fours after losing the opening two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup tournament has a team managed to break the four-point gap and enter the singles, although Fury's side needed only a draw to retain the trophy.
Once he's second best in two days, after the disruption against Sunday, they'll be ahead of him.
North Korea has been very adamant about not laying down their arms without any confidence.
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that sanctions continue to undermine trust in the United States and that they will not stop developing nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken "significant and benevolent measures" last year, including halting nuclear weapons and missile tests, abandoning sites for nuclear testing, and pledging to stop developing nuclear technology and weapons.
"However, we do not see a satisfactory response from the United States", he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and in any case, we cannot leave our weapons alone first".
Rick echoes familiar North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance as part of a phased process toward denuclearization in which North Korea would be rewarded for taking gradual steps.
Rik Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump refer to the first summit of the US president and North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim pledged to "denuclearize the Korean Peninsula", and Trump vowed to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has insisted that Pyongyang lay down its weapons first.
Washington has ignored international calls for easing sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States reiterates that it must lay down its weapons first and continues to increase the level of sanctions pressure to force them to achieve their goal, and is opposed to the 'Declaration on the End of War'", Rik said.
"The idea that the lashes will make us stand on their feet is utopian for those who do not know us.
The problem is that continued punishment is driving up distrust".
Rick has omitted any mention of the second Kim-Trump summit announced earlier this week by the US leader at the UN.
The minister, however, mentioned three meetings in the last five months between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in, adding that if the other side were South Korea instead of the United States, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not be blocked.
However, the tone of Ri's speech would be completely different last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea was inevitably targeting the US with missiles, after Trump called him "Mr. Devil President" "Mr. Kim" "Mr. Missile" "suicide mission".
At the United Nations earlier this year, Trump, who has vowed to "destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking the step to lay down his weapons, but said there was still work to be done and that sanctions would continue until North Korea was denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump made it clear he didn't have time for that, whether it was two years ago, three years ago, or five months ago -- it doesn't matter".
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should recognize Pyongyang for its courageous actions.
But the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, told the UN Security Council on Thursday, "The Security Council's sanctions must continue to be enforced, without fail, until we can verify that their denuclearization is real".
The Security Council has unanimously supported sanctions imposed on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to stop Pyongyang's funding of its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later announced that he would visit Pyongyang again to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has been to North Korea three times this year, but the last one didn't work out.
When he returned from Pyongyang in July, saying he had accomplished only one thing for North Korea, hours after he had been accused of making demands like gangsters".
North Korea had promised at a meeting with Moon that they would give up their missile sites and nuclear complex if the United States took appropriate measures.
He told Kim that the "appropriate measures" he was looking for included the security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore and talked about moving toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students took a course on getting enough rest.
This year's class at Harvard University will be encouraging undergraduates to sleep more, to try to counter the growing culture of students drinking coffee at night.
A professor recently noticed that at the best university in the world, students miss out on a prize as a basic self-care tool.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospitals, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the UK.
She started the course when she gave a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation while she was still a student.
"A girl came up to me at the end and said, 'Why do I have to do this alone now, in my last year of school?'
He said that no one had ever told him how important it was to sleep well, which surprised me.
The course, offered for the first time this year, explains to students the impact of good sleep habits on academic and athletic performance, as well as improving their well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of health services at the university, said the university decided to implement the course after seeing that its students were getting less sleep during the week.
The full-time course covers several interactive sections.
One part is a picture of a bedroom where students press coffee mugs, curtains, trainers, and books to see the effect of caffeine and light, and the effect of too little sleep on athletic performance and the importance of bedtime habits.
Another chapter tells the subjects that not getting enough sleep increases the risk of heart attack, depression, or cancer.
A campus map, using interactive icons, invites participants to reflect on their daily habits.
We know we can't change the habits of students overnight.
"We believe that the most important thing is to protect the environment and the environment from harmful substances", says Dr. Czeisler.
There is still a culture of pride in doing gaupasa, he says, and the increasing pressure on modern technology and students increases the problem of doing little gaupasa.
A good night's sleep, coupled with good quality sleep, should be the secret weapon against stress, fatigue, and nervousness -- but also against weight gain, because not getting enough sleep makes your brain feel hungry, and you're always going to be hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, and was one of his first classes in his first year at Harvard.
She stated that the course opened her eyes and encouraged her to participate in a course that took on the campus fabric.
The next step, he hopes, would be to require graduate students to undertake a comparable research before joining a competing institution.
Czeisler recommends that students set an alarm to tell them when to go to bed, as well as to wake them up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can alter circadian rhythms, and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers Mengas defeated Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another defeat as Dolly Menga's strike set them 1-0 to Steven Gerrard at Livingston.
They were hoping to win their first ever title since a 4-1 defeat at St Johnstone in February at Ibrox, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's team's second defeat in his 18th game as manager, with his eight points allowing Hearts, leaders of the Landbrokes Championship, to escape uncontrolled.
Menga had the strike seven minutes before halftime, and the Rangers' hard work didn't bring the tie.
The Rangers are now down to sixth place, while Livingston are up to third and are only behind Hibernian on goal difference.
The problem could have been even worse for the Rangers when wingman Calum Spence was treated for a severe head injury after allegedly being hit by an object thrown from outside.
Gerrard made eight substitutions and helped Ayr reach the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, was running with Livi 11, who took a point from the Hearts last week and would be happy to see his well-fitting outfits drown out his opponents on every tour.
The Rangers had the field, but Livingston took advantage of their play.
A goal from Mengas wingman Scott Pittman, scored by Allan McGregor, should have been scored, but the centre-half missed the opportunity.
A deep free throw by Keaghan Jacobs found captain Craig Halkett, but his teammate Alan Lithgow only managed to get him out of the back post.
The Rangers took control, but in the last third of their game, it seemed like the odds were higher than they thought.
Alfredo Morelos felt he should have gotten a penalty at the end of the fourth quarter when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson declined to hear the Colombian's appeal.
He managed to make only two Rangers shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's light kick.
Livi's first goal in the 34th minute might have hurt the game, but no one can deny that they were worth it, at least given the effort.
Once again, the Rangers failed to take on Jacobs's blocked shot.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who calmly chose Menga for a simple end.
Gerrard intervened in the break by swapping Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and the change had an immediate effect as the wing passed to Morelos, but the formidable Kelly ran out of his line to block.
But Livingston continued to force the outsiders to play their favourite game, with Lithgow and Halkett playing long after long passes.
Holt's team had the opportunity to increase their lead, but McGregor held firm before he made a headbutt coming from Lithgow corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton again called for a penalty at the end when he was stuck with Jacobs, but Thomson again ignored him.
Almanac: inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity: from this invention came what is known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has been a landmark of science, and has also become a landmark of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" starring the unlikely cowboys Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter. It's used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the atomic effects of the radioactivity of minerals".
Evans: Yeah, it's playing right now.
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention bearing his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach your immune system to see malignant cells.
A new cancer vaccine can teach your immune system to detect malignant cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of the treatment.
It involves taking immune cells from the patient and then altering them in the lab.
Then they can look at a protein that is common in many cancers and then re-inject it.
The vaccine in the trial is showing very good results on patients with many types of cancer.
In one case, a woman who was treated with a vaccine that teaches her immune system to recognize malignant cells, they were able to eliminate ovarian cancer in just over 18 months.
So this is how you take immune cells from a patient, and you alter them in the lab to "see" a common protein in many cancers called HER2, and then you re-inject them into the cells.
Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results show that we have a vaccine that promises greatly".
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung, and colon and rectal cancer, explains Professor Berzofsky.
So a similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and trying to figure out how to get to the carcinogenic cells has worked in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West got into a pro-Trump rant wearing a MAG hat after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't work.
Kanye West was shouted at in the studio on Saturday Night Live when he praised President Donald Trump of the United States and said he would run for president again in 2020.
After the third song of the night, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great hat, began to speak out against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Every time I talk to a white person, they say, 'Why do you like Trump, he's a racist?'
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago", he said.
The series opened with a sketch starring Matt Damon on SNL in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, West's insulting speech was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock West was trying to embarrass himself by publishing it.
West also complained publicly that he had a bad time with his hat between his wings.
"They've caught me in the wings.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat".
I'm being attacked!
And then they say I'm in a ruined place", she said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on, "Do you want to see where we're at the bottom?" saying, "I'm gonna put on my Superman cape, which means you can't tell me what to do.
Try the love".
Her words led to at least a couple of whistles from the audience and the SNL crew seemed to be embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person who was there telling the magazine, "The whole studio was completely silent".
West was brought in at the last minute to replace Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend, rapper Rac Miller, had been murdered a few days earlier.
The Web shocked a lot of people with their rendition of I Love It by a guy dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West was backed by conservative TPUSA leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest inspirations, thank you for taking on a lot of the mafia".
But as the talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted, West was simply "being who he is, and that's great".
"But I do NOT intend to reward a person who embraces an ideology that is harmful to the community (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his art)".
He's free.
And so are we".
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he was now known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name, and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg also goes by the name Snoop Lion, not to mention the late music legend Prince, who changed his name to an icon and made him the artist Prince.
Charged with attempted murder for stabbing in a Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed to death in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The accused is to appear in the First District Court in Belfast on Monday.
The D.A.'s office will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has come forward to testify against his toxic masculinity.
Kit Harington is best known for his role as swordsman Jon Snow in the HBO medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actress has challenged the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that such roles on screen often make young men feel they have to be tough to be respected.
In statements to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believes "something has gone wrong" and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who also recently married 31-year-old Rose Leslie, also a star of Game of Thrones, admitted that he "believes" the problem needs to be addressed.
"Personally, and with a lot of conviction, I'm thinking at this point - what have we done wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What have we been teaching men as they grow up to be in the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television may also have a role to play in the rise of toxic masculinity, due to the presence of very masculine characters.
He continued, 'What is natural and what is taught?
What is it that is taught on TV, on the streets, that makes young boys feel that they have to be men?
I think this is one of the great issues of our time. How can we change that?
'Cause it's obvious something went wrong with these young men.
He also admitted in the interview that he will not make a predecessor or successor to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying he is "done with the battlefields and the horses".
Starting in November, Kit will star in Sam Shepard's True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he feels meeting his wife Rose is the best thing Game of Thrones has ever given him.
'I met my wife on this show, and she gave me my future family and my life from now on,' he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the woman loved by Jon Snow's character Kit, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family's estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of citizens infected with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country are now infected, according to health officials.
More than 40,000 new cases have been reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases are sexually transmitted, which is a change from what we know.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some areas of China through contaminated blood transfusions.
But this approach has brought the number of new HIV cases down to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Yet, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Because of the conservative values in this country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry a woman.
Many of the transmission of diseases is due to the use of inappropriate sexual protections.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of efforts to combat the problem.
Maxine Waters has denied the GOP senator data leaked by her staff, turning "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories" upside down.
U.S. Attorney Maxine Waters on Saturday alleged that a member of her staff published personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Democrats in Los Angeles said the accusations were inspired by "ultra-right" experts and websites.
"Lies, lies and more vile lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information included information from three U.S. senators, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was posted online Tuesday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate Committee hearing on allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source was associated with Waters' office and published information from a member of Waters' staff, Hill said.
"This baseless allegation is completely false and a complete lie", Waters continued.
"My staff members - whose identity, personal information and safety have been compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations - decline any responsibility for the leak of such information.
This unfounded allegation is completely false and a complete lie".
Waters' statement was immediately met with criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This cancellation is a pre-made decision", wrote Fleischer.
"That proves he has no character for Congressman.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
He must not show any defiance.
He must not question the motives of the accuser.
She must appear calm and temperate".
It seemed Fleischer was trying to contrast Waters's reaction to the Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican nominee who is seeking to remove Waters in the midterm elections, tweeted his thoughts.
"Significant if it's really real", he tweeted.
In his testimony, Waters said that his office had notified "appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities regarding such fraudulent statements.
"We ensure that those who have broken the law will be identified", he continued, "and that they will be held accountable before the law for any act that is harmful and dangerous to any member of my staff and all members".
Johnny English Strikes Again - a parody of the low-powered spy Rowan Atkinson
It has now become traditional to look for the meaning of Brexit in any new film with a British twist, and that does not seem to apply to the parody franchise of the action comedy Johnny English.
By satirizing ourselves on a story that shows so clearly what a piece of crap we are, are we going to create a new export opportunity for our nation?
Anyway, the big-eyed, rubber-faced, incompetent Johnny English has renewed his license to mess things up for the second time. His name proves above all that he is nothing more than a comic creation designed for non-English-speaking film-watching territories.
Despite his unusual desire for glamour, he's a silly secret agent who looks a little like Clouseau, but of course he's a bit of Mr Bean and a little bit of a guy who helps Chariots of Fire with a single note at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
In the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, it's also based on the mysterious international traveler played by Atkinson, leaving chaos behind.
There are a couple of good moments on JE's last excursion.
I loved the way Johnny English approached the helicopter wearing a medieval armor and the rotor crosses were hitting the helmet.
Atkinson's gift for comedy is evident on screen, but humor is lacking in strength and is too superfluous, especially when even film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible now include comedy among their components.
The humor seems more geared toward children than adults, and to me Johnny English's absurd adventures aren't as clever or intelligent as the jokes of Bean's character in Atkinson's silent movies.
The main premise is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated the super-secret spy network of the UK, exposing the identities of all British agents working there, and that has upset the acting agent, which is a small role for Kevin Eldon.
That's a bit much for a prime minister with a pompous, haunted character who is already losing her political standing completely: Emma Thompson looks her best with a character that almost resembles Teresa May, but the script doesn't help much.
His intelligence advisors inform him that, in fact, all of his spy assets are at risk, and he will have to recruit a retired spy.
Now he's a teacher in a fancy place, but he's giving secret classes on acting as a secret agent, some pretty good jokes, because English offers a "School of Rock" kind of spy academy.
English is taken back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing, where he is reunited with his former partner Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, tied to a U-boat commander, and Vicki Pepperdine is a little bit lost in this rich-boy role.
So we have Batman and Robin again, making things miserable for His Highness's Secret Service, meeting Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is obsessed with a tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer misery, played by the cunning billionaire Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their farcical adventures: disguised as waitresses, they set fire to a French restaurant, creating chaos by sneaking into Volta's luxury yacht, and English sets off into complete anarchy when he tries to use his virtual reality helmets to see what Volta's house looks like from the inside.
All the stops are made looking at this final sequence, but while it's nice and noisy, it's all very much like children's TV.
It was kind of weird.
And as I've seen with a number of other Johnny English films, I've been thinking, can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role worthy of her talent?
The Labour Party has denied that they are working on a plan to make the British work four days a week and get paid five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is currently considering a radical plan to allow Britons to work one day a week and be paid five days a week.
It seems like the bosses of the companies want the party to give their employees the savings from the AI revolution by giving them one more day off.
The workers would have a three-day weekend, but they would still take home the same salary.
Sources say the idea fits "well" into the party's economic agenda and its attempt to turn the country to the workers' side.
The move to a four-day workweek has been supported by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of a changing economy.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: 'They are planning to announce a policy review before the end of the year.
It won't happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is a step closer to the party's vision of rebalancing the economy in favor of the working class and the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the party to support such an idea, as the Green Party defended a four-day workweek during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the aspiration has not yet received the full support of the Labour Party.
The Labour Party voter is quoted as saying, "The four-day workweek is not the policy of the party, and the party does not support it".
The shadow minister, John McDonnell, used the Labour Party Congress last week to define his vision for a socialist economic revolution.
Mr. McDonnell was adamant that "faceless executives" and "speculators" should be stripped of their power in corporate public services.
The Shadow Minister's plan also includes the possibility that current shareholders of water companies may not get their full share, as a Labour government may make deductions if it finds that there has been some wrongdoing.
He further confirmed that there were plans to include workers in corporate boards and to create Inclusive Property Funds to give 10% of the capital of private sector companies to employees who could collect annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh might change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and has raised questions about whether the findings of the investigation could lead to the removal of his support from a Republican senator.
In an interview aired Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if he could get the FBI to find out anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his fellow South Carolina candidate.
"I think so, of course", said Kennedy.
"I said on the way to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
And I called him after this happened, and he came forward with the allegation, and I said, "You did that?"
He responded with firmness, clarity, and unhesitating determination".
Graham's vow, however, seems to be written on the stone.
"I have reached a decision regarding Brett Kavanaugh and he will face charges including attempted bombing", he said.
"Mr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett stubbornly denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one he mentions could verify his claims.
He's only 36.
I don't see anything new that's changed".
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival is in New York City, an annual music event that brings together some of the greatest artists with a simple mission: to end poverty in the world.
Now in its 17th edition, the Global Citizen's Festival will bring thousands of people to the Grand Arena in Central Park, not only to enjoy performances by artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's true purpose, which is to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen's Festival, founded in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting poverty.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), those who wish to attend the concert must complete various tasks or "actions", such as sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or making a call in some other useful way to help raise awareness of the goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been when he has 12 years left to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of encouraging people to take action by doing a free concert original, or is it just another case of what's called clicktivism, which is trying to make people feel like they're making a real difference by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" by its followers, pressuring them to meet various targets.
It says that world leaders have been led to announce policies and commitments worth more than $37 trillion, policies and commitments that will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from the activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or received.
The team estimates that the guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on about 649 million people worldwide.
Key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based "association of investors and implementers committed to helping children develop their full potential". It has pledged to donate $35 million to Rwanda to help eradicate malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizen members like you, we will make the social injustice of malnutrition history", Tracey Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told a crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
In addition, the group said that after undertaking more than 5,000 actions to improve maternal and infant nutrition in the UK, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will benefit 5 million women and children through nutrition-related interventions.
In response to this one of the FAQs on their website, "What makes you think we can actually eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen said, "It's going to be a long and hard road, and there are times when we're going to fall and we're going to fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will make it, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe will be performing at this year's event in New York City, hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the military as a blockade against Russian energy exports.
If necessary, Washington could use its military to block Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke has said, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke has argued that Russia's relationship with Syria -- where the legitimate government is apparently operating at the behest of the government -- is merely a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to deal with energy, like they do in Eastern Europe, in the southern belly of Europe", he said, according to the report.
And according to the officer, there are ways and means to handle this.
"The United States, with our military, has the ability to ensure that the sea lines are kept open, and, if necessary, block them to ensure that their energy does not reach their market", he said.
Zinke was addressing attendees at an event organized by the Energy Alliance for Consumers, a nonprofit group that bills itself as the "voice of energy for consumers" in the United States.
Washington compared its approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, and found that they are essentially the same.
"The economic option we have with respect to Iran and Russia is roughly to exploit and replace fuels", he said, referring to Russia as a "single source" economy that is highly dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration is on a mission to promote the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and replace it with Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, officials of the Trump administration, and even the US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which in Trump's words makes Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 million Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin says Washington's fierce opposition to the project is purely economic in nature, and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we're all agreed that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. response has been met with a negative response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main German industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries, has called on the United States to avoid interfering in the UK's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a serious problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply", Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), told German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin after a recent meeting.
Elizabeth Warren will "carefully consider" running for president in 2020, the Massachusetts senator said.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said Saturday she would seriously consider running for president after midterm elections.
While in a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
"It's time for women to come to Washington and fix our broken government, and that requires a woman at the top", she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president".
Warren made a comment about Donald Trump in the City Hall, saying that he was "leading the country down the wrong path".
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren has been outspoken in his criticism of Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Obviously, we need an FBI investigation before we vote".
However, a new poll released Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's voters don't think he should run for president in 2020.
Forty-eight percent of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run for president, according to a poll by the Suffolk University Center for Political Research/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent were in favor of running.
Polls show that Deval Patrick's chances of running for governor are higher, with 38% supporting a possible candidacy and 48% against.
Other names that have emerged as potential 2020 nominees include Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said he would make a formal decision by January, as reported by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin referred to Track Palin's mix of post-traumatic stress during Donald Trump's campaign.
Track Palin, 26, served a year in Iraq after joining in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence Monday night.
"For what my son is going through, for what he's going through now that he's back, I feel identified with the mixed effects of post-traumatic stress disorder and the other families who are dealing with the vulnerability that our soldiers bring with their return", she told a crowd of supporters of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said the arrest was "a significant matter", and she said of her son and other war veterans "they come back a little changed, they come back stronger, they come back wondering if there is that same respect that the other soldiers they have and the members of the air force and all the other members of the military have given to their country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with one count of domestic violence against a woman, including a domestic violence charge and a false statement of possession of a firearm while intoxicated, according to Wasilla Police spokesman Dan Bennett.
18 states, D.C. supporting an appeal against the new asylum policy.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new US policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and counties filed a statement of friendship Friday in Washington to support a former asylum seeker, defying police, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy has not been released.
She claimed to have been sexually abused by her partner "and members of her violent gang", but her asylum application was denied by US officials on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
The state attorneys who are defending Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as the countries that generate the largest number of asylum seekers in the United States because they are countries with widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy was reversed by a recent decision by the U.S. Immigration Appeals Board, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new police force "is ignoring decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law provides that all asylum applications must be assigned based on the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a bar is a violation of that principle", the amicus curiae brief stated.
In addition, the lawyers argued in the brief that the policy of denying entry to immigrants is detrimental to the U.S. economy because they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and provide "the labor force we need".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of persecution due to their race, religion, nationality or membership in a social group or political opinion", said Sessions when he introduced the policy on June 11.
Asylum itself has never been a solution to all the problems that people all over the world face every day, no matter how serious the problems.
Desperate rescue efforts continue in Palu as the death toll doubles as the race for survivors continues.
For the survivors, the situation was even more dire.
"There's a lot of tension", said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, a mother, as she calmed her feverish son in the devastated city of Palu.
"Ambulances are coming every minute.
Clean water is lacking".
They've seen residents return to their destroyed homes, pick up their water-drained belongings, trying to save whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals were destroyed in the 7.5 magnitude quake, overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, such as Dwi Haris, with broken back and shoulder, were resting outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated externally due to continuous aftershocks.
Tears were streaming from his eyes as he told how he had experienced the violent shaking of the earthquake when he was in his hotel room with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I just crashed into the sands of the wall", Haris told The Associated Press, adding that her family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard her screaming for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him and his daughter.
I hope they're all safe".
The US ambassador accused China of "aggression" with propaganda ads.
After a Chinese official newspaper placed a four-page ad in a US newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump in the Des Moines Register, the second-best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa, mentioned the surcharge he paid on Wednesday after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 US congressional elections, an accusation China denies.
Trump's accusation of Beijing interfering in the US election marked a reversal of what US officials told Reuters was a growing campaign in Washington to put pressure on China.
While it's normal for foreign governments to put up ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a escalating trade war in which each has put a thorn in the other's imports.
China's retaliatory spikes, which supported Trump's Republican Party early in the trade war, were intended to attack exports from states like Iowa, Chinese and U.S. experts say.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and longtime governor of Iowa, one of the world's largest exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has been harming American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad is quoted in an article in Sunday's Des Moines Register as saying, "China is now intensifying its attack by placing propaganda ads in our free press".
"By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government is leveraging a strong tradition of free press and freedom of the press in America by placing paid ads in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in the newsstand right here on the street in Beijing, there are few dissident voices and there is no honest reflection of the differences of opinion that the Chinese people may have about China's troubled economic course, as the media are under the strict control of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most popular newspapers had refused the offer to publish his article, but did not say which newspaper it was.
Republicans are scaring away female voters ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh's election defeat, analysts warn.
With many Republican leaders waiting to be sworn in and defending Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court nominee in the face of multiple sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned of a drop in popularity, especially among women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The excitement around this issue has been incredibly high, and the majority of Republicans have registered to show that they want to go ahead with the vote.
There is no going back on these things", Grant Reeher, a professor at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill in reference to an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that the pressure that Senator Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., might exert in support of an FBI investigation will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget tomorrow, and they will not forget in November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters shouting "November is coming!" were protesting outside the Senate that the Republicans, who control the Judiciary Committee, decided to go ahead with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, he said at the Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be out of place", said independent political analyst Stu Rothenberg to the news website.
"People say he's already had an impact; it's true.
But it could have a much bigger impact, especially among suburban women and young people, between 18 and 29 years old, who don't have a fixed voting system, given that even if they don't like their president, they often don't actually vote".
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing his sexual assault against his Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that there might be a decline if Republicans decided to go ahead with the resumption.
"It's become a big upset for the Republican Party", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee vote, the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh should sit on the bench, it's about how the Republicans handled this issue and how they treated this woman", Guy Cecil, executive director of the Democratic election campaign group Priorities USA, told the news channel.
However, the American people seem to be quite divided between Ford's and Kavanaugh's testimony when it comes to deciding which one to believe, but it seems that a little more people are in favor of the latter.
A recent YouGov poll showed that 41 percent of respondents were certain or likely to believe Ford's testimony, and 35 percent were certain or likely to believe Kavanaugh's.
In addition, 38% said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied in his testimony, and 30% said the same about Ford.
Under pressure from Flake, the allegations made by Ford are currently being investigated by the FBI, and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, as reported by The Guardian.
Last week, he testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Ford was drunk and attacked Kavanaugh when he was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed him his genitals at a party when they were students at Yale in the 1980s.
The man who invented the World Wide Web is going to start a new kind of Internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, wants to start a startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's Solid open source software platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who will have access to that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was to "take over the world".
"We have to do it now", he said of the startup.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal data repository" or POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, music store, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify: all of them are available to you in one single browser, all at the same time.
The distinctive feature of a personal online database is that it is entirely up to the user who can access a particular type of information.
The company calls it "empowering people through data".
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is to put together the right resources, processes, and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, a few developers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not "talking to Facebook and Google about the need to make a radical change as their business models change radically overnight.
"We're not asking them for permission".
In a post posted on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide an ecosystem and commercial power that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet completely when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
For the past few months, Berners-Lee has been the most influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain a founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very, very optimistic about this next era of the Internet", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann, a cleric honored with the Victoria Cross of the First World War
The only Church of England clergyman to receive the Victoria Cross as a veteran of the First World War has been honoured in his home town for the first time in 100 years.
The distinguished Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won his award on September 29, 1918 during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later, and never knew he had been awarded Britain's highest military honour.
A memorial plaque was unveiled by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "very symbolic" that the stone was exhibited 100 years after his grandfather was given the award.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal as it was "very tightly packed and under constant cannon and machine gun fire".
Then he moved quickly to the first line of fire, and with the greatest courage he led the line forward until he found a cannon he single-handedly and shot down three of the landing parties.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said he knew of his grandfather's actions "that he could never have done himself, but that it brings a great humility".
She and her brother, Dr. James Vann, laid a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it was a great honor for him to take part in the parade" and added "it proves the courage of a true hero the support he will get from many people".
The MMA fans had been waiting all night to see Bellator 206, but they got Peppa Pig instead.
Say you're up all night watching a packed Bellator 206, and then they won't let you watch the main show.
The San Jose billboard featured 13 fights, including six on the main schedule, and was scheduled to be broadcast live in the UK on Channel 5 tonight.
At 6:00 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight each other, UK viewers were stunned when the coverage switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were not surprised after staying up until the wee hours of the morning deliberately to fight.
One follower described Twitter's change to children's cartoons as a "bad joke".
"A government law states that this content was inappropriate for 6:00 a.m., and they had to change it to children's programming", said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the show.
"Peppa the pig, yes".
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they will be reviewing programming to take UK viewers into account in the future.
"I think when I think about repetition, it seems to me that we can probably fix it", Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock Sunday morning there, and we can't fix it until Sunday of our time, Monday of their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the change was made, I got a lot of messages back and forth, and not all of them were very nice.
We tried to solve it, but we thought it was a technical glitch.
But it wasn't. It was a government thing.
I promise it won't happen again.
We're going to play five fights instead of six, like we usually do, and we tried to get more people to play, but we screwed up.
It's a situation that's unfortunately bound to happen".
Tom Daley's "disdain for sex" is a little bit of a mystery.
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling undervalued by others because of sex, but that's what motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said that he didn't realize "that not everyone was like him" until he went to high school.
In her first talk on Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne on Radio 4, she said she spoke about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that being a parent made winning the Olympics less important to him.
The longtime regular host of the show, Kirsty Young, has announced that she will be taking several months off due to illness.
After her complete loss in Laverne's first program, Daley said she felt "undervalued" compared to everyone else because society did not allow her to like boys and girls".
She said, "To this day, the very same feeling that makes you feel inferior and different has been the real reason that gave me the power and the strength to succeed".
He wanted to prove that he was "something", he said, because he didn't want people to be disappointed when they found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBTQ promoter, and used her participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
She said she came forward because she felt she was lucky to be able to live openly without any consequences and wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said her love for a man - Dustin Lance Black, the American filmmaker she met in 2013 - "took her by surprise".
Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years her senior last year, but said the age difference wasn't a problem between them.
He said, "When you're so young and you go through so much" -- he went to his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later -- it's hard to find someone of his own age who's gone through the same experience.
The couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said his "entire outlook" has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, 'I'm going to win a gold medal,' all I was thinking about", she said.
"And, you know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
His son shares the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father never believed that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked for was if they could get him tickets to the London 2012 Games, because he wanted to be on the front line.
"I couldn't tell him you wouldn't be able to sit in the front row, Dad", he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn't until he stopped breathing and died that I accepted that he was not invincible", she said.
The next day Daley competed in the 2012 Olympic Games, where she won a bronze medal.
"I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life, to stand in front of the local crowd at the Olympic Games, there was no greater feeling", she said.
It also inspired her first song selection - Proud, by Heather Small - which made her feel identified throughout the entire process of preparing for the Olympic Games and which still gives her the chicken-ass.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not in shape, sat on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson is going to set a new record when he plays Game 47 of the Ryder Cup on Sunday, but he's going to have to work on his form or he's going to look bad.
Mickelson was breaking a record by playing in the event for the 12th time in two years, but was sent off by captain Jim Fury in the Saturday fourball and foursome modes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has been so many times for the United States, the five-time major champion divided his day between cheering and working on the field, hoping to correct what was hurting him.
He was never the most direct of drivers, even in the prime of his career, and the 48-year-old is not the best choice for the competitive dynamic of Le Golf National, where the toughest players take over from the losers.
And if the field itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson, in game nine on Sunday, will face British Open champion Francesco Molina, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood for the four-game win streak this week.
If the Americans, who are starting their 12th straight game four points below, can get off to a good start, Mickelson's game could be a decisive one.
Fury was so confident in his man that he could not say much more.
"He understood his role today so well, he gave me a little pat on the back and said he'd be ready tomorrow", Fury said.
"She's very self-confident.
He's a great athlete and he's done a great job for these teams in the past and this week.
I probably wouldn't watch two games.
I was hoping for more, but it happened, and we felt like we had to do it.
He just wants to be there, like everybody else".
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
This may mark the end of his professional Ryder Cup career, which he never again reached his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 18 losses, and 7 no-hitters, but according to Fury, he brought something untouchable to the team.
"He's funny, and sarcastic and intelligent, and he's always making jokes with people, and it's great to have him around", she said.
"The young players have really enjoyed playing against him this week, and it's been fun to watch.
She does a lot more than play".
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that the huge advantage they have can fade in a matter of minutes.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that despite a strong lead in the final round of the singles, the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an awkward situation.
The Danish made his debut in Valderrama in 1997, where his team under Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but narrowly won the championship with a score of 141⁄2 to 131⁄2.
"I constantly remind myself that we had a big lead in Valderrama and we barely won, and we lost in Brooklyn even though we had a big lead", said Bjorn (pictured), after Class of 2018 won 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, taking a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
So, what history tells me and everyone in the team is that this isn't over yet.
We'll be on the alert tomorrow.
We're gonna go out there and try to do everything right.
Nothing's decided until I get the points on the board.
Winning the trophy is our goal, and that's what we're focused on.
As I've always said, I'm focused on the 12 players on our side, but we know what's on the other side: some of the best players in the world".
Exulting over the achievements of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn even said, "I never try to get ahead of anything.
Tomorrow is tomorrow.
We're in the singles tomorrow, which is another thing.
It's great to have a partner when things are going well, but when you're alone, every golfer has to showcase their full potential.
That's the message we want to give our players. Get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you forget about your friends, because they're all trying to get their best".
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Fury of his opponent's team is confident that all of his players will be better than they are as individual members, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have scored three of the four points.
Fury himself was on both sides of these last-day turnarounds, as part of the winning team in Brooklyn and later losing to the European team when the Europeans did what they call the "Miracle of Medina".
"I remember every word he said", he said when asked how Ben Crenshawk, the 1999 captain, cheered the players on their final day.
"We have 12 big games tomorrow, but we're all about keeping our lead from the start, like we did in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the other side has the upper hand, there's a lot of pressure in those mid-game games.
We decided on that roster, and we think we're going to do a great job tomorrow".
Thomas is in charge of the counterattack, and Rory McIlroy will be his opponent in the final match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as fellow Europeans in the upper midfield.
"I chose that group in that order because they're in a position to go all the way", said Bjorn of the individuals he chose.
The construction of the new German battleship has been delayed again.
The new frigate was due to be ordered by the German Navy in 2014 to replace aging Cold War-era warships, but will not be built until at least the following year due to faulty systems and rising costs, according to local media.
The order for the battleship "Rheinland-Pfalz" (the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates) has been delayed until the first half of 2019, Die Zeit newspaper reported, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was due to enter the navy in 2014, but eleven problems after delivery have prevented the completion of this ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the older Bremen-class frigates.
It is likely to have a powerful gun, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missile characteristics, and technology for conducting stealth operations (e.g., reduced radar, and infrared and acoustic signatures).
In addition, she will have longer maintenance capacities: the newest frigates can stay out of their original ports for up to two years.
However, due to continuous delays, these state-of-the-art warships (which Germany aims to project its power) will be obsolete by the time they enter service, Die Zeit reports.
The ill-fated F125 frigate caused a sensation in the media last year as the German Army officially declined the order for the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had ever sent a ship back to the shipyard after it was delivered.
The reasons for the withdrawal are unknown, but the German media reported "serious software and hardware flaws" that made the warship unusable for combat missions.
Software flaws were particularly important, the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by 120 sailors, which is half the number currently operating on Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, the ship is overweight and as a result, its performance is greatly reduced, making it more difficult for the navy to add innovations in the future.
The 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz weighs twice as much as the similar class of German ships used in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project (including training of the crew) is also a problem.
It is reported to have reached €3.1 billion, out of the €2.200 it was originally supposed to cost.
The problems with the new frigates are compounded by the threat of a declining German Navy.
A few months ago, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliamentary defence committee, admitted that the navy's useful ships were running out of fuel.
The delegate said the problem was exacerbated by the fact that the old ships were retired and no new ones were available.
He regretted that not a single Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigate had entered the navy.
The secret life of bats has been discovered by the National Trust.
A new study has been done on a plot in the mountains of Scotland to learn how bats use the landscape to find food.
They expect to gain more information about the behavior of these unusual flying mammals so that they can better define future protective activities.
Research by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland (NTS) will follow common dwarf and soprano bats, as well as the big-eared and Daubenton bat, in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be installed at key locations to monitor the bat's activity throughout the season.
The UK's National Health Service (NHS) staff will also be conducting mobile drilling with handheld sensors.
When the experts analyze the sound of all the recorders, they'll know how often the bats are calling and what each species is doing.
A habitat map and report will then be made to obtain a detailed landscape-scale picture of the bats' behavior.
According to Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant at NTS, the project will determine the most important areas of bats' habitat, as well as how each species uses them.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the formation of grasses, and how best to maintain forests for bats and related species.
The bat populations in Scotland and throughout the UK have declined dramatically over the last century.
They are under threat from construction and development, which affects their nesting and habitat loss.
And the fact that we have a lot of people who are not in the same boat as us, and we have a lot of people who are in the same boat, and we have a lot of people who are in the same boat.
Bats aren't really blind.
But since they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to prey.
They use a sophisticated echo tracking technique to detect bugs and obstacles in the flight path.
NTS is responsible for 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres in Scotland, and takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts who regularly conduct observations, inspections of nets and, occasionally, rescue operations.
In fact, the organisation has created Scotland's first and only bat reserve in the Threave parcel of Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
According to the property manager, David Thompson, the property is the perfect location for them.
"We have a great bat area in Threaven", he said.
"We have old buildings and trees that are very old, and it's a very good habitat.
But there's still a lot we don't know about bats, so through the work we're doing here and on other sites, we're going to understand what they need to stay healthy".
Thompson has noted that it is very important to check for bats before any maintenance work is done on the property; for accidentally destroying a single maternity nest could result in the death of 400 female and young bats, and possibly the extinction of the entire local population.
And the fact that bats are protected species makes it illegal to kill, stalk or harass them, or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, representative of the Bat Protection Association, is appealing to the general population for help.
He said, "We still have a lot to learn about bats, and we don't know how many of the species that live with us survive".
Ronaldo has dropped charges of rape as his lawyers rush to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has said that the rape allegations against him are "fake news" and that those who did it using his name "just want publicity".
They're preparing to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which his lawyer sued.
The Portuguese and Juventus striker is accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in Las Vegas in 2009.
After that, he allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep the incident quiet, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Hours after the accusation was released, he made a live video on Instagram for the 33-year-old Ronaldo's 142 million followers on the platform, in which he called the accusations "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, and no.
"What I said today is fake news", said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner.
They want my name to be public.
It's only natural.
They're trying to make a name for themselves by saying my name, which is not what happens in my profession.
I'm a happy man, and everything's fine", said the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sell Der Spiegel in the face of accusations that it is "an unacceptable publication about alleged privacy violations".
"His lawyer, Christian Schertz, said the player will seek compensation "in light of the seriousness of the violation, "which is one of the worst violations of personal rights in years".
The alleged incident occurred in June of 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's bedroom where he allegedly raped her anal, according to court documents from Clark County, Nevada.
"Mayorga said Ronaldo got down on one knee after the alleged incident and said 99 percent he was a good man, but one percent he was wrong".
According to the documents, Ronaldo admitted to the couple that they had sex, but that it was done with their consent.
Mayorda also said that she had gone to the police, photographed her injuries in the hospital, but later reached an out-of-court settlement, because she was "very afraid of reprisals" and "afraid of being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman said she was considering withdrawing her agreement because she was still traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was on his way to a transfer from Manchester United to Real Madrid, who last summer moved to the Italian giants Juve for a reported €100 million.
Brexit: UK will forever regret losing its car manufacturers
Britain will forever regret giving up its leading role in the automotive industry after Brexit, Trade Secretary Greg Clark said.
He also said it was "worrying" that Toyota UK told the BBC that they would stop production at their factory in Burnstone, near Derby, if the UK left the EU without an agreement.
"We need to make a deal", Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker has warned that delays in customs clearance in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnston plant (which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis vehicles) produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, with 90% of them exported to the rest of the European Union.
"We believe that if the UK leaves the EU without an agreement at the end of March, production at our factory will be halted", said Marvin Cook, Managing Director of Toyota in Burnston.
Other UK car manufacturers (such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover) have also expressed concern about how cross-border trade will work if they leave the European Union without an agreement.
BMW, for example, has said that they will close their Mini factory for a month after Brexit.
The biggest concern for car manufacturers is supply chain risks if Brexit goes no deal.
Toyota's production line is state-of-the-art in terms of capacity, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the European Union for on-demand cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29, there could be disruptions at the borders, leading to delays and spare parts shortages.
It would not be possible for Toyota to keep more than a day's worth of inventory at the Derbyshire factory; consequently, production would have to be stopped.
Clark said Theresa May's so-called "Chequers" plan for the future relationship with the European Union is "precisely calibrated to avoid these kinds of customs checks".
"We want the best deal, not just to ensure the momentary success, but to seize this opportunity in the future", she said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"Besides Toyota, other manufacturers have proven the importance of their highly successful supply chains remaining intact".
Toyota has been unable to say how long the production shutdown will be, but has warned that in the long run, additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and result in job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnston for 24 years and is the factory coordinator for the Unite union, said that the members are increasingly concerned: "I have experience that if we lose these jobs, we will never get them back.
A government spokesman said, "We have presented a concrete and credible plan for our future relations with the European Union".
The White House says the Trump-Rosenstein meeting may be postponed again.
The historic meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be delayed another week as the dispute over Brett Kavanaugh's nomination for the Supreme Court continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian influence on the U.S. election, the connection between Trump aides and Russia, and the president's alleged obstruction of justice.
The question of whether Trump's firing of the deputy attorney general would jeopardize Mueller's independence has been a topic of discussion in Washington for the past few months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was considering wearing a hidden microphone to record his conversations with Trump, as well as removing the president from office under Article 25 of the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein has denied the information.
But he still went to the White House last Monday, when reports surfaced that he was resigning.
Instead, he announced that he would meet Trump, who was at the UN headquarters in New York at the time, on Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein, but then postponed the meeting to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation by the FBI into the recent accusations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said, "There's no date set yet; it could be this week, but I would understand a delay for another week, given everything that's going on at the Supreme Court.
We'll see, though; I always like to keep the press informed".
That's a statement that some reporters might disagree with, because Sanders hasn't held a White House press conference since September 10th.
Chris Wallace asked him why he was down.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not that TV reporters were "high-minded", but he said, "I agree they are high-minded".
Then he suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President has a much higher number of question and answer sessions than his predecessors", he said, adding without citing evidence, "We have checked those statistics".
Sanders said they'll continue to hold press conferences, but if the press can ask questions directly to the president of the United States, that's a lot better than asking me.
We try to do that a lot, and you've seen us do that a lot in the last few weeks, and it will replace a press conference when we give the president of the United States a chance to talk".
Trump answers questions regularly when he leaves the White House, when he speaks at open house sessions, and at press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
He doesn't usually do his own press conference.
The possible reason for this was revealed by the President of the United States this week in New York, by his spontaneous and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of a gathering of reporters.
The UK Health Secretary has written a letter to EU staff working in the NHS in Scotland, expressing concerns about Brexit.
The Secretary of State for Health has written to the European Union staff working in the NHS health system in Scotland to thank them on behalf of the whole country and to ask them to remain after Brexit.
There are less than six months left before the UK leaves the EU, according to a letter from Scottish MP Jeane Freeman.
The Scottish government has already agreed to bear the cost of applying for settled status from EU citizens working in public services.
Freeman said in his letter: "Over the summer, negotiations on Brexit have been progressing between the UK and the EU, and a decision is expected by the autumn.
However, the UK government has stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal exit.
I know this is a very troubled time for all of you.
That's why I want to reassure you that I highly appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of their nationality.
Our partners in the European Union, as well as those outside of it, bring valuable experience and skills, and improve the work of healthcare, to the benefit of patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home without question, and we hope you will stay with us".
Christion Abercrombie was operated on after suffering a severe head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury following a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Tennessee's Mike Organ reports.
According to head coach Rod Reed of Tennessee State, the player suffered a head injury just before halftime.
"He collapsed and passed out on the sidewalk", Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel have been supplying Abercrombie with oxygen right in the band, and have taken him to a stretcher for further medical examination.
A spokesman for the Tennessee State baseball team told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that the team has just been released from surgery and is in the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris said they're not giving any details on the type of injury or its severity yet, and the Tennessee State team is still trying to determine when the injury occurred.
He's in his second year with the Abercrombie Redshirts, and his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He made five tackles before leaving the game on Saturday, making 18 total tackles this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher toll when they buy property in the UK.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher toll on the timber when they buy property in the UK, and the extra amount will be used to help those who have been left homeless, in line with the Conservative Party's plans.
This strategy is intended to neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting younger voters.
In the UK, there will be an increase in the toll on non-taxpayers.
The Treasury estimates this will raise an extra £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher toll on the timing of their property purchases in the UK, and the extra amount will be used to help people who have been left homeless, Theresa May announced today.
This strategy is intended to neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting younger voters by promising affordable housing and higher taxes for those with the highest incomes.
The increase in the tax on the bell will be paid to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional amount collected will be used by the government for its efforts to reduce people sleeping on the street.
The overcharge, which is in addition to the tax on the momentary timbre (including top-level taxes for second homes entered two years ago and for real estate purchased for rent), can reach up to three percent.
The Treasury estimates this will save an extra £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of all properties built in London are bought by non-UK residents; as a result, prices are rising and it is more difficult for first-time buyers to enter the housing market.
The wealthy areas of the country, especially those in the capital, have become "ghost towns" as foreign buyers tend to spend most of their time outside the city.
This new policy comes on the heels of Boris Johnson's call for a reduction in the toll-free tax to help young people buy their first home.
He accuses the big building firms of keeping the prices of land high by buying and leaving it unused, and he asks May to set aside her quota of affordable housing to solve Britain's "housing crisis".
Corbyn, for his part, has introduced a number of attractive housing reforms, including rent control and "unjustified" evictions.
He also wants to give the city more power to build more housing.
May said, "Last year I said I would devote my presidency to restoring the British Dream, and that would be to improve the lives of each new generation.
That means fixing the crappy housing market.
The doors of Britain will always be open to those who wish to live, work and organize their lives there.
However, it is not fair that it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK and for British residents who work hard for foreign companies to buy homes.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become too far away, and the sandy slums of people who have to sleep on the streets are still here".
Jack Ross: "My greatest dream is to coach Scotland".
Jack Ross, manager of Sunderland, says his biggest ambition is to be the coach of the Scotland national team.
The 42-year-old Scot is enjoying the challenge of reviving the North-Eastern club, who are currently third in League One, three points down from first place.
He came to the Stadium of Light this summer after St Mirren were promoted back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I won a B League trophy, and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound programme.
"But I've been watching Scotland's games since I was a kid in Hampden with my dad, and I always wanted to go back.
But I would only have a chance if I had the skills to run the club".
Among those who have coached Sunderland before Ross are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Athletic manager Alloa has said that he did not feel nervous about going after such big names as he had previously turned down coaching offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"To measure success, I have to ask myself, can I get the club back to the Premier League?
"Given the structure and facilities of the club, it should be in the Premier League, without a doubt".
"It's not going to be easy to get there, but I don't consider myself successful if I can't do that".
Ross has only been a coach for three years, serving as assistant manager at Dumbarton for a time and a member of the Hearts coaching staff after 15 months.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third tier, and thanks to him, St Mirren went from being on the verge of relegation to becoming champions the following season.
Ross says he's more comfortable now than when he was at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was a real crossroads for me, maybe", he said of taking over the role of Alla.
"I really thought coaching was the most appropriate role for me, rather than being a player.
It's funny you should say that, because I was a good player, I made a living, and I had some big moments.
But playing it can be tough.
You're dealing with a lot of stuff this week.
I still have to deal with the stress and pressure of work, but I'm comfortable as a coach.
I always wanted to be a coach, and now that I'm doing it, I feel more comfortable in my skin than ever".
The full interview will be broadcast on Sunday 30th September on Sportsound on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 (BST)
A poll found that Saturday 5:30 a.m. is the best time to have a drink.
The summer heat wave has led to a sharp rise in pub revenues across the UK, but the pressure on the restaurant chains is increasing.
Sales of pubs and bar chains rose 2.7%, while those of the larger restaurants fell 4.8%, according to the latest data.
According to Peter Martin of the business consultancy CGA, which collected the data, "As the sun has been shining constantly, and the England team has lasted longer than expected in the World Cup, the data for July are similar to those for June, where pub revenue rose 2.8 percent, but restaurant revenues fell even further.
While restaurant sales in June fell 1.8 percent, they were even worse in July.
Pubs and bars specializing in soft drinks have also had significantly better performance, and the decline in restaurant sales has been greater than their increase.
The pubs that cater to the food industry have also suffered from the sun, but not as much as the restaurants.
Apparently, people just want a drink.
"The sales of drinks in pubs and bars have risen 6.6% in the last month, while food sales have fallen 3%.
Paul Newman, a leisure and hospitality analyst at RSM, said: "These results are a continuation of the trend we've seen since late April.
The influence of weather and social and sporting events are the most important factors in terms of outdoor retail sales.
It's not surprising that restaurant chains are struggling financially, and a 4.8 percent drop in sales from year to year is expected to cause significant losses, in addition to continued cost pressure.
The long, hot summer is coming at a perfect time for catering establishments, and it remains to be seen if the moderate August temperatures will provide any relief".
Sales of pubs and restaurants, including newly opened establishments, rose 2.7 percent in July as chain expansion slowed.
The Coffer Peach Tracker index tracks sector sales for pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK by collecting and analysing performance data from 47 operators' groups, which together have revenues of over £9 billion.
One in five kids have social media accounts that they're hiding from their parents.
One in five children, some as young as 11, have social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, a recent survey found.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in fake Instagram accounts.
This news has raised fears that she might be posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students say they have a senior account that their parents can see.
But one in five children (some as young as 11) have social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found a significant increase in fake Instagram accounts (Instagram is a photo sharing website).
This news has raised fears that she may be posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of my students say they have a clear boss account that their parents can see, but they also have private accounts.
A mother accidentally stumbled upon her 13-year-old daughter's secret website where a teenager was telling others to "rape me".
This study, conducted by the UK company Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' Conference of Independent Schools (HMC), found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds have two profiles, and half of them admit to having private accounts.
According to HMC chairman Mike Buchanan, "It is a cause for concern that teenagers are tempted to create online secret spaces that parents and teachers cannot find".
Eilidh Doyle is to be the new athletic spokesperson for the Scottish Athletics Board.
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed as the new chief executive of the Scottish Athletics Board at the board's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete, and Director Ian Beattie says this change gives the sport's broadcasters a great opportunity to benefit from the vast experience he has built over the last decade on the international stage.
"Eilidh is extremely respected in the athletics community in Scotland, the UK and worldwide, and we know that it will be a great asset to Scottish athletics to have her on the committee", said Beatty.
Doyle said this: "I am eager to be the athlete's spokesperson and I hope to make a significant contribution to the development of sport in Scotland".
The American was the winner of the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, with a total of four gold medals, is now a BBC anchor, and recently lost the ability to walk due to a transient ischemic heart attack.
He tweeted this: "A month ago, I had a heart attack.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said they were going to see if I would recover or how far.
It was really hard, but I've fully recovered, so I had to learn to walk again, so I've been doing some skill exercises today!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages you've been sending me!"
An ad for a milk-pulling machine that compares mothers to cows has generated mixed reactions on the Internet.
A company that produces milk extracts has generated conflicting reviews on the Internet comparing it to cows milked by breastfed cows.
To introduce what is claimed to be the world's first portable silent milk extractor, consumer technology company Elvie has released a humorous ad inspired by a music video to show the freedom the new device gives to mothers who are sucking milk.
Four women who are really mothers dance in a haystack, under a song that has lyrics like, "Yes, I milk myself, but I don't have any glue", and "You may not have noticed, but these aren't rapids, these are my tits".
And the slogan is, "Take the milk, take the milk, give the babies, take the milk, take the milk, I'm milking my girls".
However, this advert posted by the company on its Facebook page has sparked controversy on the Internet.
With over 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has generated mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom say that she doesn't take the "horrors" of the dairy industry seriously.
"It was a very bad decision to use cows for advertising this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but they steal their young within days of birth", one user said.
Elvie's milk extractor can be inserted into one of the breast-feeding bras discreetly (Elvie/Mother)
Someone else said, "Very traumatic for the mother and the puppy.
But, anyway, why not use it as a commercial for a weaning machine for mothers who don't wean?"
Someone else added, "This ad is not polite".
"Some people defended the ad, but one woman said she thought it was "laughing".
"I think it's a great idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd buy myself one.
When I was sucking, I felt like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but that's what it's for.
It's a great product", one user wrote.
Another commented: "It's a funny ad, aimed at mothers who suckle (often in workplaces or toilets), because they feel like 'cows'".
There is no intention to praise or criticize the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, the women show us how they've been dancing with a milk-drain on their bra.
The campaign takes into account that many women who milk feel like cows.
But the Elvie extractor is completely silent, with no cables or tubes, and it can be discreetly carried in a baby bra, so you can move it around freely, so you can carry your baby on your arms or walk around.
Ana Balarin, partner and creative director at Mother, commented: "The Elvie milk extractor is a very revolutionary product, and therefore required a bold and provocative presentation.
With this analogy of a milker and a milk cow, we wanted to highlight the process of milking, the challenges that come with it, and also express the freedom that milking brings in a fun, intimate way.
It's not the first time Elvie's milk-picking has drawn attention.
At London Fashion Week, a mother with two children appeared on the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of child migrants have been smuggled into a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of detected immigrant babies has increased sharply recently, despite the roughly identical menstrual controls at the border, partly because of the Trump administration's harsh rhetoric and guidelines, which have made it harder to get babies back to the sponsors.
Until now, undocumented immigrants have been the main sponsors, but now they're afraid to sign up for child protection because they're afraid of losing their ability to stay in the United States.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities said that potential guardians and other adults living in their household would be asked to submit fingerprints, and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albenz, a senior U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, testified before Congress that dozens of people who had been arrested had called for protection for unauthorized arrivals.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Almost 80 percent of the people who sponsor or live with them are in our country illegally, and many of them are foreign criminals.
So we're still tracking them down", Albenz said.
To speed up the processing of the children's case, officials have created a new rule that children must appear in court within a month of being arrested, not 60 days as previously suggested by the shelter staff.
Many of them will be appearing in a video conference call with an immigration judge to apply for their legal status.
If they are deemed unfit to receive medical treatment, they will be deported immediately.
The longer a child spends in a daycare center, the more likely it is that their anxiety and depression will increase, leading to violent outbursts or attempted escape, according to shelter staff and reports to the system in recent months.
Child advocates say these concerns are heightened in large facilities like Tornillo, because of its size, children's problems are more likely to be overlooked.
And they also say that if you send children to camp to prepare emotionally or without time to say goodbye to their friends, the trauma they're already going through may be exacerbated.
Syria has called on the occupying US, French and Turkish forces to withdraw immediately.
At the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegally present on Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and will be treated as "appropriate".
"They must leave the territory immediately and without any conditions", the committee said.
Moualem said that "the war against terrorism in Syria is almost over" and that 360,000 people have been killed in the war since 2011, while millions have been forced to flee their homes.
He said Damascus will continue to fight "the sacred battle" until "all Syrian territory is cleared" of "terrorist groups and illegal foreign presence".
The U.S. has 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish forces who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad and Syrian Arabs.
France has 1,000 troops in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are good for their return, and accused some Western countries of spreading "irrational fear" that encourages refugees to stay outside.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to ensure these returns", he said.
"They are politicizing the humanitarian issue".
The United States and the European Union have announced that they will not assist in the reconstruction of Syria until Assad and the opposition reach a political agreement to end the civil war.
Recently, Russia and Turkey reached an agreement to establish a buffer zone in the last rebel stronghold in Idlib, which UN diplomats believe provides an opportunity to promote political dialogue.
This Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province of three million people.
However, Moualem said the agreement had clear "limits" and stated that the military action would target jihadists, including al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front fighters, who would be "disarmed".
Staffan de Mistura, the UN envoy, hopes that the first meetings of the new assembly will soon be held between members of the government and opposition to begin drafting a post-war constitution and to prepare the way for elections.
Moualem has set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the meeting, saying that the assembly's work must be limited to revising articles of the constitution of un, and warning that no one else should be involved.
Why Trump Should Be Sure to Win a Second Term
According to this logic, Trump will win reelection in 2020 unless (as many Democratic Party viewers likely expect) a impeachment process or scandals bring his presidency to an early end.
That would be the most dramatic end to a presidency!"
So far, the audience doesn't seem tired.
Since 2014, the peak-time viewership of CNN has nearly doubled to 1.05 million, and that of MSNBC has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News, for its part, has 2.4 million viewers in that time slot, up 1.7 million from four years ago, according to Nielsen data. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has the highest viewership on cable television, reaching 3.5 million viewers on the nights before major news events.
"It's like a fire that draws people together because we want to understand what's going on", says Neal Baer, host of ABC's "Designated Survivor", a show about a chief of staff who becomes president after the Capitol is destroyed in an attack.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy scriptwriter and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club", has another theory.
Just before the 2016 election, he was in a taxi in Boston,
The driver told her she would vote for Trump.
Scovell asked him why.
"Because it made her laugh", said Scovell.
Even in chaos there is time for entertainment.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the stories coming from Washington are about the future of abortion law, the possibility of immigrant families being reunited, and deciding the health of the global economy.
Only privileged viewers can turn off the lights.
However, it goes beyond being informed if you spend six hours watching an expert debate on a wide range of topics, from how Bob Woodward used "deep precedents" to write his book Fear, to Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich skin jacket (a suit full of debris according to The Washington Post), and Stormy Daniels's bizarre description of Trump's anatomy.
I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, says of the Trump show's changing character and arguments (debating the national football league, praising Kim Jong-un): "It gives you the feeling of being a reality show, because it gives you something to consume every day.
You can't miss a piece, or you'll get left behind.
When I met Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees and it was sunny in his house on the northern coast of Kaua'i, but he was locked in the house watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He couldn't get away from the TV, especially now that Brett Kavanaugh has to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court hangs in the balance.
"When I used to do these funny TV shows, people said it was the end of Western civilization", Fleiss told me.
I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right.

Foreign money is pouring into the most equal midterm election in the history of the United States Congress.
It's no surprise to hear about the money pouring into Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District, which has been reorganized in congressional districts, leaving two incumbents vying for the same seat.
This recently redrawn district in the Pittsburgh area is represented by Democratic Congressman Conor Lamb, who won his seat in a special election in another district.
Lamb's other main rival is Republican Keith Rothfus, who represents Pennsylvania's 12th district, which overlaps with the 17th district.
In January, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the district boundaries had been manipulated in violation of what the Constitution says in favor of the Republicans.
This competition in the new 17th district has led to close competition for campaign funding in the major party funding sources: the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after narrowly winning the special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district in March.
The seat had been held by a Republican for the last decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by a 20-point margin, too.
According to some political commentators, the Democrats have a slight advantage.
The United States considered sanctioning El Salvador for its support of China, but later reversed its decision.
Diplomats say that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, but Washington has barely asked them to back down.
Trump had a cordial meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and owned a hotel in Panama until partners decided to fire the management team of the Trump Organization.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, following the recent decision to withdraw recognition of Taiwan, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
However, sanctions were considered only against El Salvador, which received $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, among other things to control drug trafficking, promote development and aid the economy.
The proposed sanctions include a reduction in economic aid and voluntary visa restrictions, which would be very damaging to the Central American country, given its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, officials in North America and Central America delayed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, intended to be a follow-up to a similar meeting held the previous year, and was considered a breakthrough in efforts to prevent immigrants from fleeing to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made clear their intention to hold a conference, and thus announced that consideration of imposing sanctions on El Salvador had been cancelled.
Vice President Mike Pence is expected to attend the conference, which has been moved to mid-October, a sign of the administration's seriousness with the summit, diplomats say.
Three US envoys have been smuggled back to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without warning or severe punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman in Bolton's office declined to comment on details of the three US officials' discussions, including two diplomats who agreed to cover internal discussions in exchange for anonymity.
The report was confirmed by an analyst with close ties to the administration who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learn the history
The report from the Attorney General Robert Mueller on whether Trump may have obstructed justice is due to be released soon, as evidenced by the overwhelming evidence in the public eye.
Mueller is also reportedly investigating whether Russia helped the Trump campaign in its attack on the U.S. election.
If the majority in Congress changes sides, Trump will have to give him instructions as he prepares to appear before voters again (and perhaps someday a jury of his peers).
There are many conditions for that, however, and I'm not talking about the inevitable collapse of Trump or his European counterpart.
Decisions must be made on both sides of the Atlantic that will determine how long this conflict will last.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to stage a coup against Hitler, if the Western powers had supported him and the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and we lost the chance to prevent years of further slaughter.
History is full of such tipping points that either accelerate or delay the inevitable progress of democracy.
The American people are facing a lot of these tipping points right now.
What if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is the one who is controlling the course of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's job has been in jeopardy since this paper reported last year that he suggested a secret filming of the president, and that the president was unfit for office.
Rosenstein says the Times report is incorrect.
"How do we respond when the full and fair investigation that has just been ordered of Brett Kavanaugh by the FBI is not complete or fair, or when he is confirmed as a Supreme Court justice despite credible accusations of sexual harassment and perjury?
And most importantly, will we vote in the midterm elections to form a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, it will be a dark winter for democracy.
However, I really believe we can overcome them, based on the lesson I had in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia, deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the area where my embassy is located.
He survived, he immigrated to the United States, and, 60 years later, he asked me to light a Sabbath candle on his desk with a swastika drawn on it.
With all that inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is feeling positive about his match against Rapid Vienna.
Rapid Vienna are hosting Rangers on Thursday, who know that if they beat the Austrians after their thrilling draw with Villarreal Spain a few weeks ago, they will be in a perfect position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
Midfielder Graham Dorrans was unable to make his first appearance of the season due to a knee injury until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that as a springboard to better things.
"It was a good result, because Villarreal is a good opponent", said the 31-year-old.
"We played for something, and we ended up getting a point.
We might have had a chance to win in the end zone, but maybe it's a draw.
In the first half, they dominated, but in the second half, we dominated.
Thursday night is a big night for the European Championship.
We hope to get three points, but it will be difficult, considering they had a good result in the last game, but the fans are on our side, and I'm confident we'll go ahead and get a positive result.
Last year was tough, with injuries and some changes at the club, but right now, there's a positive atmosphere.
It's a good team and the guys are having a great time and the training is going well.
I believe we can move forward, forget about the past season and succeed".
Women are deeply concerned about their retirement savings.
The people in the survey knew what kind of care they wanted, but very few reported it to their family members.
Half of the people in the Nationwide survey said they'd discussed the cost of long-term care with their partner.
Only 10 percent have talked about it with their children.
"We want a family member to wait for us, but we don't dare ask", said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide Insurance.
Here are the first steps.
Talk to your husband, your wife, your children, the family won't be willing to take care of you unless you ask them first.
You should work with a counselor and your family to agree on where and how you would like to receive care, as the cost of care will depend on these choices.
Ask for help from a counselor who can help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
You have several options for financing long-term care, including a traditional long-term care insurance, a hybrid insurance that allows you to pay for care in cash, and an insurance that you can pay for instantly with your own money, if you have the money.
Clean up the legal paperwork, forget the legal conflicts.
Choose a person you trust to take care of your health, but also make sure you are treated the way you want if you are unable to ask a professional to.
You can also get an attorney to take care of your finances.
You want to hire someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and, when you're unable to, to make sure you pay your bills.
Don't forget the little details: say you have elderly parents, and one of them has a medical emergency, and he's on his way to the hospital.
Do you think you could answer any questions about medications or allergies?
Write down those details so you can have a written plan.
"The finances are at stake, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What are her medications?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?

Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials say the death toll may rise.
Due to the disruption of communication systems, rescue workers were unable to obtain information from the Donggala government, which is the area closest to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, north of Palu.
Please, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated since the disaster.
Here is important information about the city of Palu on Sulawesi Island and the Donggala government:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi island; in 2017, it had a population of about 379,800.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala, on the other hand, is a government area covering over 300 km (180 mi) that forms the northwestern coast of Sulawesi island.
The government, which is the administrative region under the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
The economy of Central Sulawesi province is based on fishing and agriculture, particularly in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickela mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowal, on the other side of Sulawesi's coast.
According to the Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management, the Paluk and Donggala have been hit by numerous tsunamis in the last 100 years.
In 1938, over 200 people were killed and hundreds of homes destroyed in a tsunami in Donggala.
In 1996, another tsunami struck in the west of Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, which is often affected by earthquakes.
Here are the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a major earthquake struck the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, north of Sumatra, and caused a tsunami that shook 14 countries, causing 226,000 deaths along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half in Aceh.
2005: Between late March and early April, a series of powerful earthquakes occurred off the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck south of Java (Indonesia's most populous island), causing a tsunami that devastated the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of the South Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude-7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres in height, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A small earthquake struck the Aceh Pidie Jaya governorate, bringing devastation and fear as people recalled the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami then, but over 100 people died when the buildings collapsed.
2018: A series of major earthquakes struck the popular tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing over 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed hundreds of buildings, and for a time many tourists were stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son has been arrested on domestic violence charges.
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and current Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, a native of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of justice and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a woman he knew started calling the police to report a suspected crime, Palin took her phone away.
According to KTUU, Mat-Su is currently in the Palin Pre-Trial Facility under a $500 bail.
On the Sabbath they went to the court and asked, "Is there any charge against us?"
Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanor counts, which carries a maximum sentence of one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He's also charged with a Class B misdemeanor punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin's been accused of a crime.
In December 2017, his father, Todd Palin, was charged with assault.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported a suspected assault.
As we speak, the case is pending before the Alaska Supreme Court.
In January 2016, she was charged with domestic assault, obstruction of justice for a domestic violence offense, and possession of a firearm while intoxicated.
His girlfriend testified that he was slapped in the face.
When her son's aggressive behavior was linked to post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his experiences in Iraq, Sarah Palin received harsh criticism in 2016.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have been killed after a massive earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami, destroying thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are cut off, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck the central Sulawesi, which is northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
Several videos are circulating on social media showing the moment of impact.
In fact, there was a beach festival in the city of Palu, where hundreds of people were there when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors want a special death sentence for a suspect in the New York terrorist attack.
The federal prosecutor in New York wants the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people. The last time the state imposed such a death sentence on a federal crime was in 1953.
It is alleged that 30-year-old Saipov used a truck rented from Home Depot for the attack on the West Side Highway in South Manhattan; in that October attack, he took out all pedestrians and cyclists in front of him.
To justify the death sentence, the prosecution must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight and "intentionally" injured several people, according to the death penalty intent notice filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the legal documents, in both cases, the death penalty is possible.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in connection with organized crime, which the federal prosecution typically uses to try organized crime cases, and one count of assault and destruction with a motor vehicle.
The prosecution said the attack must have been premeditated and planned, as Saipov described it as "cruel".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov's actions caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of the following persons: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, according to the letter of intent.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last heard a death penalty case.
Then, defendant Khalid Barnes was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a federal case in New York was sentenced to death was in 1953, when it was imposed on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were charged with conspiracy to commit espionage against the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were sentenced to the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to official documents, Saipov, the Uzbek, showed no sign of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
Police said he had not told investigators he felt bad about his actions.
According to the report, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by seeing a video of ISIS on his mobile phone.
The police also said that he demanded that the ISIS flag be hung in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders who is representing Saipov, said they were "deeply disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We feel that our decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea for life without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma to the people affected by these events", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team asked the prosecutor not to try to impose a death sentence.
A Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farag ordered the mobilisation of the People's Army to protest the Conservative Party conference today.
The former UKIP leader has said that politicians should feel the heat of the Eurosceptics, and Theresa May's MPs have proposed it as a way to handle the Brexit negotiations.
Conservative MP Peter Bone has told the Birmingham marchers that the UK would be "out" if Mr Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But pro-Remain Conservatives have staged an anti-Brexit rally in the city, highlighting the challenge ahead for Mrs May to reconcile the deeply divided ranks.
The Prime Minister is working hard to get the Chequers compromise plan through, but it's been met with heavy criticism from Brexit supporters, Remain supporters and the UK.
The Allies expect that he will go ahead and try to reach an agreement with Brussels that will ignore such reactions and force the Eurosceptics and farmers to choose between his offer or "chaos".
Mr Bone told the Leave Means Leave protest in Solihull that he wanted the Chequers fired.
He also said he would work closely with Mr. Farage and be entrusted with the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was responsible, we'd be out of here by now", he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I will support Brexit, but we must fire Chequers".
Expressing opposition to the British, he said: "We did not fight in the world wars to serve anyone.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bone denies that the idea that public opinion has changed since the 2016 election that the British have changed their minds and want to remain is a lie.
The Conservative Party member and Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march, explaining to reporters: "I'm just saying this: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is unknown to the public, the opposition will not vote for him, he is unknown to our party members, not even to our activists who are rocking the streets and making it possible for us to win the election.
Put down the Chequers and start listening.
Addressing Mrs May, he added: "Prime Ministers, to keep their jobs, must keep their word.
Mr Farage told the demonstrators that politicians must be made to feel "hot" if they are to betray the decision they made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now, this is a matter of trust between us and our political class", he said.
They're trying to cheat us out of the Brexit deal, and we're here today to let them know that we're not going to let them get away with it.
Addressing an enthusiastic audience, she added: "I want you to warm up our political class who are about to betray Brexit.
We are mobilising the army of the people who won us the Brexit, and we will not rest until the UK becomes independent, self-governing and proud.
Meanwhile, supporters of staying marched through Birmingham before a two-hour march through the city centre.
A few activists held up anti-Brexit banners after a group lunch this weekend.
Lord Adonis, whose partner is a labourer, laughed at the Conservatives at the beginning of the conference about the security problems they had with the party's application.
"These are the people who tell us that they can make ICT systems work properly, and in Ireland he added the whole technology of the Canada plus plus network, frictionless, borderless, free trade without borders".
That's a big lie.
There is no good Brexit, he added.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at a plenary meeting Saturday at the Massachusetts Western City Hall.
Warren, who is a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is expected to run for re-election in November against Republican state representative Geoff Diehl; Diehl was Trump's vice chairman of the 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
He's been rumored to be a potential Trump successor in 2020.
The event, which took place in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon, was Trump's 36th meeting with his fellow council members since he took office.
A contestant asked him if he planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that, in order to do that, a woman had to be in charge.
A suspect has been arrested in connection with the shooting that killed Sims at Louisiana State University.
Baton Rouge, Louisiana police announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in connection with a shooting that resulted in the death of Louisiana State University basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a news conference held at 11:00 (Eastern time) the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson.
Earlier, he posted a video of Friday's shooting, asking for help identifying a man who was on it.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed Friday morning outside the South Campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head, which ultimately led to his death", Chief Murphy J. Paul told Saturday's 247sports.
Wayde got into a fight trying to defend a friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned, and he admitted to being there, to having a gun in his hand, and to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and transferred to the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The 6-foot-2 Sims grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 10-star games last season, averaging 17.4 minutes of play, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
The Russian Grand Prix, Lewis Hamilton won the world title thanks to the team's instructions after beating Sebastian Vettel.
It became clear on Saturday, when Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton, that the Mercedes team's decisions would be life and death in the race.
From the start, Bottas performed brilliantly, almost knocking Hamilton out in the first two rounds to defend his place, and inviting his teammate Vettel to attack.
Vettel came into the pits first, and Hamilton had to get into the traffic at the end of the troop, which should have had a direct impact on the race.
The Mercedes entered the pits a lap later, and left behind Vettel, but was overtaken by Hamilton after a qualifying session, in which the Ferrari driver left the interior free to defend the third corner after a double move to hold his position.
Max Verstappen, who was 21 years old that day, started the race on the back row of the grid, finishing the first lap in seventh place.
He then maintained his first place for most of the race, and by the end, he held on to his tyres to finish the race quickly and to overtake Kimi Raikkon and secure fourth place.
He finally entered the boxing ring in the 44th round, but was unable to keep up with the pace in the remaining eight rounds, and Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's not an easy day, but Valtteri has done a great job all weekend, and he's been really honest.
The team did a great job in qualifying, Hamilton said.
Those were inappropriate gestures.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for highlighting the fact that he did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
When addressing a demonstration in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee; instead, he said that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "evil, false and liars".
"The only thing that could happen, and the beautiful thing that's been happening in the Senate these last few days, is you see the anger, you see people who are angry, you see people who are evil, fake, and liars", he said.
You see all the publications and leaks and they say, "Oh, it wasn't me".
It wasn't me.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak the letter?
Do you remember what he said when he leaked the letter?
Oh, no, not at all.
I didn't leak it.
Well, wait a minute.
No, we didn't, he added, mimicking the senator's reaction.
The letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein by Ford in July and leaked last September, but Feinstein denies the leak occurred in his office.
"I did not suppress Dr. Ford's claims, nor did I leak his story", Feinstein told the committee, as reported by The Hill.
He asked me to keep it quiet, so I kept it quiet, as he asked.
But his denial was not welcomed by the president, who said the following on Saturday night's demonstration:
Maybe it wasn't her, but those were the most inappropriate gestures I've ever seen.
Following the defense of the Supreme Court nominee who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president said that the Democrats were using the allegations to their advantage.
They're willing to do anything to get back the power.
They are bad, no matter who they hurt, who they have to oppress to gain power and control", the president said, as reported by Mediaite.
The Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants are in the Elite League.
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars recovered on Saturday from their Elite League defeat to Belfast Giants on Friday, having won 5-3 in the second-round match played in Dundee.
The Giants opened the scoring with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought a tie, but the Giants quickly regained the lead.
Francois Bouchard brought the tie back to Dundee, and in the end, the two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen ensured him victory.
This was the third defeat in the Elite League this season for Adam Keefe's boys, who lost 2-1 to Dundee in Belfast.
It was the fourth meeting between the two teams this season, and the Giants won their final three games.
Dwyer's opener came in the fourth minute, 3:35, with a save from Kendall McFaull, and four minutes later, David Rutherford assisted Beauvillier, who doubled the score.
It was a rough start, as Sullivan brought the tie in at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt helped Cownie score a goal at 15:16.
Dwyer struggled to make sure the Giants got the scorer in his favor into the first half, and, late in the first half, he scored his second goal of the night.
But the hosts rearranged and Bouchard brought the tie back with a goal in 27:37.
Late in the second half, Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen and give Dundee the lead in the game for the first time, and in the penultimate inning, they brought the team a fifth goal and with it, the win.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play their home game against Milton Keynes on Friday.
An air traffic controller has died trying to help hundreds of passengers escape a devastating earthquake.
An Indonesian air traffic controller has become a hero after he died trying to ensure the proper takeoff of a plane carrying hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people are reported dead and many more missing after a massive earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and caused a tsunami.
Several strong aftershocks have occurred in the area, many of which are trapped under the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues left to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post and leave the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu airport.
Instead, he stayed there to ensure the proper take-off of Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time.
Next, she jumped off the control tower when she saw it was about to collapse.
He died a few minutes later in the hospital.
Indonesian Air Force spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
So we set up a helicopter in Balipappan to take him to a bigger hospital in another city in Kalimantan.
Unfortunately, he left this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are broken to hear that", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could rise to thousands, and the Indonesian Disaster Management Bureau announced restrictions on access to the villages of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The rate is expected to rise further as many bodies are still under the rubble, and many more are still not accessible", said the spokesman for the Bureau, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Palu was completely destroyed by waves of up to six meters, and a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are delivering aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, the 35-year-old mother of the child, told Sky News: Every minute, an ambulance full of bodies arrives.
Clean water is scarce.
People are stealing all the food from the small markets.
Jan Gelfand, head of the Indonesian International Red Cross, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working as quickly as possible to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find.
This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palua on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready? " was released by CNN.
This year, another earthquake struck Indonesia in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now reports a man is missing after a plane crashed into a lake in Micronesia.
The airline that operated the plane that crashed into a Pacific lake in Micronesia now reports one man missing after it was reported that all 47 passengers and crew had been evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that it was only on Saturday afternoon that it could confirm that a male passenger was missing.
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to reporters who asked for more details about the passenger (such as age or nationality).
Local boats were able to rescue the remaining passengers and crew as the plane crashed into the water as it was about to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
Officers said Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the US military said the plane crashed into a lake near the runway.
Several witnesses believe the plane crashed off the runway.
According to passenger Bill Jaynes, the plane landed very low.
"That's a great thing", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers were able to easily reach the emergency exit of the sinking plane in water up to their waists.
She said the waitresses were scared and had a fight and she had a slight head injury.
The U.S. Army said the assistance of fishermen working on improvements to the dock nearby was also very helpful in the rescue efforts; for this, a inflatable boat was used to bring passengers ashore before the plane sank 30 meters (100 feet) in the water.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in crashes involving airlines registered in PNG over the past two decades, but none were caused by Air Niugini.
An analyst has compiled a chronology of the night a woman was burned alive.
The prosecutor delayed the case until Saturday as part of a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Rowlett, of the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of mental analysis.
He told the jury that he used cell phone records to link the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she was killed.
Rowlett claimed that he had received location data from several cell phones showing that the woman was with Tellis Chambers the night she died, thus contradicting Tellis' earlier statement, according to The Clarion Ledger.
The records showed that Tellis' cell phone was with Chambers's at the time that Tellis said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, and Sanford was called in by the police.
Sanford appeared before the judge on Saturday and testified that he was out of town that day.
When the prosecution asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he said he was in the truck in Sanford that night, Sanford said he was "lying", because the truck was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said she had met Chambers for two weeks when he died.
But according to his cell phone records, they'd only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted all of Chambers's text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"It wiped him out", Hale said.
The defense will begin the final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said the jury will hear the case later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio that's going to challenge people who have negative opinions about this kind of music, and they're going to do that by filling their music with a positive message.
The Bristol-based band The High Breed say hip-hop music has moved away from its early political messages and social struggles.
They want to go back to their roots and make hip-hop conscious again.
Some artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have seen a resurgence of this type of hip-hop in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another nigger?
A New York babysitter sued a couple for firing her after a racist post.
A New York nanny sued a couple for discriminating against her and firing her after she received a text from her mother saying she was "just another black person" for a mistake she didn't make.
The couple has denied any racist activity, citing the allegation as "exaggerated".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was shocked to learn that the new employee who was supposed to be babysitting the children, Giselle Maurice, was black when Maurice arrived home on his first day at work in 2016.
"Eeeee, another bell", wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice, and she sent it twice.
According to the New York Post, when he learned of the mistake, he reportedly felt "uncomfortable" with Plasco-Flaxman, and fired Miss Maurice, the previous nanny, who was African-American, saying she was not a good worker and wanted a Filipino nanny instead.
He paid Miss Maurice for that one day's work and borrowed an Uber to take her home.
Now, Maurice sues the couple, seeking damages for the dismissal, including $350 a day for six months, after he was initially hired to live in the house and take care of her for six months, despite not having a contract.
"I want to show them that these things don't happen", she told the Post on Friday, adding: "I know it's discrimination".
The couple denied any racist behavior and said that Maurice's firing was reasonable and necessary, because they feared they would no longer be able to trust him after his outrageous behavior.
My wife sent him something she didn't want to tell him.
He's not a racist.
We are not racists", Joel Plasco told the Post.
But would you trust your own children to someone you have offended, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Not a chance.
While explaining that the allegation was "not serious", Plasco said that his wife had barely had a baby for two months and that his condition was "difficult".
You're gonna be looking for someone with that attitude?
That's not good behavior, your investment banker added.
The legal case is still ongoing, and a court of public opinion has quickly indicted the couple on social media, punishing them for their behavior and logic.
The publishers of Paddington were afraid that readers would not like a talking bear, a new letter showed.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after receiving the book, had this to say about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It's very interesting to know what we know about the success of Paddington.
His father was a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write a children's book by a small toy bear; his daughter said that his father was positive despite the fact that people rejected his work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication had a "sweet-bloody" taste, as he died last year.
As for Paddington, she says he was an important member of the "family", and that his father was proud of his ultimate success.
"He was a quiet man, not a pretentious one", she said.
But Paddington was so real to her, it was almost like her son had accomplished something, and you're proud of him, even though it wasn't your achievement.
And I think that's how she saw success in Paddington.
Although it was a creation of his own imagination, he always credited Paddington with the credit.
My daughter was dying, so I had to call her.
Immediately after landing, she was rushed to the Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, but the doctors could not do anything to save her life.
"Nad called periodically to say it was urgent, that he didn't think he could get out", said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
And then I got a call from Nad saying that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll see you in a minute.
I'll be with you.
The medication the doctors prescribed to keep her heart beating was wearing off and was leaving her system slowly.
He died a few hours earlier than I thought, and that's it.
I could only sit and wait, knowing that it would all begin.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by family and people.
I had to hold him off.
Finally, Madame Ednan-Laperouse, who was now haunted by the death of her daughter, boarded the plane with the rest of the passengers, having forgotten her grief.
"No one knew", he said.
I was bowing my head, and tears were coming down all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight, I felt sorry for Nad.
He just needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved it.
Some angry women have put up signs on a bridge to stop people from committing suicide.
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide and want to stop more people from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have put up signs on a bridge in Wales with positive messages and phone numbers to tell people to call for help.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he started having depressive problems, and he committed suicide when he was 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I have to feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, a 45-year-old resident of Lydney, said her son had a gift for cooking and a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said her smile would light up anything.
However, he resigned before his death, as he was in a very dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found him after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said this: "I'm constantly worried about what might be a domino effect".
Mrs. Davis once made a poster for a group of people to let people know that there are people you can tell about what's going on and that they can help you, even if it's a friend.
Don't just stand there, you have to talk.
Mrs. Humphreys and Mrs. Davies have been friends for a long time, and she herself became his partner for 15 years shortly after the death of Mark's mother, who lost her.
"She didn't say she was sad or depressed", she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
She was so upset on Christmas Day when the kids opened their presents, she didn't even look at them.
She said that her death was a big trauma for them, but they have to move on because it leaves a hole in the family.
It's devastating to us.
But we must all stand up and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is on the line as an FBI investigation begins.
"I thought, if we could get something like what he asked for, like a limited-time study or a limited-area study, maybe we could get some unity", Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid the committee was "setting back" in the face of the disruption caused by the enthusiastic partisans.
Why did they refuse to let the FBI investigate this case by Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters?
The only reason you're not getting a good impression is because of the time.
There are only five weeks left until the midterm elections on November 6th, when the Republicans are expected to lose out, and if they do, they will start the race very weak to get the man they want on the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush made a series of phone calls to the senators, trying to pressure them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens once the FBI does their report?
It's going to be voted on in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are sitting right now.
It's still unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 Senate votes, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and run for the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees has been declining since Kim took power.
The number of people fleeing North Korea for South Korea has been declining since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Reunification Department, said there were 1,127 refugees last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
According to Mr. Park, the effect of the increased border controls between North Korea and China and the increased sanctions on human traffickers has been significant.
Pyongyang has not yet made a public comment.
Almost all North Korean refugees are offered South Korean citizenship sooner or later.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats refugees as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and they are often forcibly repatriated.
North and South Korea are still at war, although relations have improved dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the stalled denuclearization talks.
Earlier in June, a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un took place in Singapore, where they agreed on a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the lack of progress since then on the US sanctions.
"If we don't trust the United States, we won't trust our national security, and, given the situation, we won't lay down our weapons first", Mr. Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi tells Brett Kavanaugh that she's "hysterical" and that she's not ready to be on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh's nomination for Supreme Court "hysterical", and as far as genius goes, she's not ready to be on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview with the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had ever acted like that, they would have called it 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said, in response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denies ever sexually assaulting Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and sometimes he would almost scream and stutter when he talked about his family and his youth.
She also explicitly accused the Democratic Committee, calling the allegations against her "organized and offensive defamation" organized by liberals angry about Hillary Clinton's loss in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh's testimony made it clear that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because he showed a bias against Democrats.
"With these accusations and his attitude toward the Clintons and the Democrats, he's out of the league", he said.
Pelosi objected when asked if Kavanaugh was elected and the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives if she would run against him.
"I'll say this: if she's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then she's not ready to be on the Supreme Court, not on the court that's sitting right now", Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh serves as a judge of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she's concerned about Kavanaugh's decision to veto the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, which is a conservative justice system.
In the courtroom, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"A hysterical, unbiased person cannot go to court and expect us to welcome him", Pelosi said.
And women should lead.
It's a natural speech, a fury of months and years that she can't let go without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", said to me 45 years later, Ms. Steinem.
I don't think it's weird, do you?
She went on to say, "One woman who was a CEO was really helpful, and she told me that she used to cry when she got angry, but she had developed this technique where when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person who was talking to her, 'You can assume I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm pissed off.
And then he just kept going.
And I thought, "That's a great idea".
Tears are not wrong to see as an expression of anger, partly because they are misinterpreted.
I remember something that happened to me very clearly on one of my first jobs -- it was in an office that was mostly men -- and I was crying like a madman one day, and an older woman grabbed me by the neck.
"Never let them see you cry", she said.
They don't know you have rabies.
They think you're sad and they'll feel good because they understood you.
Patricia Schroeder was a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado at the time, and she worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught on a ship called Monkey Business and it was discovered that he was having an affair with a woman other than his wife and he had declined to run, Ms. Schroeder, devastated, decided to run for president with the same woman.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision", she told me laughing 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called them Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
The campaign had been going on for a while, and he was late in the fundraiser, so he decided not to run until he had raised $2 million.
The fight was lost.
She found out that men who gave $1,000 to each of them actually got $250 from some of her fans.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" he asked himself.
When she gave a speech and announced that she was going to stop running an official campaign, she was so moved by her gratitude to the people she supported, her frustration with the system that made it so difficult for her to collect money and voters instead of representatives, and her anger at her sexist attitudes that she finally stammered.
"You'd think I was a little nervous", explained Ms. Schroeder of the press' reaction to her behavior.
You'd think the Kleenex was my protector.
I remember thinking, what will they write on my tombstone?
Did she cry?
The benefits of the US-China trade war for Beijing
The shock waves that marked the start of the US-China trade war were a shock, and while the conflict is still vivid, experts say the rift between the two countries may be in Beijing's long-term advantage.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year when he imposed tariffs on China's main exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant increase came this week, with new tariffs affecting over $200 billion worth of goods, which will apply to half of all goods shipped from China to the US.
Beijing has retaliated in every instance, most recently by raising tariffs of five to 10 percent on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has said they will match any rise of the US, and the world's second largest economy is not going to change its mind so easily.
Asking Washington to back down would mean a lawsuit, but publicly surrendering to the United States would be even more humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
But experts say that if Beijing does well, the US trade war pressure could benefit China in the long run, reducing the dependence between the two economies.
"A hasty decision by politicians in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic turmoil in one of the two countries, which is more dangerous than observers previously thought", said researcher Abigail Grace, who studies Asia at the Center for a New American Security along with several other experts.
Syria is ready to allow refugees to return, the Foreign Ministry says.
Syria says it's ready to allow refugees who want to return voluntarily to return, and is asking for help to rebuild the country after more than seven years of war.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country was improving.
"Today the situation in the region is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the counter-terrorism process", he said.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate areas devastated by terrorists to allow a return to normalcy as soon as possible.
Now, the scenario is that refugees who are willingly trying to return to their countries of origin are forced to leave because of terrorism and economic measures that make their daily lives difficult.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be grateful for help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he made it clear he would not accept any conditional aid from the countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe has been given the victory in the Ryder Cup in Paris.
After beating the USA team by 16.5 points on the final scoreboard with 10.5 points, the European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup cup held at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six straight on European soil and hasn't won a Ryder Cup on European soil since 1993.
Europe won the crown again when the team under Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the USA.
US star Phil Mickelson had a rough time most of the tournament, and threw the starting shot into the water on the 16th hole of the third period, passing the mark to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Milinari stood out a lot in every round, becoming one of only four players to ever reach 5, 0 and 0 results since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth finished 5-4 and was eliminated from the worst player in Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen.
The world's best player Dustin Johnson scored 2-1 against Ian Poulter of the United Kingdom and reached the final of the Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Sergio García, who had participated in eight Ryder Cups, became the leading European winner of the tournament with 25.5 runs scored.
I don't usually cry, but tonight I couldn't help myself.
It's been a tough year.
So she thanks Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, I'm so happy to have my cup back.
This is a team effort, and I'm happy to have been able to contribute, said García, moved after Europe's victory.
He passes the baton to Spaniard John Ram, who defeated American legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in a singles match on Sunday.
"I feel very proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, the man I grew up watching", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France, and now has a record of 13, 21, and 3 in the Ryder Cup.
Strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, only surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team spent the entire weekend trying to find a solution to the difficult situation, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top-quality golf throughout the tournament.
US captain Jim Fury made a comment about the team's poor performance: "I'm proud of my boys for trying.
This morning, we put a little pressure on Europe.
It didn't work.
Hail to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of their players have been great.
I'm gonna meet with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup Committee and we're gonna move on.
I love all 12 of my boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We must accept defeat.
We're out of here.
Red tide news, concentrations are down in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota.

The irregularities are 10 miles outside of Hillsborough County, but in fewer places than last week.
