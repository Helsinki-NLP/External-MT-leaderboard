This not only confirms that at least some of the dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widespread, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as their color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Researchers say that the wings of this animal were brown above with a light or carrot color below.
The finding also provides information on the evolution of the wing in birds.
Because dinosaur wings do not have a fully developed axis, called a spine, but do have other features of the "mustard and mysterious" wings, researchers concluded that the spine was probably a later evolutionary development than the other features.
The structure of the wings suggests that they were not used for flying but for temperature control or for demonstration. Scientists argue that although this is a tail from a young dinosaur, the sample reveals adult feathers and not puppy feathers.
The researchers claim that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen suggests adult feathers, not a newborn.

The Federal Civil Aviation Administration claims that the new generation air transport system would allow aircraft to operate shorter routes, save gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
The technology it uses is satellite in contrast to the older radar-based ground technology to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately locate an aircraft and give more accurate information to pilots.



Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although the process is believed to have lasted much longer, due to breeding between the endemic Darwin's spiny Geospiza fortes and the migratory spiny Geospiza conirostris.

When you call someone who's far away, you use a satellite.
Satellite in space receives the call and then sends it back to earth almost instantaneously.
The satellite was launched by rocket, and the experts have space telescopes because the atmosphere of our planet is causing distortions in our light and visibility.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet to send a satellite or a telescope into space.

Below them are the mid-sized cats feeding on medium-sized prey from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many predatory kittens (including the pet cats that are left free) that hunt the many insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the idea of a position, a special role for each cat, which prevents them from competing with each other.
Lion are the most social of cats, living in large groups called herds.
The herds consist of one to three adult males that mate with each other along with up to thirty females and their young.
The females are usually closely related to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds act much like wolf or dog herds, animals that are strikingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in behavior, and are also extremely deadly to their prey.
The tiger, as an accomplished athlete, can climb (at not a very good level), swim, make huge jumps, and use five times more force than a strong man to lift something.
The tiger belongs to the same genus (genus Pantherina) as the lions, leopards and jaguars.
The tiger's roar is not like the loud roar of a lion, but it is more like a phrase than angry, loud words.
Oselotes prefer small animals. They will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and even birds. Almost all the animals the oselotes hunt are smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that oselots follow and find animals to feed (hunt) through smell, smelling the ground to see where they are.
They see very well in the dark through night vision and move silently. Oselots hunt their prey by adapting to their environment and then by suddenly attacking their prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it came (for example if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return) they will often encounter a different environment than in the past.
This new environment has new sources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor than what was required in the past.

As time goes by, as the new population starts to adapt to the new environment, the similarity to the rest of the population gets smaller and smaller.
Somewhere, after thousands or maybe millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can't be considered the same species.
This process is called iodogenesis, which means the formation of new species.iodogenesis is an inevitable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make the oxygen humans breathe and absorb carbon dioxide humans exhale (i.e., exhale).
Plant life is made from sunlight, photosynthesis, and shade.

Mosasaurus was the leading predator of his time, so he was afraid of nothing except other Mosasaurs.
Long jaws had over 70 razor-sharp teeth combined with an extra set of teeth at the top of its mouth, indicating that there was no exit for anything that passed its way.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a cleft tongue, feeding on turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and he may have been a cannibal.
e attacked anything that entered the water, even the giant dinosaur, Tyrannosaurus, would not be a rival to him.
Though most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans also had various strange or unusual festive dishes, including the following, boar, peacock, snail, and a type of rodent called gilli.
Another difference is that poor men and women ate their food sitting on chairs, whereas rich men preferred to eat at banquets where they could relax on their side while dining.
The meals in ancient Rome couldn't have contained the foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, there was no corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had eaten turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a primitive temple that was considered the house of the god.
The people would sacrifice to the deities and the priesthood would try to meet the desires of the deities by organizing rituals and celebrations.

Sometimes they built specific towers in a pyramidal shape called ziggurats, and they were part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.

So the note might have been added just as a label.
The Normandy landings and the ensuing battles liberated the French North, but the South was still not free.
It was run by the Vichy Government, which was made up of Frenchmen who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and were working with the invaders rather than fighting them.

Within two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated southern France and Germany was on their way.

Congressional power was not to tax, and because there was no executive or judicial power, it relied on non-cooperative state authorities to enforce all laws.

The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended, but the states took over the government so unopposedly that their representatives were often absent.
The national football teams of Italy and Germany are the second most successful teams in the world and were the champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, ice hockey and Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the Nordic countries, with Italians participating in international competitions and Olympic Games events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (Honshu is the largest), making it the 7th largest island in the world!

Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when passing European sailors named the island Ilha Formosa, meaning "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwestern part of Taiwan and began a transformation in the practices by which native grain was produced, employing Chinese workers on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) dominated western and northern Taiwan, making it an administrative province of their empire in 1885.

Most of the buildings in the complex have been built from scratch to give tourists a better idea of what their original appearance was like.
30% of Matsue Pitsue was restored by 1976 and its restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format is 35 mm worldwide, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It's still being produced today, but the most important thing is the proportions of dimensions that have been inherited from the image sensor forms of the digital camera.
35mm is actually 36mm wide, which is confusing, and 24mm tall.
The dimension ratio of this arrangement (divided by twelve to get the simplest ratio of integers) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS format category, for example) are equal to or close to these image ratios.
The rule of three, which is often abused and ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamic while maintaining order down to one meter in an image.
It states that the most effective point for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).


The universe is a place of death and destruction.
One of the main beliefs of Christianity is that wealth should be used to relieve the poor and those who suffer and the funds of the churches are specifically raised for this purpose.
The central authority of the church was based in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led many to question whether the doctrine was being properly implemented.
UK began blocking Germany from the sea immediately after the onslaught began.
The strategy has been effective, as cuts have been made in vital military and civilian supplies, despite the fact that this blockade violated generally accepted international law which has been codified by various international agreements over the last two centuries.
UK has placed mines in international waters to prevent ships from moving anywhere on the sea, threatening even neutral ships.
As there was limited reaction to this tactic, Germany expected the same for its unimpeded submarine warfare.
n the 1920s, the attitude adopted by most citizens and nations was peace and isolation.

In those days, there was a fierce war between many nobles who were vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, as thousands of people lost their lives fighting for the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
The social and political consequences are many and include the use of the metric system, a shift from authoritarianism to democracy, patriotism and the belief that the country does not belong to a single ruler, but to all the people.
also after the revolution the professions were available to all men seeking work, enabling the most ambitious and successful to succeed.

The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class individuals in other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was intensely interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He often visited a cave that became known as Hira on Mount Nur (Light) for meditation.
The cave itself, where he survived the time, provides a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
The cave is far from the world as it is located on the edge of a hill north of Mecca.
actually, it's not easy for someone to find it even if they know it exists. once you get inside the cave, you're in complete isolation.
Nothing is visible beyond the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. Very few things of this world are visible or can be heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders still standing today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century B.C., is one of many large pyramid-shaped structures built in honor of the dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plain, or "Necropolis of Giza" located in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, has several pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Khufu), some small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids in size, as well as the smaller tombs and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wife and family members.
The sign that says the bow should move upwards looks like a V and the sign that says the bow should move downwards looks like a wire or a square that doesn't have a bottom.
Up means you have to start at the edge, pushing the bow, and down means you have to start at the frog (the point where your hand holds the bow) and pull it.
Touch up makes a softer sound, while touch down is louder and more dynamic.
You are free to add your own notes, but keep in mind that the ones that are there perform some musical function, so they often need to be taken into account.

They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people who were screaming and threatening the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the windows of their carriage.
nce, one person from the mob started shaking the head of a member of the royal guard who was killed in Versailles, right before the eyes of the terrified queen.
The expenses of the US imperialist war for the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They had to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover a large part of the costs and the bond rate was stimulated on behalf of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banking houses.

To understand the Knights, one must understand the context that led to the formation of the order.
The time when these events occurred is often referred to as the Late Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1,000-1,300 A.D.).
The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and preceded the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
"Technological rationality" is a term that encompasses a variety of ideas in practice, from the promotion or enforcement of technology, to the strict interpretation that the future of humanity is governed by an underlying logic directly linked to the laws of science and their manifestation in technology.

For example, someone might argue that the car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
The Commission considers that the measures in question constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1) TFEU.
The collective ownership system also leads to higher rates of road accidents, which in turn lead to new methods in health care for the rehabilitation of physical injuries.
Romantism had an important element of cultural determinism, originating from writers such as Goethe, Ficht and Slegel.

The reputation for being a centre of abundance began to spread around 400 CE and lasted until around 1100 CE.

It was then that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Istanbul to Paris.
Gothic reached its heyday between the 10th and 11th centuries, as well as the 14th century.

n the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style.One of the most important developments of the time, which resulted from the Crusades, was that people began to fasten their clothes with buttons.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Survival farming is a simple, usually organic system of using stored seeds from the local ecosystem, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Traditionally, farmers were mostly involved in self-sustaining agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subculture brings together people with similar views who feel marginalized by social norms, giving them the opportunity to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are divided by age, origin, social class, location and/or racial discrimination.
The qualities that make a subculture distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
To mark their identity, members of a subculture often adopt a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes various fashions, particular behaviors, and art.
The main technique for meaningful socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate incidents of children who, due to neglect, misfortune or abuse, did not associate with adults during their lifetime.
Wilderness or wild is the name given to the isolated, or uninhabited, children of a wild child, usually by their parents, who have been abandoned by their parents because of a severe mental or physical disability.
The children in the wild are likely to have experienced severe abuse or traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or before they fled.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are thought to have lived alone in the wild.
A wild child, when raised entirely by animals without having come into contact with humans, exhibits behaviors (within natural limits) that are almost entirely similar to those of the particular animal that has cared for it, such as its fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based teaching makes learning easier and more interesting, aids go a step further.
Worms are not a way to learn but rather a helping hand to people who are subjected to a new learning experience, such as learning a new computer program or starting a new project.
There are virtual and real worms, in other words, the teacher is a form of worm, but the same is true for the human-link in Microsoft Office.
The virtual aids are built into the software and are intended to ask, promote and explain processes which may have been too difficult for students to handle.
Children are placed in the care of foster parents for various reasons ranging from neglect and abuse to even blackmail.
No child should ever be raised in an environment without care, love and education, but it does.
We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these kids.
The current foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education, and affordable health care.
Support is supposed to provide all the needs that the child didn't get in the home he moved away from.
Internet includes elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The special characteristics of the Internet result in additional dimensions in terms of the approach to use and reward.
learning and socializing are considered important motivators for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
personal participation andcontinuous relationships were also identified as aspects of push by Eighmey and McCord (1998) in their research on audience reactions to websites.
Video has made great discoveries in understanding tiny expressions, our expressions that hold infinitesimal.

Oliver Sachs, in his essay entitled The President's Speech, states that individuals who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are, nevertheless, able to distinguish honesty with accuracy.
It is further thought that these abilities to understand human behavior are present in animals such as domestic dogs.
20th century research showed that there are two forms of genetic diversity, latent and expressed.
mutation adds new genetic variants and selection removes them from the pool of expressed variants.
Distinction and mixing redistribute the diversity between the two sides in each family.
Out in the savannah, it's hard for a primitive mammal with a digestive system like ours to satisfy its need for amino acids from available plant resources.
furthermore, their failure in this particular had serious consequences: decline in growth, malnutrition and eventually death.
The most readily available plant resources would be proteins that can attach to leaves and psyllids, but are difficult to assimilate by primitive mammals like us unless they are cooking.
The Commission is proposing to extend the scope of the Directive to include the following:

Sleep interruption is the process of waking up consciously during the normal sleep period and falling back to sleep shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock, so that you can regain consciousness without being fully awake.

Other biorhythm-based options include drinking lots of fluids (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties) before bedtime to force the dog to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in his body and spirit.
The less stress, the better the life force that is present. Each individual has the potential to find absolute peace and pleasure.
anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only things that stand in the way of that goal are the tension and negativity in each of us.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded by the path of love of Mahayana and many techniques of Indian yoga.
TibetanBuddhism, is very simple. consists ofundaliniyoga,meditationand the path of love that embraces all.
Kundalini yoga,undalini (enlightenment) energy is awakened by movement, inhalation and exhalation practices, mantras and visualizations.
The central focus of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the USA.
As the war ended two years later, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for 40 years and have proxy warfare, in battle points from Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, to Cuba and many other places.

However, these plans were thwarted almost overnight when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers entered and created the Belarus and Ukraine fronts, having invaded eastern Polish territories in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way to move large parts of the population and goods overseas.
work of the marines has long been the purpose of ensuring that your country can transport your own people and goods, while at the same time preventing your enemy from transporting his own people and goods.
one of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. the Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.

If the Allies failed, the Germans would probably conquer Britain as they did the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes are starting to keep them for easy access to milk, wool, meat and leather.
The domesticated goats were generally kept in herds that roamed hills or other pastures, often looked after by goat herders who were usually children or teenagers, the equivalent of the more widely known shepherds.

Though the wooden rails consisted only of parallel wooden boards, these allowed the horses to pull the wagons to achieve greater speeds and to pull larger loads than on the rarest rough roads of the day.
The wooden rack connectors appeared early enough and were intended to hold the railway rails in place, but gradually it became apparent that the rails would be much more functional with an iron support at the top.
This was a common method, but the iron created greater compression on the wheels of the wooden wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767 the first railway lines made entirely of iron appeared.
The earliest known means of transport was walking, people began walking standing up two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning standing man).
their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as is usual.

We have the potential to lead a more sustainable life, to join the environmental movement, and maybe to be activist so that we can somehow reduce the problems of the future.
like treating symptoms in many cases, but if we don't want a temporary treatment, we're going to have to find the source of the problems and neutralize them.

After being approved by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten note, signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson, was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing press.
Throughout the night, 150 to 200 copies were printed, otherwise known as the Dunlap Prosecutors.
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon on July 8 in the outdoor space of Independence Hall.
A copy was sent on July 6 to George Washington, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. Another arrived on August 10 in London.
The 25 Dunlap pamphlets that we know still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.

t they're not seen in the dinosaur category by many because they have feathers with the ability to fly.
t much in birds makes them look like dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two legs like Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Computer now rely on managing information encoded by a binary system.
To use computer terminology, a binary number can only take one or two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
The symptoms such as vomiting are general enough that an immediate diagnosis is not possible.
The most valid sign that someone has been poisoned internally is an open medicine bottle or some toxic household chemical in the room.
Read the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison.
The term koreos is officially used by etymologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from the ancient peoples' familiarity with bedbugs, which were insects that easily adapted to parasitic on humans.
The killer insect and the bug are plutoid, adapted to live in the nest or enclosure of their host.
In the United States of America, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological condition among the younger and middle-aged.
Scoliosis (MS) is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research shows that women are twice as likely to get multiple sclerosis as men.
Two partners may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interest or the best interest of the child they have.
These couples can design an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.

Biologists and philosophers have focused on classical texts, specifically the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotelis's views on scientific matters, including psychology in them, enjoyed acceptance.
As the Greek intellectuals lost ground, the West was cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed that often the rhythms recorded in physiology and behavior depend upon the existence of endogenous cycles, as well as their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic signals, have been recorded for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators, continuing their cycle even when they have no external stimuli.
Hersey and Chase's experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA is genetic material.
Hersey and Chase took phages, or germs, to put their genetic material into some kind of bacteria.
They did two experiments where they marked either the DNA in the phage using radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein using radioactive sulfur.
mutations may cause a wide variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are stem cells.
Only mutations in stem cells can be passed on to offspring, as mutations in other cells can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who naturally seek out landscapes to enjoy nature, along with the wild flora and fauna of the area.
Examples of activities in a given location are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks, as well as studying information about the ecosystem.

Everyday morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to their workplace and meet others, whose work destination is the place where the first ones just left.
In dynamic shuttle transport everyone is connected to each other somehow and they support a transport system based on private vehicles.
sciences show that this huge carbon economy has taken the biosphere out of a stable state that has supported the evolution of the human species for the last two million years.


Why do transport systems cause such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more substantial to blame?
Traffic Flow is the analysis of the movement of specific drivers and cars between two places and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is not easy, as it is impossible to predict with complete certainty the behaviour of drivers.
Thanks to the fact that drivers tend to behave within a reasonable range, traffic flows tend to have some logical consequence and can be approximated mathematically.
To better represent traffic intensity, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) intensity, (2) density and (3) speed.
The Commission has also taken into account the fact that the Commission has not yet adopted a decision on the granting of aid to the construction of the road network.
The first animals to take off were insects, whose ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body backwards.
This provides them with a greater variety of small hiding places than predators.

Long ago, Aristarchus reported that the solar system rotated perimeter of the sun.
Some believed he was right, but many believed the opposite, that the Solar System moved around the Earth and the Sun (even around other stars).
e Earth doesn't seem to be moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world, carrying over eight times as much water as the second longest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, sometimes reaching six miles.
20% of the water that Earth's rivers discharge into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and gathers water from thousands of smaller rivers.

The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were fascinated by the monuments of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800, making it the smallest independent state in the world and the one with the smallest population.
The Vatican uses the Italian language in its legislation and official announcements.



The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything is created by the mixture of one or more of the four elements, namely, earth, water, air, and fire.
He mainly looked like the 4 forms of matter (in this sequence): solid, aqueous, air and plasma, although he also assumed that they were changing into new substances to form this presence.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals.Remember that there are many chemical elements in the periodic table.

There are also alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon.
Toda la materia en el universo esta hecha de partículas muy pequeñas, los atomos.
The size of atoms is so extremely small that trillions of them could fit in the dot at the end of this sentence.
So, pencil when it came out, it became a good friend to a lot of people.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods have come along, the place and usefulness of the pencil has been degraded.
People are now texting on computer screens without ever having to grab a scratch.
You might wonder what happens to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The fission bomb is based on the principle that it takes energy to form a nucleus with lots of protons and neutrons.
Like a heavy cart rolling up a hill, and then tearing the core apart again releases some of that energy.
Some individuals have unstable nuclei and this leads them to break up if little or no pressure is applied.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and about 100 km on the far side.
It's thinner under the seas and thicker under the highlands.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Content theories are focused on finding out what makes people click or what attracts them.
These theories argue that individuals have certain needs and/or desires that have become internalized as they mature and reach adulthood.
These theories study what makes certain people want what they want and what is in their environment that will lead them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.

This type of manager has a hard time making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, making assessments, assigning responsibilities and putting people ahead of their responsibilities.
On the other end of the spectrum, you can transform into a stranger who feels that he or she has to change everything the group has done and take it for granted.
After all, the person ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team is the leader.
This behavior often results in a rift between the leader and the rest of the team.

The virtual team members often act as a link to their immediate physical team.
often more autonomous than conventional team members, as their teams may meet according to different time zones, which may not be acceptable to their local administration.
(Larson and La Fasto, 1989, p. 109) is another unique element of a virtual group.

Why would an organisation want to go through this time-consuming process of establishing learning of organisation's capabilities? One of the goals for the practical application of learning of organisation's capabilities concepts is innovation.
Creativity and intelligence are fostered when all available resources are appropriately used in the functional parts of an organisation.
As a result, the process whereby an organisation works together to overcome an obstacle may lead to new innovative processes in favour of meeting the needs of the customer.

Angell (2006) explains the continuous learning approach as a method used to help organisations to gauge their performance level.
Neurobiological evidence provides physical evidence for a theoretical study of consciousness, so it narrows the scope of research by making it clearer.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior is a help for researchers and their study.
It's long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumors affect behavior and may cause changes in certain mental functions.
The advent of new technologies has allowed us to see and explore brain structures and processes that humans have never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to create simulation models that will help us understand the processes that are going on in our minds.
Although AI is largely a science fiction, it is nevertheless an important branch of computing that deals with adapting behavior, learning and intelligence to a machine.
research in artificial intelligence involves building machines for the purpose of automating tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
examples include checking, programming, responding to customer diagnoses and queries, handwriting recognition, spoken speech recognition and facial recognition.

AI is now widely used in the financial, healthcare, engineering and military sectors, and is embedded in various home computer software applications and computer games.

Technology offers the solution with virtual tours where students can see museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful artwork while in their classroom.

n example, each year students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, and each year it is updated, but the old versions are kept online and serve as a reference book.

The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and became a strategic port for the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids who gave it the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city and named it Daru I-Batiya, while the name Casablanca was given by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least market-friendly places in all of Morocco.
It's easy to find places around the old Medina that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as tajin, ceramics, leather goods, coconuts and a wide range of snacks, but they're all touristy.
Goma is a city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo with a high tourist traffic in the eastern end near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by the eruption of the volcano Niragongo, whose lava covered almost all the streets of the city, especially the city center.

The town is also a stopover for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking and observation programs in Africa.

Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the northern and eastern part of South Africa and is on the border line with Mozambique at the eastern point, Zimbabwe at the northern end, while its southern border is considered the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different areas of ecological interest each supporting different species of wildlife.
It is one of the most notable attractions in South Africa and is referred to as the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are day-trip entrance tickets for the park.

Hong Kong Island is also the name of the territory of Hong Kong and is a magnet for many visitors.
The splendor of the buildings that make up Hong Kong's cityscape has been likened to a glittering bar chart highlighted by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbor.

Hong Kong Island's urban development has been mostly stacked in high density on dry land along the north coast.
This is where the British colonialists occupied, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, extending 50 miles [80 km] from the coastline of mainland Bangladesh and India.
Sandarbhans has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest located in Indian territory is called Sandarbhans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps, they include some of the last remnants of the mighty jungle that once covered the plain of the Ganges.
Sunderbonn covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water/element zones.
Since 1966 Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 deer.




Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 metres high, 378 metres long and have two hallways with a width of 3.50 metres.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011 and was closed to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group to inhabit the lands now known as eastern Paraguay, and lived as semi-groups of hunters who also engaged in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco area was home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaícurú and the Payagua, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.

You can make a currency conversion at the only bank on the islands which is located on Stanley across from the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands and Stanley credit cards as well as US dollars are usually accepted.
On remote islands credit cards will probably not be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted; ask the owners in advance to find out which payment methods are accepted.
It's almost impossible to convert Falkland currency outside the islands, so you do the currency conversion before you leave the islands.
Montevideo is south of the equator, so it's summer when it's winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zone. In summer, temperatures above 30 °C are common.
