28-year-old chef found dead in a shop in San Francisco
A 28-year-old chef who just moved to San Francisco this week was found dead in the stairs of a local shop.
But the victim’s brother said he couldn’t imagine who would want to hurt him, and said “It’s all fine.”
The San Francisco body inspector's office said the body found on Wednesday morning at the Sieda shopping center was confirmed as a 28-year-old San Francisco resident, Frank Galicia.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death case was convicted of his murder and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim’s brother, Louis Galicia, told the U.S. radio station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who previously served as a fluid water chef in Boston, found an ideal job for a fluid water chef in San Francisco’s Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesman at the Sons & Daughters restaurant said they were “very shocked” by Frank’s death.
The spokesman said, "We are a small team of a family that is intimate and we will miss him deeply."
In this sad moment, we express our deep sympathy and compassion to Frank’s family and friends.
Louis Galicia says Frank originally lived in the hostel, but recently "all has finally gone well."
Louis Galicia told KGO: “Frank found an apartment while getting in touch with a girl.”
Louis Galicia said he could not imagine who would want to offend his brother.
Frank has a good heart and a wide heart.
Louis Galicia says: “Frank often cooked dinner for his family.”
He never wanted to dispute with his family.
He is a person who follows everyone’s opinion.
Louis Galicia says, “Everything in the world may be wrong, but Frank is called an out-of-the-going show man.”
If you have clues, please call the San Francisco Police Bureau to report the phone 415-575-4444.
Primary doctors strike: calls for new labor operations
Primary Doctors Representatives called on the Alliance to approve its new labour action against new contractual disputes.
The British Medical Association’s Primary Medical Committee will ask all its members to support more labor operations starting in early September.
The primary medical committee said the ministers did not resolve concerns about the contract.
Primary doctors and medical students voted against a contract agreement concluded with the British Medical Association in July.
58% of voters voted against the contract deal.
The Chairman of the Committee of Primary Doctors, Ellen McCourt, said in a letter to members on Twitter on Thursday night that the government "has always kept silent" on the issues that lead to contracts being repressed.
She said: "In view of this, the Executive Committee of the Primary Medical Committee has voted in full to reject the proposed new contract and calls for formal consultation on all concerns."
With regard to the government’s silence, the Executive Committee of the Primary Medical Committee has today officially requested the Council of the British Medical Association to hold a special meeting to approve a long-term plan to upgrade labour operations starting in early September.
The dispute has led primary doctors to a total of six strikes this year, including the first comprehensive strike in the history of the UK’s national healthcare system.
Dr. Johann Malawana, the leader of the British Medical Association’s primary doctors, resigned after a vote was opposed to the contractual provisions recommended by the British Medical Association.
In the meeting before the vote of 54,000 primary doctors and medical students, he said to members of the British Medical Association that the deal was good, so it should be accepted.
After the vote, the Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be compulsory for England’s healthcare staff.
Russia and Turkey: “Gogger does not join the alliance?”
A move ends a crisis.
Russia and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday, with the two sides holding their hands and announcing the formal end of the eight-month oral war and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin welcomes the President of Turkey in a glorious hall in St. Petersburg Palace, I have a strong feeling: this reconciliation is what Ankara most desires to see.
Yes, the two sides have hand in hand.
However, even according to the criteria of Mr. Putin, Mr. Putin was just a mild smile, and he almost did not express his enthusiasm.
It is that Recep Tayyip Erdogan has five times mentioned “good friend” Putin.
I don’t remember.
At the same time, he promised that his relations with Russia will return to the level before the crisis and even to a higher level.
The next day, a newspaper wrote that Mr. Erdogan was acting as if nothing happened.
But I think his passion suggests some opposite things.
However, Mr. Putin's continued cool attitude indicates that he has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing he mentioned in the opening chapter was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter on the Syrian border.
The reaction of Moscow was intense.
Mr. Putin criticized the incident sharply, accusing Ankara of concealing Moscow behind it.
Attack from the so-called friends is more difficult to accept.
The two sides are difficult, and it is even impossible to rebuild true trust.
Since November, the opinion of the Russian people has also changed.
For months, government-controlled media have made a shocking mass attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, the Turks seem to be responsible for everything.
Among them, the worst is the accusations from senior officials: Mr. Erdogan’s family profits from the illegal oil transactions in the so-called Islamic State-controlled Syria area.
He has clearly denied that claim.
However, the news from St. Petersburg shows that it is time to look forward.
After all, this meeting is the condition that Putin receives apologies from Turkish President Erdogan.
Russia can declare victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of the cessation of war are evident.
First of all, Erdogan was more likely to be withdrawn after the coup failed last month, so he needed the support of all his friends.
The continued terrorist attacks have clearly caused a great blow to him.
There are also economic motivations.
Russia's sanctions have been a huge impact on Turkey, especially the ban on airplane services that can transport millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The figure has declined significantly by 90%.
With the flights recovering, the Russian travel agencies and airline companies will definitely relax.
They will meet the end of the Mediterranean tourism.
The National TV even predicts this week that as soon as Turkish agricultural products are re-liberated, the prices of fruits and vegetables will fall.
A report by the Moscow newspaper Vedemosti said: “Tourists went, tomatoes came back.”
For Moscow, this visit also has an additional political value.
Ankara is angry with the weak response of the Western world to the intention to take over.
Furthermore, Ankara is unhappy with the slow progress in the EU joining negotiations and Putin’s long-term involvement, and Putin is enthusiastic to take advantage of political colds and weaken the relations between Turkey and the Western world.
Due to the support of the elected authorities after the coup failed, the Russian leader will get an additional point from Ankara.
Please note that this is a gift for Moscow, which has always been deeply fearful of regime change.
Therefore, the meeting held at this glorious coastal palace made Russia and Turkey two countries rejected and abused by the Western world, an analyst describes it as "Greg does not join the alliance".
However, despite public reconciliation, there are still significant differences between the two sides.
Moscow has recently played a role in Syria, while Russia and Turkey support the opposite group.
It is predictable that after three hours of initial talks, the two presidents said at the conference that they had not yet discussed the topic.
The President of Turkey has deliberately avoided the issue of disputes between the two sides, and Putin emphasizes it.
The two sides have not reached a clear consensus on how to pursue an agreement on the issue of Syria.
It is a good thing for the leaders of the two countries to re-establish the dialogue, in the event of the months of open hostility and the possibility of a major catastrophe caused by the crash of the North Atlantic Convention by Turkey's Russian fighter aircraft.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve customers outside Scotland.
According to the chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland, the bank will be simplified into a logistics sector.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve customers outside Scotland.
Ross McJune told the British Broadcasting Company’s Scotland branch that the Royal Bank of Scotland’s brand was once committed to its global ambition.
But eight years ago, at the end of the fall, he was forced to receive salvation and since then he abandoned that pursuit.
During that time, brand strategists used ‘RBS’ to protect other consumer financial brands.
The group has spent millions of pounds in sponsorship of international sports events, such as Football Six Nations and Wimbledon Tennis Championship champion Andy Murray.
But now, the right approach is to make more national brands standing in the forefront.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used for Scottish customers, but will not respond to the original.
In England and Wales, all quotes outside the headquarters and securities will be changed to the National Westminster Bank.
The Alster Bank brand has been used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland Autonomous Region.
There are also some other more prominent smaller private banking brands, such as Customer Bank, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McJean was interviewed during his visit to Inverness County customers and staff.
He told the British Broadcasting Company’s Scotland branch, “The Royal Bank of Scotland brand will eventually become our investor brand and one of the employees’ employed brands, as we are now, in a greater sense, a bank with many brands.
As the bank itself became an international brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Currently, I’m going to say that we’re no longer focused on the world, we’ve turned our eyes to our homeland.
Each brand represents different industries, and our employees serve customers through different brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland has demonstrated that it will not continue to sponsor the Six Nations Championships; at the same time, it has been trying to improve the image of different brands sponsoring sports events.
The CEO said: “It’s time to become a multi-brand bank because privately we’ve been looking for how to become a better customer service bank.”
If three years ago we wanted to be a big bank with many brands would be ridiculous.
We are currently focusing on customer needs and I believe you have noticed these changes.
I think we can restart these brands, and now the time is right.
DeTuri won 3,000 wins in a career with Predilection in Neumarkit
Newmakit's two victories helped Dae Turry to 3,000 victories in the career, after which he shed champagne to celebrate.
On Friday, the professional horse rider, Frankie Dettori, won his 3,000th victory in Newmarket.
He planned Predilection from the hand of the coach John Gosden on the road, in which night he gained two victories and also achieved 3,000 career victories.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth professional horse rider to reach this trail in the field of the playoffs.
The top five are Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery, and Willie Carson.
The three-time championship winner at Ghayyar, Dae Turi, said, “This is very special.”
I am excited because my family is there.
I am pleased with my achievements at Newcastle because I started from here 30 years ago.
It’s not a large-scale racing event, nor the Royal Ascot, which is just a regular Friday night with 20,000 spectators.
I am pleased and humble.
DeTuri took Predilection after winning, causing all the joy.
In the field of obstacles, two Knights achieved this achievement, respectively champion Knight Richard Johnson and now retired 20th champion Sir Anthony McCoy, of which Sir McCoy achieved more than 4,300 victories in his record-breaking career.
Berger was the ninth German champion with 4,493 victories in his career.
De Turi was one of the best ridders of contemporary times, so it was not surprising that he had achieved this pivotal achievement, and there were not many people who had achieved this achievement before him.
He was fashionable and well-known, but the real thing that made him stand out in the weight room was his tactical reasoning.
He was a great horse ambassador, and over the years his passion and charm attracted a lot of fans for the sport.
A few weeks ago, I told Dae Turry at Epsom that if he wasn’t just a weekend with a racing rider, he should have been able to win 6,000 games!
Indeed, it is too important that DeTuri is the UK’s best horse winner for thirty years.
His character is vibrant, which is a good thing for the English horse race, but in addition, he is still an incredible rider.
De Turi celebrates this milestone with his iconic jump-down movement.
From the jumping line to the jumping down, for twenty years, De Turry has been a typical representative in the UK's square field.
His career was like a mountain ride.
He won several tournaments, including the famous "Seven Round Victory" that he won in 1996 at the Royal Escoat, but he also suffered a plane crash and was also banned from taking the drug prohibited.
Three years ago, when he returned to the stadium after the end of the six-month interdiction period, he had a great deal of effort, but he demonstrated a surprising character advantage and finally returned to the peak, to those with a doubtful attitude.
He may not be able to do it for a long time – Dae Turry said before that he hoped to participate at least by the age of 50.
Russian President Putin resigns office of head of Sergey Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed the office of President Sergei Ivanov.
For many years, Mr. Ivanov has been a part of Mr. Putin’s core group.
Ivanov, 63, is now appointed as the Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
A statement from the Kremlin said Mr. Putin has “annonced the dismissal of Ivanov’s office of head of the Russian presidential office,” but no reason was given.
Anton Vaino, who began his role as Mr. Ivanov’s assistant in 2012, was appointed as his successor.
Mr. Vaino is now 44 years old and a former diplomat.
He was born in 1972 in the capital of Estonia, Tallinn, graduated from the famous Moscow National Institute of International Relations (MGIMO), and worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he managed the presidential draft and government staff, the Kremlin website (using Russian) as said.
After being appointed, he said to Mr. Putin, “Thank you for your trust.”
I think the most important task of the government is to support the heads of state to draft laws and control instructions for implementation.
Mr. Putin told Russian television on Friday that Mr. Ivanov himself requested his resignation and recommended Mr. Vaino to take over himself.
Is this smile convincing?
Moscow is disappointed with this.
For a long time, Sergey Ivanov has been one of Putin’s closest assistants, and, like Putin, he has also worked at the Soviet Security Agency (KGB).
As the head of the office, he was one of the most influential people in the country.
During a meeting with President Putin broadcast by the National Television, the two said the head of the office had requested his resignation.
Despite the smile in front of the camera, almost no one was convinced – especially this time before parliamentary elections.
So, does this lead to a defeat in a kind of power struggle?
Not known yet.
But the official statements — a candidate who was once considered a presidential candidate — suddenly chose to take over the environmental policy of Russia — raised many doubts.
The Kremlin website quotes Mr. Ivanov’s conversation with Mr. Putin, saying, “Yes, at the beginning of 2012, I had in a conversation asked you to give me this hard-to-do position, even to say it’s a troubled position, a four-year term.”
As a result, I have been the chairman of the presidential office for four years and eight months.”
Mr. Ivanov was in this position in December 2011.
He has previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council, like Mr. Putin, and a former member of the National Security Agency.
At the end of the 1990s, when Mr. Putin served as the Director of the Federal Security Bureau (FSB, formerly the National Security Bureau), Mr. Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
After Mr. Putin arrived in office, he also appointed Mr. Ivanov as one of his five most trusted people.
The outside world once believed Mr. Ivanov might be the president of Russia after Mr. Putin's second term ends, because the three repairs are a violation of the Constitution.
But this post was eventually attributed to another close assistant of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
After three and a half years, Mr. Putin was the prime minister of Russia.
Mysterious Fish Shows Banff A Garden
A resident in Banff found a fish in his garden and then asked for help.
Kevin Bain believes that these 75 fish are likely to be a sandwich wrapped by the sea storms.
Mr. Bain lived about 500 meters from the sea, and he posted a video of this strange scene on Periscope, hoping that someone could explain to him why these two-inch long fish appeared.
The Queensbury Bridge is now passed to Faff.
The project worth £13.5 million is planned to be completed in May 2017.
The engineers have connected the north side of the Queensferry Crossing with the high-level bridge, which is now connected to Faff.
The four bridges of the "bridge wind" located near three bridges of each bridge are now close to completion, and the project is the first bridge of the bridge.
This bridge begins in Faff with a length of 600 meters and a weight of 30,000 square tons.
It used 10,000 metric tons of steel, 20,000 metric tons of concrete, and 46 slides.
The project, funding £13.5 million, is planned to be completed in May 2017.
Economist Keith Brown visited the site today and became one of the first people to climb the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic moment in the construction process of the Queensbury Bridge."
We all witnessed the engineering work on such a massive project that the building of the bridge only used more than 30,000 m2 of concrete and steel.
Although the size and weight of the bridge are huge, the completion of the slopes between the high bridge and the bridge surface requires accurate work and a very accurate installation.
In total, almost 79 per cent of the total bridge surface is now installed and the last part of the bridge’s concrete bridge surface is now in Rosyth, which means that all bridges are ready.
Michael Martin, Project Director of the Queensferi Bridge Building Company, said: "No matter which bridge project, the first dragon is a major shift."
With regard to the merit of a great project, this time the coal shows the advanced civil engineering technology.
After installing the last section of the road panel and connecting it to the extended North Bridge Road panel, then it is necessary to complete the remaining gap on the north side or close to the ground side.
To complete this operation, it is necessary to move the northern high staircase to the south of the bridge 700 mm.
This is a huge task and a very accurate task.
Say it is huge, it is because the high bridge is 222 meters long, weighing about 6,000 meters of tons, it needs to pull out a curvature of about 3%.
To say it is accurate, it is because the engineering team needs to make sure the deviation is very small, with only a few millimeters on each side.
What is pleasant is that everything is going well.
Simon Bailes to win the Women's Gymnastics All-Power Championship
Forget the pressure.
Forget the cheating.
Simone Biles is not affected by all this.
The horse is full of vitality.
The balance of the tree is sufficient.
Free gymnastics is amazing.
The overall performance is great.
It was finally the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast won the All-Power Championship on Thursday and fully showed her talent to lead the world in gymnastics at the Olympic Stadium.
She won a total of 62,198 gold medals, "Final Five" team member Ali Raisman and bronze winner Russian player Aliya Mustafina.
Simone-Bayers from the United States held a balanced wooden performance on Thursday at the 2016 Summer Olympics' art gym women's individual all-power final in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Bears helped the American team to four rounds of personal all-power in women's Olympic gymnastics, she personally won five medals at the Olympic Games, further insisting that she is this generation, and the best gymnastic team ever.
At the moment she saw her end, Bailes couldn’t stop flowing tears, and she finally ended this long journey.
By the way, Bayers fall into the "Athletes for decades" like Michael Phelps, who raise their sports projects to a new height:
Bears has been in the championship for the last three years and has won a total of 15 World Championships medals, including ten gold medals.Their intention is to train her daily hard to higher accuracy.The 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton says: “Bears is the best gymnast I’ve ever seen.
There is a last match in Brazil, but the match with which it is said to be the competition of Bayers with other gymnastics, rather than the match between her own and the huge expectation of pressure.
If Bears didn’t get back to her home in Sprin, Texas, they would be very disappointed.
Simone Bailes (left) and Lesman from the United States are hugging each other and they have won gold and silver medals at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in August, respectively.
Bayers won the first gold medal on Tuesday, giving a surprise gift to the upcoming national team coach Martha Karolyi.
Although Bayers insisted that he did not plan for the future in the course of the year-round championship throne, the fact is not exactly that.
One part of Bears' freedom gymnastics—including the piece of her iconic tinting-link—willed to Latin music, which she often heard in the only one street apartment of the Rio Olympics Stadium.
This is not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by grandparents during childhood and discovered by the mother of coach Aimee Boorman during an athletic field visit, has now grown into a central force.
Since the summer of 2013, Bears has not failed in the All-Power Competition, and she will definitely win if she wants to win.
Just a little ahead of Mustafa after twice turning is an illusion.
Balance trees and free gymnastics two projects of the defence world champion Bears are awaiting.
Her balance tree score 15.433, free gym score 15.933 .
Waiting for the final score out, Lesman kissed Bears a bit. When Bears learned that he had achieved his dreaming achievements, he left tears.
Lesman's performance was a bit like revenge four years ago, when she joined third, but lost to Mustafa in the final.
But this time, the 22-year-old captain, which was called "Mother" by the Americans, was far ahead.
She kissed the crowd after the end of liberty gymnastics and announced her return, but this return before it sometimes seemed doubtful.
Bears is only 19 years old.Since the beginning of this week, his news has been viral on Twitter.For Bears, his life has been given a new meaning.
Six-year-old Mahaj Brown survived in Philadelphia shooting
Police said a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, a six-year-old boy who was the second shot in the city this week.
The child's grandparents confirmed to CBS Philadelphia that the child was shot by Mahaj Brown.
They said Brown's abdominal cavity, legs, arms, and abdomen had a number of wounds, but the child was awake in the course of his medical treatment.
“He’s suffered a lot of sin, and the small body is hit by a shot,” his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the TV.
I just don’t dare to believe.
The boy was in a critical condition at the hospital and has been undergoing several surgeries.
His family told the TV that the child was hoping to recover.
He was about to start his first class at a local primary school.
Brown was one of the four people shot down in the Germantown area.
Three of the others were shot, two of them 29 years old and one 32 years old.
According to CBS Philadelphia, one of the 29-year-old victims is in critical condition and two others are in stable condition.
The TV said the child and the 29-year-old victim were found on the front seat of the car.
The other two victims were not in the car, and the police are investigating whether there were a gunman among the injured.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it looked like several shooters were shooting.
A lot of aggressive weapons were found on the site, so it is possible to assume that they used different aggressive weapons.
As a result, this is undoubtedly a continued war.
People on both sides of the street have a shell on the walks.
“Therefore, there is a number of armed persons at the scene at the time in a violent state of war,” Philadelphia police chief Anthony Ginaldi told the TV.
Many houses and vehicles were damaged in the area.
The arrest operation has not yet been carried out, and the police are said to watch the video.
On Tuesday, a six-year-old girl was shot in her arm while playing at the door of her house in the West Oak Lane community.
She is recovering and the police are still pursuing the suspect.
Why We Need Simon, Gabriel and Laurie
That’s how I evaluate this year’s women’s Olympic gym, for more than one reason.
First, since 1984, I have gone to every Summer Olympics, but the United States has never taken that dominant position.
Second, the gym has three excellent gymnastics – Simone Biles, Gabriel Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who have always inspired many colorful girls.
The composition of this team made everyone proud, as it included the Jewish Ali Raisman and the Catholic Madison Kocian.
The team finally looks like the American team.
It also consolidated the top position of black and Latin women in this movement.
Over the past four years, the leading female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year, Simon and Gabriel ranked first and second.
This is too great.
In the last Olympics, Gabriel Douglas was "surprisingly" the Olympic champion, which made the United States happy.
Today, the world can see the wonderful performance of the three world champions Simon Bayers, Douglas and Laurie Ernandes, who are able to interpret the conventional gymnastic skills to be divine.
On Thursday, Simon helped the American team reach four rounds in the women's individual all-power project.
Her teammate Ali Lesman won the silver medal.
We’ve reached the top of this sport, but that’s not the case in the U.S. Gymnasium classrooms.
Simone, Gabriel and Laurie’s way to the Olympic team is the same as Ali and Madison.
They are the "Final Five" as the next Olympic gym will be composed of four gymnastics, which is Marta Karolyi's last year of training.
But the reality is that gymnastics is a costly sport, with gymnastics mainly training in private gymnastics clubs, their parents need to pay training, facilities, trips, clothes, competitions and hotel fees (including counselling and gymnastics and family fees), and the list of costs is increasing.
Most of the gym clubs are located in the rich suburbs that can provide support for the industry.
All training for gymnastics is done in these clubs, a long-term expenditure for the family of gymnastics.
Bears' coach Aimee Boorman and Ernand's coach Maggie Haney have been training them since the two gymnastics began to exercise.
We must bring more affordable and more affordable gym training to countless young girls deeply affected by Simon, Gabriel and Laurie.
Twenty years ago, I founded my own gymnastic foundation.
In my organization, we offer free and cheap gymnastics to more than 15,000 urban youths (mainly black and Spanish-Americans) in the Black Residential Area and train national and even world championships.
In September, we will expand to the end of Truth (my homeland) to those who deserve this learning opportunity and will provide high-quality gymnastics to the young people who benefit from this magnificent Olympic sport.
Gymnastics helps to develop the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body, and also helps to develop the spirit of patience, self-discipline and determination.
These can bring lifelong benefits to a person’s health, academic and work success.
Inspired by this team, thousands of young girls will learn gymnastics, which is really great.
Participation in sports is important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting moment.
Thanks to Simon, Ali, Laurie, Gabriel and Madison for the “Girl Force” that they have shown in the Golden Medal of the Olympic Group, and thanks to them for encouraging so many young girls from different backgrounds to open the way to health, strength and success.
After rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal, primary doctors plan to start further strike
The ministers initially wanted to end the dispute caused by the change by accepting a contract amended by officials of the British Medical Association (BMA), but 58% of the 37,000 primary doctors who voted were against the contract.
In July, Mr. Hunt revealed plans for compulsory implementation of contracts, saying the UK’s National Health Service System (NHS) is currently in a “vacuum zone” and a slight delay would harm the interests of employees and patients.
The new contract first refers to the amendment of primary doctors' night-and-weekend working practices in order to improve the care of unusual working hours.
Yesterday night, Dr. Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Primary Doctors Committee, said in a statement: “Primary Doctors are still serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially concerns that it will exacerbate the current labour crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly.
It’s only eight weeks left from the first doctors to sign the new contract, and we need progress, and there’s little time.
The BMA tries to resolve disputes through negotiations, but people are not willing to participate, and sometimes the government responds in silence.
Nevertheless, just last month we got the promise by Jeremy Hunt, who said his doors were always open.
“Jeremy Hunt now needs to take action, cancel forced execution, and solve primary doctors’ concerns.”
If he did not do so, the primary doctors clearly said they were ready to take further labor operations.
The last strike occurred at the end of April, resulting in 13,000 regular surgeries and 100,000 reservations delayed as nurses and consultants covered the doctors on the checkline.
The ministers initially wanted to end the dispute caused by the change by accepting the BMA-modified contract.
BMA hopes to pay better weekends for 54,000 primary doctors involved in the contract.
NHS Employers CEO Daniel Mortimer called on primary doctors not to make any more strikes.
Mr. Mortimer said: “The work action is very low, but it will, on the contrary, cause pressure on the team and services that have been all-in-the-countered, causing concerns, concerns and confusion for patients, careers and their families.
Over the past two months, we have been continuously negotiating with the Committee of Primary Doctors, and together with the Ministry of Health and other departments, we have responded actively to their concerns about the role of the caregivers and the disclosure of reports.
Employers want to continue to actively explore other important topics, such as the deployability, the flexibility of training, other training, training costs, common awareness of the curriculum, graduate holidays and gender wage differences in the field of health care, which illustrate that employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health are very important to the agreements reached with BMA in November, February and May.
2 pounds of drugs per day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Officials recommend promoting a drug for £2 a day to more patients and to extend the time of taking the drug, after which thousands of cardiovascular patients will benefit from the drug.
Anticagrelor can reduce the risk of recurrence of heart disease with heart disease.
The drug is taken continuously for 12 months after a heart attack and can reduce the risk of a stroke or a recurring heart attack.
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Optimization (NICE) recommends that patients continue to take the drug for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
But now, the NHS regulator NICE recommends that patients continue to take the drug for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
In England, approximately 140,000 people suffer from heart disease every year, and one-quarter of them continues to suffer from recurrence of heart disease or stroke.
Heart attacks and stroke are caused by the formation of spots in the fat substance deposited in the arterial walls.
If the spots are broken, it will lead to blood clots, thereby preventing the blood flow to the heart, leading to a heart attack.
If the blood clots move, they get into the blood flow, blocking the blood flow into the brain, leading to stroke.
Patients who have experienced a heart attack are at a higher risk of a heart attack again.
Made by the British company AstraZeneca, it is sold by Brilique as a brand name, which can reduce the risk of developing a blood clot by reducing the formation of blood clots.
The NICE guidelines presented today recommend that patients take 90 mg of Calgary for 12 months and 60 mg of Calgary and 2 times aspirin daily for the following three years.
Prof. Carole Longson, director of the NICE Center for Health Technology Assessment, said: “Despite effective secondary preventive therapies, up to a quarter of patients with a history of a heart attack will regain or stroke, usually leading to severe consequences.
Fear of recurrence can have a significant negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
Evidence suggests that taking Kagre with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of recurrence of heart disease and stroke in patients who have experienced a heart attack.
The temporary recommendation for Kagre will provide more treatment options for thousands of people who benefit, and we are very pleased with it.
Due to the limited information on the effectiveness and safety of the drug after three years, especially the risk of bleeding, the guidelines are not recommended to continue its treatment after this period.
Computer culture makes “election fraud” spread in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was overwhelmed last year due to corruption, encouraging the publication of a government report.
The culture of “political correctness” has led to the widespread presence of electoral fraud in the Muslim community to be ignored, as the deadly government report reveals today.
Former Cabinet Minister Sir Eric Pickles accused police, election regulators and municipalities of missing evidence of abuse of elections because of "excessive sensitivity to racial division and religious issues."
The former community affairs minister, the current anti-corruption man, said the practice of taking a religious position to scare voters has a bad impact, and the police should be permitted to set up a warning line outside the voting station to protect voters who are scared.
He advised voters to carry their identity documents when voting to confirm their identity.
Currently, the voters can only indicate their name and address.
The report even suggests to paint untouchable paint on the voter’s fingers, preventing anyone from voting twice.
Sir Eric said it is necessary to increase the protection of reporters.
He calls on to increase the media’s understanding of the conference documents and the ways in which the informal committee or working group makes decisions.
“This is not only to prevent election fraud, but also to protect local governments from the poison of a wide variety of corruption cultures and financial fraud that is closely linked to them,” he said.
The report was published after the Tower Hamlets election scandal in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that there was a series of corruption and illegal acts in the office of mayor Rahman, and that they were to be revoked.
The court found that Rahman "very ridiculously abused" the religious emotions of the Muslim community and silently spoke about his allegations of racial discrimination and Islamic fear.
It is said that Rahman "proclaimed in the election campaign to vote for him as a religious obligation of faithful Muslims."
With up to 300 votes, there are doubts, and the voters may be false to voting for others.
Sir Eric says there is evidence that there is election fraud across the country.
He specially warned post-election fraud, allegedly that senior members of the Muslim community put pressure on voters, forcing them to vote for the candidates they appointed.
Sir Eric (in the photo) gave a number of suggestions on cleaning the voting mechanism, including bringing good identity documents to confirm his identity.
“The evidence shows that senior members, especially senior members of the background communities in Pakistan and Bangladesh, are pressing some vulnerable groups of ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, to make them vote according to their will.”
“Because they are too sensitive to racism and religious ‘political correctness’, they are worried that state institutions will not see such behaviors.
Sir Eric proposed 50 proposals to clean up the election mechanism, including strictly prohibiting political activists from processing mail voting documents in order to prevent "voting earnings".
The report also requires a rigorous review of the registration information to prevent the voter lists from being used for immigration and welfare fraud.Theresa May also considers the report.
These recommendations include requiring voters to present their identity documents before voting.
After the vote, the voter's finger was painted with untouchable paint, preventing someone from voting twice.
Systematic verification of the nationality of the voters to ensure the voting qualification.
The validity of automatic mailing voting requests is limited to three years.
It is prohibited for political activists and radicals to process completed mail votes and mail votes.
Police are allowed to set up a warning line around the voting station.
The amendment to the provisions of the law makes it easier to accuse the relevant persons of intimidation pursuant to the 1983 People's Representation Act.
Photographing at the voting stations is illegal.
Only English is available at voting stations (except in the area of Wales).
Strengthen training and ensure that staff strictly comply with the provisions of "Voters go to the Voting Hall separately".
Sir Eric is "surprising" to the Metropolitan Police, saying they did not submit any criminal charges after the Tower Hamlets incident.
“Rahman and his election directors have been corrupt and violated, and therefore have been punished by the election court withdrawal,” he said.
According to the criteria of criminal proof, he is undoubtedly guilty in many ways.
He also criticized the city council election registration department as a false “check box check”.
Sir Eric said: “The court last year threw the alarm on the Tower Hamlets judgment.
The country has a glorious tradition of the "Mother of Parliament", but some institutions are intimately disguised by voting fraud and the post-country resistance, which is really worrying and threatens this good reputation.
At the Rio Olympics, the cyclists who look like Princess Kate and other famous players are sought.
This week, at the 2016 Rio Olympics, the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand Prevot, who looks like Princess Kate, has been very popular with the audience.
But the 24-year-old Olympic player is not the only golden medal winner at the Summer Olympics, at least the social media does not think that.
Therefore, to commemorate the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces that appeared on the screen at the time, FEMAIL arranged a list of Olympic players who hit the Hollywood star.
The Hunter and the Wolf: American men shooter Brady Ellison (left) has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood.
In addition to the player who hit Kate on the cycling track, many internet users soon discovered that one of the shooters was just Leonardo DiCaprio's brother.
Since his pictures like the "Wolf of Wall Street" were revealed on Twitter, the American men's shooter, Brady Erison, has caused massive harassment on social media.
In fact, the shooter noticed the hacking on social media and acknowledged that he was small and someone said he looked like a little lion.
“I think I don’t look like it, except for the networks,” Brady told Huffington Post.
“He’s a beautiful look florist, so I think that’s a praise to me.
One of the most popular matchings at the 2012 London Olympics this year will undoubtedly be found more similarities: British jumping player Greg Rutherford looks like the very famous actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast, Aliya Mustafina, with a long pair of big eyes to speak, is accused of being similar to the Cuban-born American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, for years, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been brought to comparison with Glee's protagonist Matthew Morrison.
Clothes: The user believes Nathan Adrian is the "sport version" of the "Inception" actor.
Another old pair compared was the tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, whose eyelids and lips looked very similar.
The Russian swimmer Yulia Efimova and actress Annalynne McCord have the same bronze skin and blonde hair, while the American team's Nizhny Novgorod is compared by fans to "Sports Edition Joseph Gorgon Levitt".
Women: Football star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter Actress Jennifer Carpenter (right) has similar faces and eyes.
Not the only one: a Twitter user is happy to find that others also see these similarities.
Communication Theory: According to the user, this pair looks like it may have a reason.
One Twitter user recently said, “Other internet users also think Hope Soro and Jennifer Capont are actually the same.”
Indeed, this American football star and the protagonist of The Blood Doctor have a very similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh Jennings, her smile is almost the same as the actress Laura Linney; and the gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, her beautiful and brilliant smile and the smile of the star Gabriel Union.
CBC's Olympic Interpretator Apologizes for Comments on Chinese Swimming Athletes "Let Like a Pig"
On Wednesday, Byron MacDonald's comment on the 14-year-old General Eve included the fourth winner of the women's 4x200m free swimming competition raised the audience watching the Canadian Broadcasting Company (CBC) Olympic live broadcast.
A Canadian broadcaster CBC explained that the 14-year-old Chinese swimming boy would swim as fast as the smell would spread in the competition, and that the CBC was forced to apologize for it.
Interpretator Byron McDonald posted some of his own opinions at the end of the women's 4x200m free swimming match, when he thought his microphone was turned off.
The audience heard the CBC interpreter's team, the commenter with "colored glasses," said: "The 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake.
Because it was too exciting, it began to swim faster than the smell spread at the start, but later slowly as the head of the pig.
It is really thanks to her.
The fourteen-year-old Chinese swimmer, Eidane, was the second tournament, taking 1 minute 57 seconds 79 – behind Canadian Taylor Ruck 1.61 seconds, which then made the Canadian team shorten the gap with China.
The entire Canadian audience was surprised by the speaker’s voice and speech, and they quickly reacted on the internet.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: “The CBC interpreter said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer ‘was slow like a pig’?”
The fool doesn’t realize that it’s being broadcast.
The Chinese General Eidane, who took part in the women's 4x200m free swimming match final, was described as follows: "The 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake.
The criticism of Byron McDonald on Twitter quickly came to the ground on Twitter, many asking him to withdraw from the explanation.
When Twitter users heard that Byron McDonald was delayed in reacting, they did not stop.
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: “Wow #Bayern McDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and your behavior makes us all sound like a group of racists.
Shortly later, CBC radio chairman Scott Russel apologized for Byron's speech in live broadcast, saying: "We apologize for the comments on the performance of the swimmers live broadcast.
“We apologize for this untouchable word.
CBC apologizes more than 90 times to Twitter users who responded to the statement
Another interpreter, Scott Russel, apologizes for Byron.
After CBC copies their apologies and attached to more than 90 other Twitter users who protested by Byron's explanation
The channel also quickly apologized and issued a statement.
We apologize for saying this and broadcasting it out.
Last night, we took a quick action to apologize to the audience watching our live broadcasts and to the audience watching our social media.
It is to be explained that Byrne’s explanation is aimed at the performance of the swimmer, but not on her personal.
That is, the phrase was indeed incorrect, and Byron deeply apologizes for that.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald apologized in a live broadcast, saying his words do not mean half-person attack, and attempted to get rid of his speech.
“I want to spend some time apologizing for the words I made after the end of the women’s competition yesterday night,” he said on CBC’s Olympic Broadcast.
“I’m just commenting on the performance of the swimmers, not on their personal...
“Naturally, I don’t mean disrespect, I’m sorry.”
The Primark customer expressed anger over a woman who tried to wear underwear in the center of the store.
A woman in the center of a Primark store was dressing out her underwear and the customer in the store didn’t know where to look.
Worse, she also tried how she looked after wearing it, and then took off the underwear and put it back to the shelf.
She continued to browse the shelves and finally tried four underwear in the shop in the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone.
The woman tried her underwear in the Primark store in the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone and then put her back in the shelves.
At the time, Jenny Davidson (the mother of two children) said that after trying to wear the underwear, the mysterious woman "was dressed again and then went out of the store and did not buy anything."
She said, “No one can believe what they see.”
She stood in the center of the store, took out a shirt from the shirt, took out her shirt and shirt, and then dressed it like that.
“She didn’t try to go to a hidden place to try it – she just stood there, it’s very shy.
“When she dropped her underwear again, everyone was surprised and shocked. obviously, she was still unhappy, because she dropped her underwear back to the shelf.
After that, she tried three things like this, and finally found it was not what she liked, and then again dressed up and went out of the store.
“She doesn’t seem to care if someone looks at her—or never thought who would eventually buy the underwear she tried through.”
The 33-year-old Davidson, who lives in Kent, says, “I’m angry when I think someone will buy someone else’s underwear that has passed through and has not been cleaned.
This happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Mrs. Davidson added, “After she’s left, the dealer is obviously going to take care of these shorts, and it’s good that it’s so.”
“I hate to buy a new underwear home, but I found another woman tried through and was not cleaned.
Primark’s spokesman said: “Primark has already known what happened in our Folkestone store on August 9th.”
All problems with the goods have gone down.
How to use magia to protect yourself in a gun attack
The world is dangerous, but this video on Dailymail.com may bring you a bit of security.
We ask the Master of the Krav Maga Federation in New York, Rhon Mizrachi, to learn how to deal close to the gunman.
Whether he’s close to you from the front or behind, the video will teach you how to win.
Mizrachi says, if the shooter approaches you from the back, the first thing you have to do is turn around so that you can see the attacker and “clean the fire.”
Then hold the gun with your front arm and shoulders, and then hit the attacker's face with your wrist.
Then with his knees over his abdomen, when the attacker swallowed his body because of pain, turning the gun in his hand, shooting his face with a pipe and a reserve gun group, keeping the weapon always towards him.
If the shooter approaches from the front, use the same technique – let your body not be within the fire line range, take the gun and turn the gun so that the shooter cannot shoot.
At the same time, press the weight on the pistol and hit the attacker's chest, and turn the pistol from his tight hand, and then turn the pistol towards him.
Does it sound complex?
Watch the video and see how Mizrachi is done.
But remember that if you are not a magical master, the safest way to get rid of the robbery is to get money.
A gangster family destroyed a cheap rental house in Sultash, Conwar, before being deported.
A gangster family who was expelled because of the threat of their neighbors, destroyed the cheap rental house they lived before leaving, causing a loss of £50,000.
After a long series of complaints, Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilcock were evacuated from the cheap rental house in Sultash, Conville.
After being forced to dismiss from the house, housing association officials were surprised to find that it was seriously damaged.
There are holes everywhere on the wall, the floor is broken, the waste is thrown full of land, the walls are painted and disrupted.
After being deported, the family has been moving home and is said to live in private houses.
Donna McEvoy, the housing manager of the Conval County Housing Association, said she was concerned that the house was no longer rescued.
She said, “For those who live here, it’s a nightmare, I don’t think people can live like that.”
Now there are a lot of things to be considered, as this house is likely to become a less good element in Cornwall.
The family is famous, and their names are equally famous.
The couple had three sons, and they would live here from time to time.The police said the terrorist acts of the family included the use of baseball battle on the streets, the threat of the nearby residents, drug trafficking, drug trafficking, screaming, disputes and curses.
In June, the 47-year-old renter named Skeldon received an anti-social action resolution.
In this house that could be destroyed, many rooms were placed with long waste.
In the room that had once been drug trafficking, the floor was lifted up.
Neighbors say they often see them struggle on the streets and often call the police.
After giving them an extension of 11 weeks that allowed them to voluntarily move away, the Conval County Housing Association forced her and her husband to displace the housing this week.
Finally, the relaxed neighbors rejoiced and said that the previous life was just a human hell.
One neighbor said, “They don’t care for anyone.”
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was so bad.
We have seen the police coming to the door many times.
“Today morning we couldn’t sleep.
We woke up early, because it’s so quiet – we don’t get used to it yet!
They’ve finally gone, it’s great.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Managing Director of the Conval County Housing Association District, said the family failed to work well with the local government.
The family lived in this house for 20 years, and the police frequently visited it.
Waste and old toys are thrown on the side of the cheap rental grass.
He added: “It is unfortunate that the tenant did not take any responsibility for her behavior with her family, and the expulsion was the ultimate consideration of the Conval County Housing Association.”
This is a very difficult case, because their behavior is extremely extreme, and what they do will definitely make the neighbors fearful.
I am grateful for the work that my team has done, and I am also grateful for the DeVincourt and Conval County police, and for the community members who have courageously provided information to us.
I hope that this move will bring some comfort to the neighbors, and the message that we will never tolerate anti-social actions.
Mr. Fitzpatrick said their three sons lived in this house for different periods, but also said they were all over 20 years old.
After they were evacuated, one of the bedrooms was thrown on the floor of a dirty bed.
The housing association workers will soon clean up the stalls of waste around the house.
In 2014, the police searched the house, found more than 70 grams of marijuana, and found Tianjin, drug equipment and £1,700 cash.
After confession, Skeldon was sentenced to a fine for possession of drugs of category B and intention of trafficking in drugs.
She claims that the money was spent to buy a tomb for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
It is known that after home-free, Tanya and her husband now live in a private house in Plymouth.
The walls of the rooms are full of paintings.
The police said they would expel tenants who violated the rental rules.
Angela Crow, from the DeWin County and the Comwell County Police Department, said the expulsion was a clear warning to other renters who continued to violate the rental rules.
“This warning is aimed at those who think their behavior will not be accused, as well as those who are destroyed by this behavior,” she said.
The DeVincourt and the Comwell County Police Authority will never tolerate crime and anti-social acts, and they will continue to cooperate with partners to protect our community.
Reed: Hillary Will Nominate Gland to the Supreme Court
The Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said he was confident that if the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was elected president, she would nominate Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have stopped the confirmation of the country since Barack Obama's presidential nomination in March.
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said the next president will choose him to replace the deceased Supreme Court judge Antonin Scalia.
Reed said at a telephone meeting on Thursday that he predicted that Hillary would choose a "some reliable" Gland.
Reed’s spokeswoman then said that Reed was not just whether he would nominate Gland for a direct dialogue with Hillary, and said he was just guessing.
He greaterly appreciated Gland and said Hillary's team did not want to "interrupt" the new candidates.
Galland is the chief judge of the Federal Tour Appeal Court in the U.S. District of Columbia.
Reed said the Republicans who stopped Gland's nomination were the "pets" and "successors" of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump was not suitable for president.
“Treats”: Naked Calendar “Men and Women Love”
The Treats magazine will work with photographer David Bellemere to photograph a set of inspirations from the Pirelli calendar of the 1970s in 2017.
This time, they plan to look for a new generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses Calendar, rather than famous naked men.
Treats President Steve Shaw said earlier this year that their naked-driven magazines were different from the old-fashioned "Flowers" because "the latter was man-driven."
We are directed towards women.
Obviously, he believes that this group of calendar is the same.
“We need to show the eternal and classic nakedness that makes both women and men feel, and this time it is inspired by it,” Shaw said at a calendar presentation.
Women will be pleased to participate in this film because it is a beautiful artwork.
Models can submit photographic applications online, and they can also submit their applications personally to the public recruitment sites in Los Angeles and New York.

French court rejects petition to destroy shops in the Jungle Refugee Camp
A French court rejected the request by the Galey government to destroy dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the “Jungle” refugee camp, where thousands of refugees currently live.
In the court’s hearing this week, the Galey government argued that the French government should have the right to dismantle a total of 72 temporary shops in the refugee camp: people in these shops in the refugee camp sell goods including cigarettes to energy drinks, provide hairdressing services, and also in the temporary restaurants sell tea at a price of 50 cents (40 pounds) or basic foods at a price of several euros.
The Gulf Governor's Office believes these places should be dismantled because they are non-taxed parallel economies, and there are also fires and health risks.
Humanitarian groups said the courts that these shops and restaurants are extremely important because the free food supplied by the state-supported associations and other groups cannot at all meet the growing demand of the refugee camps.
They said these temporarily built shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for those in need.
A court ruled that there was no legal basis to expel the operators of the 72 temporary stores, but said Gale's concerns were "comprehensible".
Judge Jean-François Molla said the role of these food stores, cafes and restaurants is far more than simply providing food to those “living in extremely dangerous conditions”.
He said these places were a peaceful gathering between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened to be destroyed is the “Jungle Book Kids” cafe in the refugee camp, which offers 200 food, English and French lessons a day, and provides refuge advice to hundreds of unaccompanied vulnerable minors in the refugee camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the cafe.
In a letter to the Guardian, the closure of this cafe “will be a great catastrophe for these children (a lot of children are only eight years old).
Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, the two charity organizations, on Friday, predicted that the number of refugees in the jungle refugee camps has exceeded 9,000, the highest level since the sharp increase in the number of refugees in the summer.

The Australian Government of New South Wales announced on Wednesday that it will invest $200 million (approximately $1.54 billion) in the largest repair since the construction of the famous Sydney Opera House.
The government of New South Wales said the rebuilding would not change the appearance of the opera shell.

“Environmental problems are now on air, water, and soil pollution, but the roots are still on the way of life of production.”
For example, in 2015, the land development rate in Jiangsu province reached 21%, ranked the highest in the national province and autonomous region.
Therefore, the problems of high pollution, large energy, and multi-occupation have not yet received a fundamental response from the transformation of the production way of life.
On the one hand, the results of the creation of various types of ecological environments at all levels in Jiangsu province, with absolute advantage, are ranked first in the country; but on the other hand, the resource environment carries a great pressure.
To solidly promote the protection and governance of the ecological environment, it is necessary to fundamentally promote the transformation of the way of life in production and to promote the transformation of the beneficial life of the ecological civilization.

The project belongs to the mechanical processing enterprise, the initial emissions rights applicable are chemical oxygen demand (COD) 0.514 tons/year and amino nitrogen (NOX) 0.052 tons/year.
The right to air pollutants is paid to use and trade for the main industrial enterprises that supply electricity and thermal production throughout the city.
The existing deforestation unit which has received environmental assessment before 1 January 2016 has not been charged for a paid use fee.
"A paid right to discharge is not equal to the right to discharge illegally, it is not arbitrarily emitting pollutants."
Vice-Director of the Environmental Protection Bureau of Qingdao City, Han Red Yin, said that if unlawful discharge and excessive discharge are still to be punished in accordance with the relevant regulations, it is impossible to allow unlawful enterprises to avoid punishment by purchasing the right to discharge.
That is, by means of legal means to strictly fight environmental violations, to strictly punish the company’s excessive emissions, thereby protect the environment and ensure public health.
Now companies, for their own interests, have increased the motivation of pollution, appreciated limited emissions and reduced emissions of pollutants.
With economic interests driven, the reduction of emissions of pollutants turns from government compulsory behavior to business conscious market behavior, thus truly achieving the purpose of protecting the environment, protecting nature, and ensuring public health.
The right to emissions, also referred to as the "right to emissions", is the right to emissions of pollutants, which means the right of the emitter to emissions to the environment, within the amount distributed by the government, according to the law.
This right is essentially the right of the pollutants to possess, use and profit from environmental capacity resources.
The next step is to interconnect the emissions by means of a currency exchange between internal sources, provided that the total emissions of pollutants do not exceed the permissible emissions.
Since the introduction in 1968 by American economist Dales, in the 1970s, the US began to apply it to the management of air and river pollution sources.
China has launched its experimental tests since 2007, and currently 14 provinces (regions, cities) such as Zhejiang and Jiangsu are fully implemented.
According to the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, to help these six strategic bombers carry out aerial attack on the ISIS target in Syria, several Russian fighter aircraft supported the landing from the Syrian air base of Hmeimim.
On 22 February this year, the U.S. and Russia reached a ceasefire agreement on the sides in the Syrian conflict, and the ceasefire agreement began to enter into force on the 27th of that month.
According to the agreement, the ceasefire does not include military attacks on terrorist organizations recognised by the UN Security Council, such as the Islamic State and the “Support Front”.
Russia will continue to build relevant military infrastructure on the base and the living conditions of the Russian soldiers will be guaranteed.
He also said that if the extremist forces were not attacked, they would expand to Russia.
Although Russia and the West have not reached an agreement on jointly fighting the Syrian extremist forces, Russia will strengthen cooperation with Syria, Iran, Iraq and so on.
In September 2015, Russia, on the invitation of the Syrian government, began a military attack on the Syrian extremist forces.
On 15 March this year, the main Russian military forces in Syria began withdrawal, but the Russian side promised to continue to retain the air base in Hmeimim and the Navy base in Taltus.

In fact, the rural and urban relationships should be accompanied by each other, just like the mother and the child, without the strengths, without the need for anyone to rule who, should be very warm.
There is no fixed model of rural development, but it is hard to change by rural spontaneous changes, and the most important thing should be to let the right people go to the countryside.

Unfortunately, this phenomenon was not punished because of the people of the violators, the difficulty of proofing, etc., and the legal provisions were almost placed.
If the supervisory department can make a decision to “proclam war” to the driver’s phone playing behavior, to normalize this measure, such a violation of law will be restricted.

In the collective shelter in the East Lin village of Tahrir, the 48-year-old Wang Shephen is bringing the workers to spray pesticides to the peanut tree.
The whole village has 150 hectares of fruit garden, more than 10 trees, only 12 workers and one technical engineer are needed.
A total of $50,000 last year, like my age, would not get that money if I worked in the factory.
Last year, the East Lin village level income reached 22 million, of which the total agricultural income accounts for almost half.
Village Secretary Suzie Feng: The per capita land cultivation area is increasing annually, just starting 50 hectares, now has more than 100 hectares; the per hectare efficiency is increasing annually, the income of the professional farmers is also growing annually.
The main point of the reform of the Sunan rural collective economy is to clarify the property rights of the rural collective business and to explore the political and economic separation.
In July 2015, 14 rural economic cooperation organizations and the countryside countryside countryside countryside countryside countryside countryside countryside countryside countryside countryside countryside countryside countryside countryside countryside countryside countryside countryside countryside countryside.
The two institutions have two accounts, not "frontiers" with each other, and prevent the village executives from participating in the collective asset management of the corruption phenomenon.
The Deputy Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Agriculture Committee, Xi Jinping, said that the next step in Jiangsu will continue to promote the reform of the community shares cooperation system, encourage agricultors' joint development and establish a democratic power operation mechanism on the rural level.
To further advance the reform, to engage in community share cooperation, to quantitate the assets to the employees, to fix the farmers, and to form clear property rights.
Through the Internet+, the implementation of his right of knowledge, the right of participation in decision-making and the right of supervision of democratic management, the three rights implemented to the farmers, indeed made it a standard operating mechanism of share cooperation.
Currently, the new collective economy in the suburban suburban suburban suburban suburban suburban suburban suburban suburban suburban suburban suburban suburban suburban suburban suburban suburban suburban suburban suburban suburban suburban suburban suburban.

Xiamen girl Zhang Bing: "Hand-style beautiful" begins shooting road career a few times "reversed"
A few days ago, Xiamen Xi'an's East Park Village's Zhang East Red just put 29 inches old TV in the house, replaced it with 65 inches big TV.
The normal farmer's daughter is Zhang Bing, who won the Chinese gold medal for the Rio Olympics women's 50m gun.
On the 11th night, just before this new television, the Zhang East Red couple and dozens of relatives and good friends, together witnessed the daughter’s journey to struggle straight, from almost pre-competition to the magical process of almost reversal.
In the match that day, Zhang Bing once down in the ranking, it seems far from the final.
But the parents and relatives and good friends did not give up, constantly pressing the text live, seeing with the other players finish, Zhang Bing named one way up, eventually locked the final seat, his house shut down when exploded from a moment of joy.
In the final, Zhang Bing was once behind the ranking, the last few shots were more and more stable, only with the behind-the-counter championship 0.2 runs score won the silver medal.
This year, already 27-year-old Zhang Bing, in the 16 years of shooting career, in fact, several times has almost wiped up with this hardly coming silver medal.
Her mother, Zhang Xiaoong, told reporters that just when they hesitated, Zhang Bing found a few “roman guests” from the village.
These "roman guests" were the same village children who were recommended at the same time in the year to participate in the training, including Zhang Bing's cousin.
Just shortly after entering the Xiamen team, Zhang Bing once again, due to family difficulties and other reasons, initially returned to the Yuan school to study.
But after his illumination coach Zhang Ajer repeatedly worked, Zhang Bing back to the Xiamen team.
And after entering the province, Zhang Bing was once again unable to enter the national team because of delay, once again home because of not seeing hope.
This time, not only Zhang Ajer coach, Xiamen shooting shooter sport center and Fujin province team's leadership and coach came home, eventually convincing Zhang Bing back to the province team.
Like yesterday’s match, this Xiamen girl’s persistence achieved a reversal on the way of shooting.
“Every coach has a different way of choosing a team member, when I saw the hands of Bingo look very beautiful, it was instantly in the middle.
Zhang East Red also recalled that in the training tests, the daughter, although the performance is not the best, but the number of rings played is stable, this is also the important reason why Zhang Bing attracts the coach.
In the course of the training of Zhang Bing, Zhang Ajax was the most impressed, the investment of this farm girl.
He recalled that Zhang Bing came into the Xiamen shooting team more than a year later, the team performed a permanent shooting training, requiring the team members for half an hour not to move.
Zhang Xiaoong told reporters that his daughter has always been a quiet and gentle child, and since childhood she loved painting and self-made toys.
“I’m going to make clothes at home, make clothes, make clothes, and I’m going to get some side corners to make a doll.”
She said her daughter would often make her own hands-on toys, along with her good painting, from the pet officer of the doll to the costume, she could always make her look good.
As an athlete, Zhang Bing and his family are more separated, only on holidays can go home, often more by telephone contact.
The parents said, whether to meet or call, Zhang Bing rarely talks about his hard work, more about talking about something fun with his parents.
Often they don’t see their daughters, the parents in the house carefully retain their daughters’ paintings and year-round honors.
Zhang Xiaoong showed her daughter’s animated cartoon to the journalists, “if she wasn’t a shooter, she should continue to paint.”
And in the living room on the second floor of Zhang Bing, there was a closet filled with the medals, medals and certificates she received.
Zhang East Red placed the medals and medals in order, and the certificate was unified and placed in the folder preserved, "These are the honour that has been changed by the heart for decades, we all appreciate it.
In recent days, the Hanoi Province Charity Fund has sent 16,000 yuan of compassion to the hands of six lost family households in the small works of the Hanoi County, Taipei, Guangzhou and other villages.
This is another compassion for the fund to the community after the revelation of the “7.19 flood missing young children and lonely elderly” was sent.
7.19 Strong rainfall caused many districts in Hanoi, causing flooding disasters in some areas of the province, and the deaths and disappearances of people.
The good man "Old Iron" was unfortunate because of helping the small district's duty to discharge, leaving a 2-year-old boy and his wife, the good man "Old Iron" sensitive events attracted the entire province.
On 4 August, Hanoi Province Charity Fund staff and Hanoi Brand Association volunteers came together to the good man’s “Old Iron” home, delivering 3,200 yuan love money to the family’s “Old Iron” hands.
When the brand association vice president Yeli learned about the current situation of the “Old Iron” family, he immediately decided to conduct the “Love and Love Sales” activity among the brand association’s business members, helping the “Old Iron” family to deal with difficulties.
The Hanoi Province Charity Fund, fully known as the Hanoi Province Volunteer Service Foundation and Charity Fund, was launched by the Hanoi Brand Association Organization Committee and was established in August 2015.
According to the Hong Kong "Eastern Daily" on August 12, the current domestic diamond sales are said to have three major problems, including the netth of the fake diamond pushing the sales price, the weight of the fake diamond, and no after-sales guarantee.
And Antwerp is one of the world’s largest diamond trading centers, the local craftsmen’s diamond cutting technology is famous, the diamond sold has been rigorously certified and is deeply welcomed by the indigenous women.
“A small bag, held in the hand, lightly floating a small piece, worth a million dollars,” Liu’s grandmother, who was involved in the purchase of diamonds, described to the Indian media her experience in June this year at Antwerp.
She indicates herself hiding the diamonds in the underwear, taking them to the toilet for a few days in a row, bathing, and walking and sleeping is very nervous.
She said that the diamonds purchased at Antwerp, the price of the purchase was approximately $50,000 per crawl, and the quality of the diamonds in Xiamen, the retail price was approximately $11,000 per crawl.
She sold all the diamonds that she had purchased, and earned twenty thousand dollars.
According to the domestic customs regulations, diamonds are not passengers in the journey of goods or necessary items, therefore belong to the category of goods, when entering the country must be declared, otherwise or listed as trafficking, the situation can be seriously sentenced to prison.
According to foreign media, on 10 local time, the British Prime Minister's House in Donning Street announced that British Prime Minister Theresa May will spend summer holidays in Switzerland, but no specific holidays were revealed.
According to the media, after the Brexit referendum, the new British Prime Minister chose to go on a "neutral" Switzerland holiday on the European continent, with some kind of policy symbolism.
The Guardian commented that the symbolicity represented by Switzerland, a neutral state, played a role in the choice of the British Prime Minister’s first holiday place.
The Daily Telegraph commented that Theresa May chose to go on a holiday in Switzerland, the first time after Mrs. Thatcher had a new British prime minister to go on a holiday in Switzerland.
The choice of the two women's prime ministers and the choice of the two men's prime ministers, Blair and Cameron, prefer to go to a hotest place for vacation.

China’s Mars Plan has arrived.
Our Mars detection missions are to be accomplished once around, landing, and touring, this form has never existed abroad.
Our Mars detection launch objective is to seek a step around, landing, touring, this mission has a considerable difficulty.
Since Mars detection takes 26 months to encounter a time window, experts are developing a rigorous engineering plan to launch our first Mars detector in 2020.
Although China’s aircraft have already entered the deep space, the completion of the Mars detection mission is still indispensable, and the Mars detection means that China is actually entering the deep space detection era.
“Every two or three years, Mars has the nearest chance to launch a Mars detector at this time, which is the most energy-saving one for the carrier rocket.
"Given the quality of the Mars detector, the missile will be carried by China's Long Journey 5 to complete the launch mission."
Our Mars detection mission is to one time realize the circumference, landing, touring, this form has never existed abroad, abroad has planned one time to realize the circumference and landing, but the landing failed.
Mars detection involves a lot of technological fields, especially that although Mars is a space detector, it has clear features compared to a general space detector.
That is, the Mars detector should have the ability to determine the route and detect the dangers of obstacles.
The Chinese Space and Technology Group’s Five Academy researcher, Pong Xiao, said that the reason why humanity is so preferred to Mars discovery is because Mars discovery has important science, technology and many aspects of significance, and even relates to the future of humanity.
Currently, Mars has become the highest level of human research outside of Earth, and the history of human space detectors to explore Mars has almost enlarged the entire human space history.
Therefore, mankind hopes one day to build a residential base on Mars and eventually migrate to Mars, making it the second home of mankind.
Large numbers of signs also show that Mars is likely to be the same as the present Earth before, only after several billion years of evolution, the atmosphere becomes weak, low temperatures, and water sources are exhausted.
Therefore, research on the detection or human landing of Mars can provide forecasts to prevent Earth from becoming the second Mars that is difficult to survive by humans.
By June 2016, a total of 114 moon observations and 43 Mars observations were carried out worldwide.
However, from the 1990s to today, humans have done 18 Mars observations, while the moon observations have only been done 14 times.
There are currently five Mars orbiters and two Mars routers working, but only one Moon orbiters and one Moon landers are working.
The world’s space forces have developed a plan of detection targeting the Mars system, which shows that today’s Mars detection is more hot than the Moon detection.
On November 5, 2013, India launched the first Mars spacecraft "Mangarian", becoming the first Asian country to successfully detect Mars.
The Mangarian is used to study the surface, atmosphere and mineral characteristics of Mars, to explore whether there are methane and signs of life on Mars.
The hardest place for this mission is that the detector has only one chance to get into the atmosphere of Mars after the atmospheric appearance and landing slope.
According to Sun Zhejiang, Mars Detector General Designer of the Chinese Space and Technology Group's Five House General Department, Mars Detection Mission faces many technological challenges.
The atmospheric pressure on Mars is low, with only 1% of Earth's surface atmospheric pressure with high uncertainty.
Factors related to its changes and the characteristics of the storm, scientists have not yet a thorough understanding.
Mars often forms a dust similar to Earth's dust weather in the summer, which will lead to a drastic decline in the solar energy received by the Mars car, and it must design a "sleep" mode for the Mars car, allowing it to wait patiently for the dust to pass.
At the same time, the atmosphere on Mars also reduces the effect of sunlight, which makes it difficult for the energy supply that Mars detects.
This requires a larger area of the solar wings of the detector, and it needs to be constantly adjusted, trying to address the direction of the sun.
Moreover, Mars’s surface gravity is only 38% of Earth, but it’s greater than the moon’s surface gravity, so the detector needs greater power.
"This Mars detection mission's core and most difficult place is the detector's post-Mars atmosphere atmospheric appearance and landing acceleration process, only one chance, must be guaranteed to succeed.
Sun Zhejiang said that because the Earth is far from Mars, the whole process cannot be controlled by the Earth in real time, so it is necessary to rely on the detector to do it independently.
Because there are not so many drivers to compensate for such a high speed, when landing on Mars, the slowdown depends on the role of the Mars atmosphere, however, the Mars atmosphere is difficult to simulate on the ground.
In general, the way of detecting Mars is similar to the way of detecting the moon, it is also “rotating, falling, rotating, rotating”, ultimately achieving the target of human landing on Mars.
Since Mars is far from Earth than the moon is far from Earth, the detection of Mars requires a series of more complex technological difficulties.
According to Taiwan media reports, Taiwan’s “Administrative Director” Lin All announced yesterday morning that “political parties and their associated organizations have improperly obtained property processing regulations” from today into force.
National Party Vice-President Jean-Yu-Wing said, “A National Party with more than a hundred years of history, with a society’s commitment and responsibility, will not fall so.”
He emphasized that if political parties, associated organizations or trusted administrators violate the provisions of prohibited penalties, the committee will investigate and "in accordance with the law" punish and punish.
Lin Chen also announced the incorrect election of the Deputy Chairman of the Party Production Committee, which will be held by Taiwan’s “Lim Government Agency Deputy Chairman” Hong Baken.
He said that the chairman of the unfair party production committee was not elected by two people, and that Hong Baker's past experience of investigating the relevant major cases would be the basis for the committee to investigate the relevant unfair party production cases.
Jan Yuan believes that today, as long as there is a party product, no one will give you social donations, if the party product total is fully collected, the National Party can just ask for social support and sponsorship, "Today really there is no chance to go."
Jian Yuan also emphasized that even after the wrong party production regulations on the way, the national party product has not been fully filled and confiscated, the rest will still be under the promise to donate out, allow the party product to be zero, and the party wants everything to start from zero.
The original title: "The Corridor Doctor" Lancashire calls central vision chairman Wang Xi'an's honor infringement first trial
The law system evening news due to the speech of the CBS chairman Wang Xi'an on New Wave Microblog against the "corridor doctor" incident, Lancashire appealed Wang Xi'an and Beijing Micro Dream Innovation Network Technology Limited to the court.
Yesterday afternoon, the Haidian Court issued a judgment on the case, ruling that Wang Xi An and Microme Company did not constitute a violation of the rights, rejecting the entire lawsuit request of Lancashire.
Earlier 2014, the CBS journalist Wang Xi'an investigation found that, despite the 600 days of sitting in the hospital corridor, the Lanzhou Peak was shaped by the media as a sad hero under the institutional pressure, the reports contained a lot of false information.
On March 29, 2014, the "Corridor Doctor" program was broadcast by CBS News Survey.
The various so-called over-medical information that Lancashire has to the media, has no evidence supported.
Wang Xi'an also describes in a microblog of real name accreditation, "the reason why Lancashire is going to this step is character making, it has a clear paranoid personality, etc."
The Lancashire proposed to ask Wang Xi'an to remove the microblog, apologize to it and compensate for mental damage with a compensation of 100,000.
During the trial, the two sides debated whether Wang Xi'an violated the honorary right of Lante Peak.
Next Next post: The Chinese team is busy with four bicycles hoping for a breakthrough
The bicycle is expected to the Olympic gold medal "zero breakthrough", while the female soccer girl will challenge the two-time world championship winner team Germany, waiting for a cold blow to the top four.
The state of Wang Town two seasons highlighted, last year Beijing Tandy World Championship earned a silver medal, and this year in May group competition world championship again upgraded the personal project championship.
According to foreign media reports, the 27-year-old Korean shooter, Zhang Yu Jin, won the gold medal in the women shooter personal competition, after the group competition again won the Olympic gold medal, becoming the double crown.
Zhang Zhang is considered a late-made player, she has regretted not getting the ticket for the last London Olympics, but now stands proudly on the highest prize stand for the Rio Olympics.
Zhang Eugene won the gold medal in the women's shooting personal final held at the Rio de Janeiro Stadium in Brazil, with a total score of 6-2 defeating Germany's Lisa Unru.
She was the first to shoot in the fourth grade of primary school, until she was 27 years old, she won the first personal gold medal in the 2014 World Cup, a famous later player.
Zhang Yi Jin recalled, "There was no level before high school, so that he could not participate in the national competition.
Zhang Hyejin won the fourth place in the Olympic Championship in London four years ago, unfortunately losing the Olympic entrance ticket, only sitting to watch his colleague and good friend Chivou twice to win two gold medals.
In the end of the women's shooting personal award ceremony, Zhang Wijin talked about his earning sense, "until the end were as much as possible one shot and one shot, maybe this brought a good result, and he was satisfied.
The 28-year-old Korean shooter "One Sister" and London Olympics shooter personal gold medal winner Chivou has won a bronze medal.
Chevrolet defeated in the semi-finals to Zhang Hyejin, starting a bronze medal competition with Mexican player Aril Hangdela Valencia.
Chevrolet twice sinked the field after assuring the bronze medal, where the silently suffered deposit burden can be imagined.

Although it has not yet been confirmed, many sources have said that Apple’s autumn 2016 release will take place in September and the iPhone 7 is really coming.
Although Apple has not responded, news about the features and configurations of the new iPhone has been released, even on the internet even the iPhone 7 “real machine model” images have been released.
The new generation of the iPhone can be called “all-looking”, hot, tight, money-free ... if you want to buy the original first time, you must choose a good channel, for example, Suning.
This worsened people’s disappointment about the new phone, “It’s extended, but it can’t project a full-fledged image at all!
iPhone 7, like other iPhones, is accompanied by countless secrets before birth.
Additionally, several sources claim that the new generation of iPhone will cancel the 3.5mm headset interface, instead of using the Bluetooth connection and charging interface, which will provide space for Apple to add the second speaker.
Another evidence that can prove this is that Apple has already allowed the headset manufacturers to produce headset products that are connected through a charging interface in 2014.
These news, whether true or false, will be revealed until Apple’s autumn 2016 release.
But this does not prevent people in the industry from looking at the iPhone 7 prospects – many believe that the iPhone 7 is likely to be Apple’s last major upgrade to the iPhone series.
Although according to recent data published by the market research agency IDC, the market share of the iPhone has decreased.
Of these, Goldman Sachsins Apple’s shares in the “buy” ranking, while BMO analysts believe the iPhone 7 will gain a historic sales score.
Hock Tan, CEO of Boeing, also said that Apple’s future revenue growth is likely to be more than 20 percent due to the launch of the iPhone 7.
7% of respondents said they intended to buy the iPhone 7, while only 4% of those who intended to buy the iPhone 6 two years ago.
It is known that 20 percent of users currently holding iPhone 6 or 6Plus are planning to buy iPhone 7, which is a fairly high percentage.
Second, there are experts analyzing that most fruit powder likes to isolate replacing their iPhone phones.
According to statistics, about 26% of all iPhone users have not replaced their phones for 2 years, which is about 1.2 million iPhone users have been using for 2 years.
According to the media, Taiwan has suffered several earthquakes during the production of the iPhone 7, "the degradation of the power supply facility is beyond imagination, and it is likely to have an impact on the early supply of the iPhone 7.
The demand contradictions will affect the ordinary user, it’s time to choose a good channel, the first time low price to get the original iPhone 7.
According to informed persons, in recent years, Suning’s senior staff has frequently met with Apple, with the aim of preparing sufficient supplies.
Operators have negotiated with Suning, and it can be predicted that with the deep cooperation of the two sides, it will inevitably bring lower prices and more affordable services to users.
“The lowest price, consumers might ‘cost only $7 a day, can buy the iPhone 7’”
A sufficient supply and a variety of offers, allowing the purchase of the iPhone 7 to be no longer “pressure mountain”, and Suning’s logistics, more will turn this beauty into a more intuitive sense of experience.
Maybe you’ll get the phone in the middle of the night, “Hello, Sunin is easy to buy, your iPhone 7 is coming.”
The organizers want to help local people learn more about the historic Chinese culture through the Cultural Exhibition, thus enhancing mutual understanding and friendship between the people of the two countries.
Barcelona’s “Modern Heritage Exhibition” is part of the European tour, which will last until the beginning of October.

According to foreign media reports, due to the jumping water pool water from blue to green, the Rio Olympics "green pool" event has recently gained attention from the outside world.
However, on the 10th morning, the water of the waterball match pool near the jumping pool also became green.
After the Australian waterball player said his eyes were painful and wanted to flow tears.
Earlier, Rio Olympics officials confirmed the condition of the pool water becoming green, and said the pool water color changes are due to alkaline weakness and will not affect the health of the athletes.
But the Australian athlete said his eyes were sick after winning a match with the Japanese team in the waterball pool.
The first after the jumping pool water became green, the competition hosts overtime deal with the problem of the jumping pool on the 9th night, but on the 10th morning they found the water pool color also changed rapidly.
During the match between the Australian team and the Japanese team, the environmental conditions in the aquaculture have gradually deteriorated, but the official emphasis is that they will restore the water quality of the two swimming pools to their original color on 11th.
Mario Andrada, a spokesman for the Rio Olympics, said: “Today afternoon, the level of alkalistic water in the jumping pool was first weakened.
“We’ve learned a number of reasons that may cause water color change and water quality content.”
The water sports center conducted a series of water quality tests, hundreds of swimmers and swimmers used the swimming pool to determine the water quality conditions to meet the standard.
“These days we’ve been going through normal processes, but we may ignore the more athletes are likely to have an impact on the water quality.
“But the change in water color is definitely no effect on the body’s health, especially on the athletes.”
“This independent team confirmed our assessment and confirmed the measures we took to restore the normal colour and chemical condition of the pool.
“We had hoped that the swimming pool would return to normal color in the morning, but the speed of recovery was affected because of the rain.

Urumqi regulates tourist tourist market operating order travel agencies must sign contracts with tourists
Currently Xinjiang has entered the tourism season, to regulate the operating order of the tourist tourist market, Urumqi City Tourism Law Enforcement Branch United City Operating Bureau Law Enforcement Branch yesterday on the tourist vehicles existing in the tourist market unregulated, travel agencies and tourists signed contracts with a low rate of issues to investigate.
At eight a.m. yesterday morning, about 10 buses were stopped around the Cabinsky Hotel, most of which were travellers on a day trip to the Sky Pool.
“Hello, I am from Urumqi City Tourism Bureau, have you signed a contract with this travel agency?”
Urumqi City Operations Authority Law Enforcement Branch staff Zhu Bin introduced: "External tourist vehicles and buses operate tourist passenger transport projects in Urumqi market, no practice qualification.
“Over-range operations against this punishment of three to a hundred thousand, driver without a practice qualification is a fine of 2,000 yuan.”
It is known that previously the tourism law enforcement department of Urumqi City has inspected the places where tourists are concentrated in the West Park, Red Mountains and others.
Comprehensive two inspections, Urumqi City Tourism Law Enforcement Branch Deputy Captain Machi said: "The first is safety, the second is standard, tourism vehicles are no small thing, once the problem comes, they are crowded injured.
“We and the operators jointly conduct continuous inspections of the market, regulating travel social vehicle behavior ensuring tourists safe.
The press office of the Council of Ministers held a press conference on the operation of the national economy in July 2016.
A spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics and the Director of the National Economy Comprehensive Statistics Department said that in July, the growth rate of part of the national economy was slowed, but still operates in a reasonable range.
The data published by the National Bureau of Statistics shows that the rate of growth of fixed asset investments and the total imports in July has fallen.
As for the national economy’s operation in July, I would like to borrow the phrase that the Prime Minister once said “formal volatility, the trend is still good”, which can better summarize the characteristics of the economic operation in July.
He explained that "physical volatility" means that some economic indicators have actually fallen back in July.
Since the domestic and foreign economies are still in a deep adjustment in July, the international situation is complex and changing, the recovery of the world economy is less than expected, the export pressure is still relatively large.
From the domestic point of view, the entire economy is still in a critical phase of adjustment, the pain of adjustment is released, the economy is faced with a little downward pressure, so some indicators are somewhat volatile.
In July, there was a special situation, the flood catastrophes were more severe and the warm weather had some impact on the production operations in some regions.
According to the recent report published by the Ministry of Civil Affairs, more than 60 million people in the country have been affected, with direct economic losses of more than 200 billion yuan.
From the industry, investment and transport-related indicators, these areas are affected in different degrees.
The weekly shipping rate in July dropped 3.6 percent points compared to last month, and the flood has some impact on the traffic in these areas.
In terms of these factors, some variations in the indicators in July are both normal and expected.
He said that "the trend is still good" means that despite the decline in economic growth, the overall economic operation is stable, stable, stable, stable, stable, stable, stable, stable, stable and stable.
In July, the CPI increased 1.8%, the round ratio increased 0.2%; in July, the CPI increased 2.1%, so the overall price situation is stable.
According to the portal network of the Chongqing City Meteorological Bureau on the statistics of the high temperature weather in various districts, in addition to Chongqing Sun, the rest of the city can receive high temperature grants to different degrees.
Currently, at least 28 provinces in the country have cleared the standards of granting, but the standards of granting in each province are different, while Chongqing is the way of receiving high temperature grant according to the high temperature work day grant.
If 35°C or less than 37°C, it is not less than 10 yuan per person per day; if 37°C or more, it is not less than 15 yuan per person per day.
High temperature workers above 40°C may receive a monthly allowance of up to 20 yuan/day (except for workers who have already received a high temperature job allowance according to the law).
According to this standard, last month the high-temperature weather days in Cairo can get to 330 yuan, the smallest number of days in the city is 80 yuan, and the high-temperature is due to not reaching the high-temperature standard, so there is no high-temperature subsidy.
In the past, many units will be dealing with high-temperature subsidies with clean drinks, and the City Safety Authority said this act is not in accordance with the current method.
If the work stops or the working time is shortened due to high temperatures, the employee unit shall not discount or reduce the wages of the workers.
The City People's Society said that employees who encountered high-temperature work but did not receive high-temperature grants, can struggle for legitimate rights and interests through the employment dispute mediation agency where the company is located, or call 12333 complaints.
If the utility unit refuses to issue high-temperature grants, the worker may complain to the responsible department for human resources and social security at the level of the countryside where the employee is located.
At the same time, because high heat subsidies are part of wages, not benefits, they must be included in the total wages and tax deductions.
Therefore, high heat subsidies are not within the minimum wage scope, must be issued in the form of cash and cannot be replaced by physical substances such as beverages.

The official operation of Urumqi New Passenger Station will become an important platform for the construction of a national comprehensive transport city in Xinjiang, promoting the "Silk Road Economic Belt" and the construction of a new area.
Grecia is a generous female mouth bird that breaks the breath of the tropical rainforest.
In the Central American country of Costa Rica, the big mouth bird Grecia and its story have been familiar for a long time.
At a press conference on August 10, the post-operative recovery Grace finally appeared, showing people its new 3D printed plastic bird.
This only a year and a half ago was broken by people, the big mouth bird, and now finally re-born.
This day not only announces it’s 100% recovered, but also the day it’s moved to a luxury bird house, to meet with human friends careful for it.
Gresia, who began to enter the new house, was a little swallowed, but soon became vibrant, wandered in the waters, and eaten wheat with the new wheat.
To remind people that it had suffered any damage, the technicians did not give it a new color, but retained the original white of the 3D printing material.
The bird is a layer of thin corneal corneal corneal corneal corneal corneal corneal corneal corneal corneal corneal corneal corneal corneal corneal corneal.
Although there is this internal reinforcement component, the bulk of the big mouth bird is still vulnerable and is broken when injured.
The Animal Rescue Center, bird scientists and a U.S. 3D printing company have worked together to produce a number of “test spots” for Grace and finally create the best “perfect spots” for her.
Today, Grecia has been able to know how to use new peppers to drink water, eat food, and even make small grains.
The design of the finished product took about 2 months, printing it only took 4 or 5 hours.
“3D printing is not the future technology, it’s actually going into your life,” said Thomas Lang, chairman of the US SG3D printing company, in an interview with New China International Reporter.
In January 2015, in a farm in Grazia, in the central province of Aragua, in Costa Rica, a blood-floor giant bird Grazia was discovered.
At that time it was brutally broken by a group of young men, it was completely unable to eat and life was in danger.
The tragic situation in Grecia, according to the media, has led to a flooding opposition to animal abuse inside and outside Costa Rica.
They demand more strict animal protection laws and increased punishment for abuse.
People come spontaneously and make their best to help Grace restore her life before her injury as much as possible.
Even the 3D printing technology inventor, Chuck Hell, was also involved in the design of Grazia.
“Grecia’s situation is very special, the remainder of its upper coat is less than 1 cm, so it brings a lot of difficulty to install the new coat.
“We first scan the Grecia, then design and manufacture a prolonged phosphorus that is a little longer than the remaining part of it, fixed with glue on the top of it.
“This can reduce the further invasive sexual injury caused to Grecia,” Langer told New China International Reporter.
Prior to the installation of the fox, staff had to clean the grass every day in order to prevent infection.
A thousand miles away, the story of the big mouth bird Grecia fascinated the famous documentary director Tula Eredia and the exploration news channel producer John Hoffman.
They recorded the point drop in the process of Grazia installing Newton, and recorded a documentary "The Country of the Big Mouths", which was broadcast on the Animal Planet Channel this month.
The documentary “The Country of the Big Mouth Birds” shows people how a small big mouth bird makes a country change for it, and how it makes people engage in the opposition to animal abuse.
Core tip: Japanese oil companies are especially alert to the rise of China’s small independent refinery, known as “the tea cup”.
Japan’s largest oil company, JX Energy, believes that “the expansion of China’s exports is one of the reasons for the poor situation.
Japanese oil companies are alert to the rise of China’s small independent refinery, known as “the tea cup”.
China’s quality of oil products is gradually getting closer to Japan’s oil products due to China’s government’s strengthened environmental regulations.
Prior to obtaining the import permission, the “Tea Bottle Refinery” generally imports high sulfur content of heavy oil from Russia and other countries for refining.
Produced oil products have a high sulphur content, the oil is poor, becoming one of the causes of environmental pollution.
After obtaining the import permission, the tea cup refinery could import low sulphuric Oman crude oil and Russian crude oil, and the quality of its oil products was also improved.
“As the quality standards of oil products in China are constantly improving, the capacity of refining equipment is also improving.
As a result, the quality of oil products exported by China to the foreign countries has gradually reached the same level as (the world’s highest quality) Japan.”
JX Energy said, “After the end of 2015, China began to export high-quality light oil to Australia,” creating competition with Japanese products in the Asian market.
Although "Japan's high-quality oil" is facing a crisis, the response strategy taken by Japanese oil companies is only for "exporting to profitable areas while focusing on market conditions."
Due to the huge impact of oil products exported by China on the behavior of the Asian market, the attention of the tea cup refiners is increasingly high.

Ultraviolet not only makes the skin of the students black, it will more hurt the skin, how can the skin be able to successfully pass military training, not hurt?
Sunscreen packaging is typically marked with SPF and PA, SPF is indicating the sun protection index, is aimed at UVB UV, our common SPF index is 15, 30, 50 and so on.
The PA-marked products are intended for UVA, so the sunproofers will play a more effective role, usually in the case, the PA's intensity is + to indicate more than one + to indicate an extension of the effective protection time.
Oiled skin should choose waterproofs with strong penetration, and sunproof spray is also a good choice.
Dry skin should choose cream-shaped sun protection products; neutral skin generally has no strict regulations, sensitive skin drying on any maintenance is a burden, it is recommended to choose pure physical sun protection products.
Remember to paint a sun cream half an hour in advance, as sun protection products take time to fully penetrate the skin.
The military training sunshine time is long, the sun protection cream is washed once every two hours to have a lasting effect, don't cheat.
Because the skin is just so excited by the sun, military training does not return to use white products immediately.
After military training exposure, if conditional can be packed with a handheld with ice to the burned skin of the ice town to slow the local dry heat.
Farmers who buy agricultural machinery during the exhibition, continue to implement accumulated subsidy policies, farmers buy agricultural machinery can get a maximum of 40% subsidy.
This exhibition is aimed at global contractors, especially increasing the invitation intensity to the countries along the "Belt and Road" line and the target market countries.
This exhibition aims to complete 60 contractual projects, introduce funds of 22 billion yuan, sign more than 160 trade contracts, and the contract amount of 3.2 billion yuan.
It is that the "Shōboya" has been underway for seven consecutive years, due to the strong manufacturing industry base in the province of Hunan, Hunan, and the long history of industrial development.
As the host of the “Shoboy Meeting”, Turkey has established trade relations with more than 90 countries around the world.
“Shoboy” became an important platform for local cultivation of characteristic industry development and promoting characteristic industry out of the country’s gateway.
In some nights, the ion layer is filled with free electrons, which means that the radio signals can go further.
According to the U.S. Public Science Monthly website on August 11, the U.S. Air Force is interested in copying this effect.
While the ionic layer with a stable large amount of free electron can help people listen to the radio on the broadcast range edge of a university radio station, that may not be where the U.S. Air Force is interested.
The electron-filled ion layer means that the radio used by the military has a greater broadcast range, and it may provide some protection to the Global Positioning System (GPS) signals, making it free from the effects of the solar storm.
The final goal may be to build a series of cubic satellites according to demand, which can strengthen the ion layer when needed.
But first of all, the teams that have signed contracts with the Air Force must prove that the scientific principles in question will work.
Industry data show that the total capacity of coal production in 2015 reached 6 billion tons, and the national coal production capacity exceeds 1.8 billion tons.
Over the past decade, the Council of Ministers has previously issued five notifications on the elimination of excess and departure of production capacity.
Although the first four times did not target the coal industry, the target industry had a direct relationship with the coal industry.
From November last year to January of this year, Qingdao’s 5,500-carbon powered coal prices have long runned at a low level of 370 yuan/ton, with 90% of coal enterprises in losses.
Since February, the coal price has gradually risen, and the recent Qingdao Dynamic Coal price has increased four rounds in a row, rising to the highest point in 16 months, once rising to 436 yuan per ton, rising almost 70 yuan from the beginning of the year.
As the prices rise, all the sectors are concerned about this: will a small group of coal mines re-work?
This was analyzed and interpreted by China (Hainan) Reform and Development Institute's Director of the Economic Institute of China (Hainan).
Chongqing: The production capacity has attracted high attention from all sides, and the outcome list for the production capacity of the coal industry published today also makes everyone feel more concerned.
These three superficial factors reflect the reason that our growth mode has changed relatively back in the past, and that the government-dominated growth mode has not yet been substantially changed.
Second, this is also directly related to the advancement of local governments, and in the process of reducing production capacity, funds and corresponding support measures are to be made available, in this regard, the differences in the different regions are actually relatively large.
Thirdly, if some of the provinces that are currently slowly moving forward in the second half of the year, they may face a greater risk.
In this case, the process of relying on central remuneration funds to advance production capacity may have a certain negative impact.
First of all, the production capacity is not easy to control the total volume.
Our goal is to advance the optimization of the structure and rebuild the entire coal industry by eliminating the behind-the-coal production capacity.
In the process of deploying the production capacity, local governments must combine the transformation upgrade of the production capacity and the coal industry, and strongly develop the related service industry.
Second, in order to complete this year’s production capacity task, we still have to fully deploy the power of administrative supervision and administrative supervision.
Finally, we need to strengthen the fundamental role of social security.
Since the market directly involves employment issues, we need to strengthen employment skills training for employees and employees.
The reason for the decline is the expansion of foreign investments in Brazil’s GDP growth in the medium term.
In 2015, Brazil’s participation in global direct investments was 3.7%, less than 5.7% in 2014.
The International Investment Attractiveness Index includes four points: infrastructure, economic prospects, business environment and direct investment.
In 2015, Brazil's international direct investment was $64.6 billion, less than $73.1 billion in 2014.
Last year, the “green-ground” investment in Brazil (the investment model for foreign investment facilities) was $17.9 billion, which was a 2.1% decrease.
“There are 288 ‘green-ground investment’ projects in Brazil, with an annual average of 314 between 2003 and 2014.
However, in the first half of 2016, international direct investment in Brazil has reached $33.8 billion, which is 10 percent higher than the same period last year.
Previous Previous post: Canadian police kill ISIS supporters: self-made bomb attack preparation is close
The taxi company said the taxi was transferred to the Driver's house before the police arrived.
The police said in a press conference on Wednesday that the information received by the police included a "cable video" provided by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation about the young man who is going to carry out the attack.
According to the German Voice, on the screen, a man wearing a black barraclave hat is reading the Qur’an, referring to the crimes against Muslims, and sworn to attack a city in Canada soon.
In the video, he said the attack will take place within 72 hours and is at a peak time.
The incident was the first time after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau arrived in office last year, when police killed terror suspects before the incident.
After the upgrading of the reform, the Kyunghai Canal Chongqing Shipping Line, Old Vang Fu River and North Dai Shipping Line will be charged passing fees from 1 September.
The two shipping routes take the way of social funding for the reform of the construction, and the fees have been approved by the relevant departments of the province government.
The Old Vang Fu River navigation route flows through Qingdao and Fish Towers, through the South Sun Lake to the main navigation route of the Kyung Hang Canal, a total length of 32.5 km.
According to the navigation needs, the Old Vang Fu River navigation route took the way of maintenance transformation, the local water depth was deepened, the local accelerated curvation was made for curvation, and so on, the navigation conditions were improved.
The trail flows through the Qingdao County, Nong City District, through the South Sun Lake to the Main Trail of the Qingdao Canal, a total length of 19 km.
The transformation of the two routes began in February 2011 and the construction was completed in January 2015 and the investment construction and operating subject was the Zhejiang Anping Canal Logistics Service Center.
In accordance with the principle of "lending construction, fee refund loan", the Zhejiang City Anping Canal Logistics Service Center will charge the shipping route pass fee according to the fee standards approved by the Shandong Province Price Bureau.
Among them, the basic passing fee is calculated by 1.75 yuan/tone of weight, and the mile passing fee is calculated by 0.05 yuan/km of weight.
Passport fees are charged from 15 June 2016 to 14 June 2019.
The journalist from the Zhejiang City Port Aviation Bureau learned that there are currently four paid ships within the Zhejiang territory, respectively the Zhejiang River Ships, the White Sea Ships, the North Atlantic Ships, and the Old Wall Street Ships.
The four routes are the shipping routes of the Qingdao Canal, all taking the way of social funding to upgrade the transformation.
The Chongqing River Navigation Upgrade Reform Project is the first to adopt the "Government+ Market" model, to use the project for the construction of the Shandong Province's Inner River Port Navigation Infrastructure, the government represents the main investment, and social funds supplement the financial gap.
White Horse River, Old Vancouver River, North Atlantic Skyscraper and other shipping routes take the way of purely marketed operation.
The funds allocated by the state’s budget cannot meet the needs of engineering construction and restrict the progress of navigation upgrades.
The construction of social funds for public infrastructure is in accordance with the requirements of national policies, and is also a way to break the fund holes.
The performance of Ning Zedong in the 100m free swimming semi-finals has left many Chinese viewers out of speech.
But just in the 50m free swimming premiere, Ning Zedong again updated the people's "downline".
In fact, the 50m free swimming is not the subject of Ning Zedong, his performance and best performance at the Kazan World Championship, also determines that he is not much likely to a breakthrough in this project.
Indeed, Hong Kong authorized media "Grand Publication" revealed that the main reason for Ning Zedong's loss was that he had lost his interest in swimming.
Many factors out of the field may have had a great impact on his ideas about the future, and he may now be more interested in entering the entertainment industry.
After the Kashmir World Championship, Nizhny Novgorod with its super-high color value and good performance, instantly became net red.
So the names “National Husband”, “Little Fresh Meat” and “Flower Beautiful Man” are also constantly a label on him.
Various business activities come to the door, beautiful money path, becoming a glowing road.
In this case, even if Ning Zedong chose to retire at this time to join the entertainment industry, it was not only his freedom, but also a seemingly possible way.
After all, he was only 23 years old, and after a certain study, he was able to play one or two television shows with his popularity.
But I need to see if I have enough qualifications compared to those predecessors.
At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, Liu Liu, 21 years old, has come to the end of his athletic career.
Liu's beautiful appearance makes her quickly remembered, and also puts the foundation for her future entrance to the entertainment industry.
After his retirement, Liu Liu played several television shows and founded his own studio in 2013.
Tanja participated in the two Olympics single-double ten-metre competition, and won 2 gold and 2 silver.
But after losing to teammate Hu Xiao in the 2004 Olympics single ten-meter match, the sporting state of Tanja appeared to decline, and was exploded out by the jumping water team dismissed.
And he and his daughter participated in the “Papa Go Where” series, more than made him make a lot of eye.
The former gymnastic gold generation of Yang Wei, Li Xiao Qing and Chen Ice were highly encouraged to participate in various performance programs.
It is worth noting that Yang Wei Li Xiao Qing then led China to win the 2008 Olympic men's team championship, Yang Wei more than twice won the individual All-Power Gold Medal, known as All-Power King.
While Chen is leading China to win the 2012 Olympic Group Championship, he has also become the Hanging King.
And after the wrong judgment of losing the gold medal at the London Olympics, Chen’s great action, also made him a lot of dust.
But the main energy of these athletes is still on the field, and for the performance show it is just like a bit of water—to touch and go.
But whether retired or active athletes, to be able to get the favourites of the entertainment sector, they need to have the outcome to be guaranteed.
After all, the athlete enters a new field, whether capacity or humans, is an empty state.
Even Tanja, Liu Chen, such as the distractive entertainment centers for many years, the general audience mentioned them, more or more thinking about their performance at the Olympics.
And Yang Wei, Li Xiao Qing and other new people, the introduction at the performance show, without exception, are "Olympic champions".
Compared to some of the above, the name of a Swimming World Championship is slightly weak.
Furthermore, compared to Tanja, Liu, Yangwey and others, Ning Zedong, if at the age of 23, the sports career was a bit frustrated, quickly flows back, the negative impact on his image is probably unestimated.
After all, referring to the athletes, the demands of people are "not seeking a hundred-war victories, but seeking no fear of difficulty", and the distance from this is much worse.
Ten thousand steps back to say, Ning Zedong looks nice, can completely rely on color value to get the support of thousands of brains.
Not a bit of power, only on the outside, want to be mixed in the entertainment sphere, this is not more difficult than well trained to find the appropriate state.
The way of life is chosen all by personal will, but exactly how to choose, Nizhny Novgorod should be counted in the heart.
On the surface, the social networking platform expands the communication circle and reduces the feeling of loneliness.
The power range of social networking is increasingly widespread, not only gradually replacing traditional telephone contacts, but even penetrating into the real underline life circles, quietly changing the social life of today’s people.
The benefits of online social media are obvious, such as convenient and fast, so suitable for the youth.
A survey on university students’ social habits found that 57% of university students spend more than 5 hours a day using their mobile phones, and their daily lives are basically “not out of hand”.
“Social networks have low cost, transmission speed, multiple people simultaneously communicate and other features, which meet the needs of contemporary university students.”
Expanding the circle of relationships, more equal dialogue, and avoiding social concerns are the main reasons why we become more and more affectionate on-line.
The new people just entered the company love to communicate with their colleagues online, "because only entering the unit everyone is not very familiar, through the social platform's commentary, the relationship is much closer than before."
Love dating is also often used to communicate online, "Before with friends because of some mistakes there will be no contact for a while, then in a large group first talk a few words until it is hot to get up."
IT engineer Wu Wu is a deep networking social enthusiast, his majority of social life takes place online, networking contacts are several times more than the number of underline friends.
Wu said he himself also said on the internet more “like fish gets water.”
“You can respond to friends when you want, because there’s a lot of time to think about the word, and the expression can be clearer.”
“Discovered under the ID you came to me to avoid face-to-face interpersonal collisions, not only having room to turn, even giving each other more time and space to think about.
"Different identities people have the same right and efficiency of speech, various social concerns in real life, in the web space all seem to be eliminated.
However, Wu’s friend Xiao Qing believes that Wu’s life is a “very boring home man.”
Chongqing and Wu said they met in a large group, because they were both active speakers, and soon became acquainted.
Chongqing feels that the word of Wu and the web judge if two people, the word is boring, and not initially publish opinions, turning down is a few words "oh, well, yes," or "this I'm going to check on the web."

On the 11th of August, a telephone interview with a journalist has returned to the house of Yuan Yilin, she said: "At that time the situation was too urgent, I have only one thought in my heart is to save people!"
Yuan Yilin is a student of the 2015 grade of the Central Southern Lincoln Grand Landscape Garden College.
Yuan Ilin, who studied urban and rural planning, wanted to visit Sichuan to study local architectural design, so a family went to tour.
On August 8, around 10 a.m., Yuan's father rested at the hotel, and his mother and daughter came out to travel to the Old Town.
Just not far away, suddenly I saw a group of people screaming, and from curiosity they went up and forward.
The eyes looked at "the little boy has been missing, the little girl in the water hardly swallowed, on the river only revealed her small head, sometimes to drown down", when she was a child, Yuan Yilin, who learned to swim, was quickly busy jumping down to save people.
After falling down the water, 165 cm high Yulin found that he could not step down!
It looked like a quiet surface of water, but below it was a strike!
However, she still flows to the little girl.
Yuan Ilin said that the river was thin, fast, less than 5 meters away, almost spending all of her strength.
She made her best to push the little girl to the shore of the river, "The shore is sliding, I'm afraid I don't have the power and also drowned.
So, Yin Yin asks for help to his mother, hears her daughter's calling for help, the waterless Yin lady is preparing for water rescue, and is stopped by the nearby tourists.
On the 10th of August, after the story of Yuan Yin jumping in the river of the rescue was revealed, Yin received a lot of relatives' compassion and praise, while also received a lot of relatives' "responsibility".
“Now remember it is really terrible! to say the truth, when the child on the river shore is fast unable to stand down, when I ask for help, my heart is fast broken.
Mrs. Yin has the heart to say, though it is dangerous, but if she puts the scene again, she will still support her daughter’s choice, and she’s proud of her daughter!
Because it was forced, Yunnan rarely initiated again after learning to swim, "I didn't think this skill was really put into place."
According to Chen, chief of the Yellow Illine Group, Yellow Illine is a “scientist” recognized by Banry, and is happy to help.

The North East Tiger is currently listed as a threatened species (EN) by the World Nature Conservation Union (IUCN) on the Red List of Endangered Species.
According to the Guilin Provincial Forestry Board, the data of 1998 joint surveillance from countries such as China and Russia show that Guilin province has only four to six wild north-eastern tigers and three to five north-eastern leopards.
According to the Chief of the Department of Forestry Protection of the province of Guilin in Long Spring, the province of Guilin has increased the protection of wild animals in recent years, the number of species of North East Tiger and North East Leopard in China is increasing significantly, the distribution area is continuously expanding.
The latest surveillance data from 2015 showed that only in the province of Gilin were monitored 27 wild north-eastern tigers and 42 north-eastern leopards.

Sun Feng is the leader of the party, ideal beliefs are lost, seriously violates the party's discipline, and after the 18th Congress of the Party is still not shrinking, not taking hands, the top wind violates, the nature is bad, the circumstances are serious.
After this incident occurred, after several media reports, it became a focus case, and the social impact was very bad.
After the incident occurred, the head of the Police Division of the Public Security Bureau of the city of Hanoi paid great attention, and immediately organized a large group of skilled police forces to initiate the investigation.
The police immediately executed the suspect on the internet, took various measures to control, and by contacting the foreign police, consulted the king's landscape.

The Greenland shark, also known as the small head sleeping shark, is widely distributed in the North Atlantic waters around Greenland and Iceland, with a height of 4 to 5 meters in adulthood.
But their growth is extremely slow, sometimes only about 1 cm in a year, which suggests that the Greenland sharks may have a long life.
Traditional measurement methods often use animal calcium tissue, and some sharks can be used in the chest, but this calcium tissue is very rare in the Greenland sharks.
A new study led by Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, switched to the Greenland shark’s eye crystals for radioactive carbon measurement.
This method was previously used to measure the age of whales, but it was the first time it was used to determine the age of fish like sharks.
Their analysis showed that the largest shark's life is estimated to be 392 years, with the error 120 years.
That is, the shark is at least 272 years old, and it is likely to reach 512 years old.
Moreover, female Greenland sharks are said to be sexually mature when they are about 4 meters tall, and they are expected to be at least 156 years old.
The researchers, therefore, wrote in the paper that the Greenland shark is the world's known, longest-lived vertebral animal, more than the previous long-lived champion of the vertebral whale (211 years old).
For a year, the exchange results have been significant, the yuan exchange rate has remained basically stable, and has also set the basis for promoting the internationalization of yuan.
From the point of view of the market performance, for a year, the yuan exchange rate is clearly floating, the exchange rate is more flexible and the exchange rate is expected to be generally stable.
Currently, the yuan’s upward and downward flows over the middle price of the dollar over a hundred points have repeatedly occurred, but the process is degraded.
The last exchange measure before the "8/11" exchange was implemented in 2005, with a significant increase in the value of the yuan to the dollar over the decade.
Since the implementation of the new exchange change, the yuan has changed the status of the previous increase in value, with the average price of the yuan exchange rate decreased by about 8% over the year.
On October 1, this year, the International Monetary Fund will formally accept the yuan, becoming the SDR (special withdrawal right) weight currency.
This week, the statistics published by the General Customs Agency of China show that in the first seven months of this year, China's import and export total value was 13.21 trillion yuan, a drop of 3% compared to the same period last year.
In the same month, China’s GDP imports and exports fell just 0.9%, especially exports increased 2.9%.
The relevant experts believe that although imports and exports have signs of stability in July, there should not be too high expectations.
In July, the total import and export value of China was 2.09 trillion yuan, compared to a 0.9% decline.
Of these, exports of 1.22 trillion yuan, growth of 2.9%; imports of 873 trillion yuan, decline of 5.7%; trade surplus of 34.28 trillion yuan, expansion of 34%.
Although the GDP of imports and exports continue to decline, export data have grown, which is the fifth month in a row since March of this year.

According to China’s Voice News Evening Summit, at the end of August, Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will visit Kenya to attend the sixth African Development Conference.
The African Development Conference is headed by Japan, and the previous five meetings will be held in Tokyo or Yokohama, Japan, and will also be the first to move to Africa.
Officials of the Japanese Foreign Ministry said that meetings held locally in Africa would help raise the attention of African and European countries to Japan.
In order to co-operate this visit by Abe, the Japanese Self-Democratic Party will, according to the Commonwealth news, send parliamentary groups to the relevant countries.
The way of Japan’s “advantage” began in the early 1990s, and the African Development Conference launched by Japan also began in 1993, it’s not a coincidence!

Japan's Foreign Minister Tanja Yuan has also recently explained his intentions at the UN Security Council on the African Development Conference.
Abe has announced that it will provide 100 billion yen (approximately 6.1 billion yuan) in five years for the stability of the Sahara Desert African countries.
The observers generally believe that Japan’s generosity to Africa has been mainly aimed at two goals: the first is to increase Japan’s sense of presence in Africa; and the second is to struggle to gain support from African countries on the issue of adoption.
Japanese expert Yang Berjiang analyzed, “Politically, Africa, although relative development is behind, but the number of countries is more comparable, so Japan has always seen it as the so-called ‘Big Ticket Field’.
In the future, Japan will not give up, and the work for Africa will not stop, and will continue to strengthen.
Economically, because Japan's production capacity is relatively strong, the domestic market is relatively limited, especially today in the context of young children's aging, the domestic demand is relatively low.
However, from 10 years ago to the Sunshine Sunshine Sunshine Sunshine Sunshine Sunshine Sunshine Sunshine Sunshine Sunshine Sunshine Sunshine Sunshine Sunshine Sunshine Sunshine Sunshine Sunshine Sunshine Sunshine Sunshine Sunshine Sunshine Sunshine Sunshine Sunshine Sunshine Sunshine Sunshine Sunshine Sunshine Sunshine Sunshine Sunshine Sunshine Sunshine Sunshine Sunshine Sunshine
Japanese expert Yang Berjiang believes that the intention of Japan to get into normal is clear, but the way to get into normal must be difficult.
To its objectives, Japan must first establish good relations with the surrounding countries, where, whether in geopolitical competition or in national disputes and in the issue of historical knowledge, Japan needs a right attitude.

During his 14 years of sports career, Danyang won 18 world championships and became the first person in China's Olympic history to win four Olympic gold medals.
She has been the world’s first athlete for eight consecutive years in the ping-pong ranking and is the longest female athlete in the ping-pong history.
On September 26, 2010, he was appointed Deputy Secretary-General of the People's Daily and General Manager of the People's Search Network Shares Company.

There is also such a group of star coaches on the Chinese gym: they have unlimited landscapes in the athlete age, winning countless glories for the country; after retirement, they have taught the years to the latter, educating to win the championship.
As the first world champion of Chinese men's gymnastics, Yuan Yongbin chose to take a puppy after resignation.
From the female team coach to the male team coach, then to the general coach, Yuan Yuan Bin built a "Olympic Gold Team", the leading team at the Beijing Olympics achieved the mythical achievement of 9 gold 1 silver 4 bronze.
Since then, Tanja has been advertising speaking continuously, more in recent years played important roles like "Burro", "Raywind".
Many NBA players have demonstrated their strength, but someone progresses and someone falls down.
Whether it’s because of the age increase or the time of appearance is limited, there’s a few players’ performances that appear in retreat each season.
Of course, some “regressions” may be just a shrink of data, and the strength of these players may not have decreased.
Even though Wade remains one of the best score defenders in the coalition, his Bull performance shouldn’t have a hot fire as good.
He and Rondo are limited in the back, with the three-point average of Butler's only 32.8%, which makes their next season attacks very crowded.
Coming to Winds City, Lightning Man will definitely give the power more to Butler and Rondo, he is likely to choose the kind of childbirth in the regular game.
The circumstances were more embarrassing, as the first choice for 76 last season, he had to compete with Simons and Ambed in the new season.
The competition may not come quickly, Simons needs to adapt to the NBA square, and Ambed needs to recover from the wound as soon as possible, but it is a question whether O'Connor can have a position in the 76-year-old league.
Last season, O'Connor's 32% score came from low-level attacks, a higher percentage than Cossins, Wuchevich and Brooke Lopez, while his use rate was also high in the league's top 40.
As Simons has shown outstanding control front potential, Ambed also has a body that is more suitable for NBA matches, O'Connor's position is hard to be so strong.
In the last two seasons, Thompson's use has been stable at the top 20 of the league, which is also the two best seasons in his career.
But the problem is that with the arrival of Durant, Thompson’s use rate will decrease, which will affect his play.
This impact will not only have an impact on the number of matches, but Tom God's holding attacks will surely be significantly reduced in the next season, which in some ways will also reduce the adversary's defense difficulties against him.
Durant’s arrival will make the Warriors’ data shrink, but the worst of this shrink is Thompson.
But that doesn't mean that Tom's level is down, it's more like he's made a sacrifice for the whole team.
Parker performed better than the data reflected last season, not only because his basket efficiency came to the highest in his career, he and Aldridge's chemical reactions also made Matteo's benefit.
Duncan resigned, GinoBilly announced another war for a year, the combination of GDP eventually went to the end, as one of the youngest of the three, the French sports car’s fuel tank had little oil.
After winning the third total championship ring, only Jabal, Jordan and Raselby James won more regular MVPs, while Jordan was the only FMVP to win more than James.
Oh, right, James just brought the first professional sports championship in the last 52 years to Cleveland.
James, who arrives in the 14th season of his career, needs a better physical assurance and preparation for the subsequent season.
Therefore, in the regular game, James' data is likely to decline further, and he will share more burden to Owen, but he will still easily be the top three players in the league.
“It is necessary to develop the talents learned from the country in Russia.”
On the 12th local time, the chairman of the Moscow Chinese Federation of Chinese citizens, Yuan Tian, spoke with excitement when he saw the Chinese New Network journalist.

The British team won the silver medal in the seven-person football match, and the Fiji team won the gold medal.
In the seven-person football final on Thursday night, the British team failed to continue the outstanding performance before facing the Fiji team, being defeated by the Fiji team by 43 to 7 at the Rio de Janeiro Stadium.
The Fiji team has won the gold medal for its unbeatable performance in control, cutting, avoiding, co-operating, running and strength, which is the first Olympic medal in the country's history.
The silver medal is a little comfort for the defeated British team, which is the third silver medal that the British delegation received on the same day, enough to make the British football team proud: they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa in the first seven-person football match in the Olympics.
Earlier that day, the British team defeated South Africa by 7 to 5, which could affect their status in the final.
But anyway, the current Fiji team is enough to defeat a spirit-filled 15 team.
Tomorrow, at least one British will wear a gold medal, which may be a comfort for the British team, but it may not be.
It is not easy for the British team to the achievement today.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's instruction, they did not win at the Adelaide International Seven-Man Football Championship.
And now they are just a step away from the championship.
Though they suffered a huge blow, they also made a tremendous progress.
Fiji took advantage, making the British team unable to fight.
For Tom Mitchell and his teammates, it was like a series of buses that were driving.When Oshi Coliniso drove into the county flagship, the World Series Championship team had been far ahead with a score of 5-0.
The match was just four minutes later, and Jerry Touwey scored again on the right side.
12-0, the British team has hardly touched the ball.
Mitchell's strong blockade made the general giant Lyon-na-Carava no third score, but this just delayed the speed of Fiji's score.
At 7 minutes, Asa Waleimaru touched the ground in the right corner.17-0, the British team worsened in the snow.
The Karawa got a point again, and the first half of the game remains a minute.
Then, Watmo Lavovo broke the defense of the British team and reached the point line.
During the middle break, the score was already 29 to 0.
The Fijians seem to be born to play seven-person football, while the English team is still the first to play.
The situation is so.
The British team made a huge change in the second half and hit the Fiji's defense line in the whole four minutes, and in the first half, the performance was good. but after the Fiji team made a great collaboration, it was scored again by Joshua Toesova.
Dan Norton created a score opportunity for the British team, he touched the ground in the left corner and changed the score to 36 to 7, but the match has long been under the control of the South Sea Islands, with their fans singing loudly, dancing flags, and singing and dancing on the stadium.
The great performance of the Fiji team has to be promptly praised.
Matthew William stopped an insignificant attack on Fiji in the last minute.
The end sounded, the Fijians hugged together, and the defeated British team only regretted the departure.
Earlier that day, the Fiji team defeated Japan by 20-5 in the semi-final, while Britain defeated South Africa in an intense semi-final match.
In the first half, Kyle Brown helped the South African team to lead, but Dan Norton scored in the second half with excellent footprint.
After that, Anthony's brother, Marcus Watson, guaranteed the team's victory with a great stop and finally won the British team a silver medal.
Helen Grave and Heather Stanin were inspired by a cancer trainer to win a racing boat gold medal.
Not overwhelmingly, this is the most impressive gold medal.
From the beginning to the present day, Helen Graff and Heather Stanin have received 220 punishment trains, and the gold medal they have won at Estacio da Lagoa has a more extraordinary meaning.
Although they were only two, the voice of one person on the vessel – coach Robin Williams – was accompanied by their shock on the second consecutive female double Olympics gold medal, which was the UK's first pair to reach this high racing boat women's combination.
They haveined a record of 39 unbeatable matches and have an absolute advantage.
What we see is that these two genius athletes are elegantly moving forward on the water, but that’s not the whole of this victory.
There are a lot of volunteer aid behind each gold medal, which is their constant dedication that creates a difference, and the greatest of which helps is not more than a 30-month-old worker who knows he’s cancer, who doesn’t know if he can see the day alive.
As he said, death can come at any time.
I had cystic cancer and they had a surgery for me.
Without surgery, cancer cells will spread throughout the body.
So the situation will be much worse.
This will change your opinion a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
Fortunately, he started treatment in early 2014 and will reduce the impact to the lowest, although in this case it may not be appropriate to say that.
I need a salary, so I have to get better quickly.
This is an inspiration for me.
I stayed in the hospital, and although they said it was enough to go a few steps, I still went 20 feet, 30 feet, and 50 feet around the hospital every time.
This is the starting point of everything.
Battleship in itself is a journey, and this makes the journey a little longer.
At the moment they got the money, they first thought about Williams. This morning, Williams talked a little bit better than usual, it was to overcome his anxiety.
Staning, who was the head of the Royal Artillery Team, will travel to Afghanistan after she said, “I’m in bad mood this week, maybe somewhat extreme, but this gold medal really means extraordinary.
It repeatedly told me how important it was for me and how much effort I, Helen and Robin made.
That’s Helen, Robin and I’ve been working for three years.
Without Robin, we were just an unknown disciple, very grateful to him, he was the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t find a better coach than him.
Helen Grave and Heather Stanin did not win in five years.
The punishment intensity set for the combination is uncomparable with their opponents.
Even in the last 500m, when New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanin and Graff still had a lot of physical energy reserves.
It was surprising at that time.
Helen says, “Stay the rhythm, keep the rhythm.”
It is really important not to be affected by the opponent.
We had a good start while we didn’t expect to do anything amazing.
We didn’t think about the glory of today, we just thought about planning each match and winning this match, and we did it.
This pair takes a year to decide their future.
Grave will be married to television explorer Steve Bachar next month.
But now, she just wants to enjoy the present.
I don’t want to say this is my last match.
This will bring me too much pressure.
In London, it took me about six months to realize that I was the Olympic champion.
This is a new experience and I feel very nervous.
It has passed about 4 minutes.
She said, “I feel better.”

Snapchat’s “animatic” effect is meant to ironic Asian people
Snapchat said the filter was inspired by animation, but some observers believe it has racial colors.
Snapchat’s 1.5 million daily users can change reality through its filter tools and make the image funny and funny.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a role in a Roy Liechtenstein painting.
These mirrors have a curved, curved effect, producing more than 30 million self-shots per day.
Any mistake will be immediately noticed by the public.
Snapchat’s mirrors have been criticized, and the app is alleged to be a black player or be beautiful with white skin.
Thus, when the app this week provided some users with a filter that can create curved eye, strange teeth and pink face effects, some critics called it a racial irony for the "Yellow Man" in Asia.
They even think whether these repeated issues mean that the company has a bigger problem in diversity.
After Snapchat announced it had deleted the feature, Wednesday the Verge and Motherboard reports raised anger.
The company’s explanation is that the filter is a respect for the animated characters, not an ironic Asian.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the filter reminds them of the harmful impressions in reality.
Others also strongly oppose these animated images.
A Korean-American artist who posted these photos on Twitter and was widely shared said in an email that the filters were "at least painful and uncomfortable."
She also said, “It’s hard to distinguish the extreme ironic Asian image from the effects of the filters.”
Although not only the yellow species in the filters, the yellow species is extremely degraded.
Snapchat is not the only company that touches these cultural bottomlines.
From the Board of Directors to Hollywood and the equipment we carry, American culture seems to have been promoting diversity and inclusive.
Snapchat’s large youth groups may be very sensitive because they focus more on racial diversity than the elderly generation.
When a Snapchat filter produced an insulting image of users, the 25-year-old Zhuketti (translated) said in an interview on Thursday: "These things were harder to escape from people's eyes than before."
On Thursday, Mrs. Zhu, a product manager and engineer at Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encourage others to do so.
In an article for Medium and a telephone interview, she said she believed that racial disputes reflect Snapchat’s lack of racial diversity in the recruitment process.
Mrs. Zhu criticized the company’s employees mostly white, the leadership all men and added a tag at the end of the article: #DeleteSnapchat.
As a Chinese-American, Mrs. Zhu said: "Of their employees do not have any different colour races, so they can make such a decision, or their employees have some colour races, but their positions do not allow them to say what they want.
Other observers shared the complaints that she did not respond by Snapchat.
The company did not publish data on the diversity of employees and stated it was a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic background of its employees, but a spokesman said the company recently hired a recruitment staff dedicated to focusing on the low-internal proportion of people and the work on promoting internal inclusion.
Mrs. Zhu said she would close her Snapchat account: “I wonder if they need more users like us to oppose this behavior.”
The parliamentary group said military officials distorted ISIS intelligence.
A parliamentary group said in a report released on Thursday that officials in the US Central Command changed intelligence reports and would describe the war in Iraq and Syria against the Islamic State more optimistic than the actual situation.
The medium-term report comes from a special working group formed by the Republican chairman of the House of Representatives’ Military Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the House of Representatives’ Funding Committee’s Defence Division Committee.The report said the Central Command’s intelligence analysts had a “ wide-ranging dissatisfaction” and the analysts said the top members were changing their assessment of the US-Islamic State war.
The Central Command (Centcom) in Tampa, Florida is the military headquarters responsible for controlling U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
According to a news on the report, “the information reviewed by the senior leaders of the Central Command is more optimistic about the description of the U.S. anti-terrorist action than the actual situation, and always more optimistic than the analysis of other intelligence agencies.”
The Republican representative of California said: “Central Command’s behavior is unacceptable; on the one hand our fighters suffer from war, and on the other hand high-level policy makers receive the wrong analysis.”
The issue of the leadership of the Central Command has been extended to the highest level of the institution.
The report detailed the long-term problems of the Central Command in 2014 and 2015 in describing and analyzing the U.S. training of the Iraqi army.
Although there is no certainty that high-level officials of the Obama administration have ordered to change these reports, according to the report, these analysts feel under pressure from the Central Command leaders, forcing them to express more optimistic opinions about the threat of the Islamic State (ISIS or ISIL).
“In the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and congressional testimonies of the Central Command were much more optimistic than the actual situation.
For example, a official in the Central Command openly said it could be a major military operation to take back Mosul first in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under the control of the Islamic State.
The Republican representative of Kansas, Mike Pompeo, said in a statement: "After months of investigation, the result has been very clear.
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, most senior intelligence officials of the US Central Command manipulated the Command intelligence products, hiding the threat of the Islamic State in Iraq.
The Republican Party established a special working group after analysts learned that intelligence about the Islamic State was manipulated.
As the investigation continues, more findings will be made after the report released on Thursday.
The Prosecutor General of the Ministry of Defense also conducted a long-term investigation of the Central Command.
The Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee published their investigation results on Thursday, in accordance with the Republican Special Working Group’s conclusions.
Representative of the Committee’s Democratic Leader, Sheanda, said in a statement that, between 2014 and 2015, the Central Command developed a too narrow process for the intelligence assessment of the Islamic State and the Iraqi Peace Forces.
Mr. Sheanda said the process “hindered the disclosure of intelligence”, reduced the morality of the analysts and “can’t accept different opinions.”
But Mr. Sheanda and the Democrats also said that they did not find any evidence to prove that the palace attempted to press the analysts of the Central Command, and that their conclusions were in line with "pre-established or political narrative."
The Beast Daily the initial results of the congressional investigation on Tuesday.
In August last year, the New York Times that the Pentagon Prosecutor General began the investigation after receiving a complaint from a part of the Central Commander’s analysts.
The Pentagon spokesman, Maritime Major Patrick Evans, said in a statement that the Ministry of Defense did not comment on the Congress report until the prosecutor's investigation was completed.
But he said, “experts sometimes make disagreements about the interpretation of complex data, while intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defense encourage a healthy dialogue on these important issues of national security.”
The impact of this investigation has exceeded the question of whether the U.S.-led bombing operations in Iraq and Syria have succeeded (the more and more officials of the Ministry of Defense claim).
But last year, these claims raised the public questioning how much President Obama could trust the Central Command’s military operations assessments in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism of Islamic State intelligence reminds the controversy more than a decade ago, when the Central Command intelligence analyst Gregory Huck wrote a study article that pointed out that George Bush’s government, despite the many analysts’ opposition, insisted on sending small-scale troops to Iraq and almost not considering the situation after the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hook played a key role in this opposition against ISIS intelligence.
Last year, officials said Mr. Hook's team came to the conclusion that the airstrikes against the Islamic State refinery did not significantly cut the economic revenues of the terrorist organization as the terrorist organization built a temporary refinery to continue selling oil on the black market, which is largely different from the announced statement.
According to the Times Weekly in September, the Central Command did not publish the findings to the outside.
After several lawyers reviewed the Senate's testimonies about over-optimistic war assessments, Central Command Commander Lloyd Austin III was criticized last year.
General Austin retired in April and is currently replaced by Joseph Watter for his office in the Central Command.
The U.S. has won four wins in a female hockey game, and will win a final match with Britain.
Katie Bam, who was alone in the match 6-1 defeating Japan for three dollars on Thursday, took the first place for the American women's hockey team, helping the American team defeat India by 3-0.
Five goals in the two matches were amazing four, but 27-year-old Barm said she didn’t know she had such an excellent performance.
She said, “I don’t know anything about it.”
I’m not the one who will remember I’ve entered a few balls.
What she knows is that the American team has won four consecutive wins in the Olympics and will compete in the group first with the British team who did not win the Japanese team on Thursday by 2-0 in the group.
Britain and the United States met in the first round of their last match on Saturday.
Both teams are promoted in a quarter-finals, which will decide who will appear as the first in the group.
The team to get Group 1 will avoid meeting a strong Dutch team and thus be able to go further.
In Saturday's match, the American team created a miracle with amazing performance. to know at the Olympics in London four years ago, the American team got the bottom of 12 teams.
Barry was also in the team at that time.
BAM grew up in Brubel, Pennsylvania, taking the hockey bowl for the first time at the age of 3 (her twin sister was engaged in the sport in Drakzel) and joined the national team at the age of 16, becoming the youngest member of the national team ever.
Because she failed to enter the final list, she missed the 2008 Olympics.
In 2012, she and her team members were not taken care of.
The second year, the British Craig Panam served as the main coach, and everything began to change.
“This is a cultural, mental and substantial change.”
We did not reach the current level at the time in London.
We came to a complete turn.
On Thursday night, BAM ran the head in the first half with a record near-range shooting door.
India has not won in this match yet, but the team demonstrated a surprising perseverance and retained the score of 1 to 0 until the end of the third episode, when the boom exploded.
She took the ball along the left side of the square long-range attack, then cut inside to the middle road, shoot into the network, and the American team 2-0.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the last goal in the middle of the fourth episode.
The U.S. opponent Jackie Briggs scored the opponent for the first time in this match, and in the first three victories, the opponent scored one ball each.
This time she was an extraordinary player.
BAM is too.
Panam said, "We are in good condition now," but how good it is depends on the result of the Saturday match.
Cold food during the great depression.
In March 1933, the newly elected president, Franklin Dranovo Roosevelt, was sitting in the presidential office for lunch.
As a cook, President Roosevelt liked the 5th Avenue foods, such as cabbage sauce and maryland water fish.
On that day, his menu was very simple: tomato sauce demon eggs, potato seed and fruit butter as a tasty.
Jean-Zigman said, “It’s for the food to be with those who are suffering.”
Her husband Andrew Co added: “This also reflects the American diet.”
The couple who live in the Brooklyn Highlands are all food historians.
Mr. Co’s previous book, “Picked Frogs”, is about American food, and Mrs. Zigman, in her book, “97 Fruit Garden”, tells the life stories of the rental in the poor areas through food.
The new book they jointly write, "The Big Foods", will be published on Tuesday by Harper Publishing, which presents the history of food in the U.S. during the Great Depression.
After showing some common views on food, they met a journalist in the sandwich store in Eisenberg, which is a simple dining store in the Chongqing area that has been operating since the economic collapse in 1929.
The 54-year-old Zygman put on a cheese with a broken olive sandwich, while the 57-year-old Mr. Koi put on a chicken, potato seed and vegetable plate.
The journalists put a cooked bulk that the couples thought the meals were suitable for discussing the diet during the Great Depression.
Mrs. Zygman said, “The bread was very popular at that time.”
At that time there were flourish bread, liver bread, soya bread.
They are all made of a raw material and a cheap moisture that can be swallowed on the raw material.
Imagine that your dinner is flowerful.
Mr. Co played a strange picture.
He said, “They are like a pen in your stomach.”
Years before the Great Depression, the Americans were self-help, especially in the suburbs.
A group of women burn food for men’s farming workers, with breakfast, lunch, and dinner with newly prepared cakes.
During the First War, it was the Americans who gave food to the hungry Europeans.The Big Foods recorded how the country suddenly became no longer a rich country.
Mr. Co explained why he and his wife were going to write this book: "At that time, food has become the main topic that annoys Americans."
Another unpleasant topic is cold-acid new foods: “Famous foods” such as bread and peanut butter have become the main meal, and peanut butter is “the best way to cook the rest of the meal,” Ziegman says, that’s because chefs can use milk in the sausage to cover the unhealthy foods.
Fresh fruits are replaced by cheap dry fruits.
Meat, which has been the protagonist on the American table for years, has become a rare luxury product.
Strange bulbs only consider calories, rather than the taste, and even the basic cooking consciousness, people first consider nutrition.
During the study of the book, including a variety of recipes, Mrs. Zigman made a boiled butter filled with flower oil.
Mr. Ko said, “This is not common on the dinner table.”
Mrs. Zygman said, “It’s too strange.”
Flower oil and baked cabbage cannot be matched at all.
This is the characteristic of many household foods.
Family economists have influenced the country’s eating habits, such as Louis Stanley, who served as the chef of the Federal Family Economy Bureau from 1923 to 1943, and this has been unlikely in history.
They publish recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, encouraging women to “fine calculations” and dare to make bad foods like cheese and carrots in a tasteful meal.
The rich food is a rich “historical value.”
Particularly pleasant is the government’s response to the hungry people, such as the presidential citizen Herbert Hoover’s attitude “I can’t deal with others.”
Although he openly praised the simple Iowa farm in his childhood, his diet was just like a millionaire.
Mr. Ko said, “He likes to eat European Western foods, such as fish-related peanut sauce.”
He was dressed in a night dress and ate in a golden restaurant.
He clearly disappeared from the people.
If his wife, Elino, didn’t encourage him to make an example on the diet, President Roosevelt might make the same mistake.
As it is said in the book, Mrs. Roosevelt’s servants are not interested in the taste, so the White House’s “food is not only the hardest food to eat in Washington, but also the worst food to cook.”
When the United States returned to normal, many cooking methods during the Great Depression were abandoned.
Mr. Zigman said that what remains is our attention to calories and nutrition as well as the application of science to cooking.
The couple said they learned more about Zygman's mother's eating habits, such as how she didn't throw away food.
Mr. Ko said, “She’s very afraid of wasting food.”
Mrs. Zygman reminded: “She actually made many lives sick.”
For instance, there has been an incident with the “Lemon Bubble”.
After removing the dish, she and Mr. Co took out a dessert they prepared at home: this was the fruit butter that President Roosevelt ate at lunch.
Ziegman said, “This is called milk fruit,” and adds that the new trend for a regular meal is called “common tricks.”
In this dessert there is no fruit oil, only fruit, a bit of powder, sugar, water and garlic.
Everybody is hard to put it deep into a thick brown shade.
Surprisingly, the dessert smells good.
Mr. Ko eaten the second, the third cabbage.
He thought it was an acceptable dessert and told his wife, "Add a bit of broken nuts would be better to eat."
Unfortunately, the latest OPEC monthly reports show that crude oil production continues to rise in July, while Saudi production has reached a new high.
The report does not prevent the markets from suspicion of OPEC’s credibility, and the road to oil price recovery is likely to remain stained.
On Monday, OPEC’s round chairman and Qatar’s energy minister Sada said that OPEC will hold an informal meeting during the International Energy Forum on 26-28 September.
OPEC’s monthly report on Wednesday showed that the entire OPEC production, including Gabon, increased by July to 4,6 million barrels per day, to 33,11 million barrels per day.
OPEC also said in its monthly report that low crude prices have driven global refiners to produce more refined oil, thus increasing the excess of market supply.
The news was influenced, along with the U.S. raised oil production expectations and the surprising increase in oil stocks, with international oil prices falling for two days in a row.
Until Wednesday's closing, the New York Commodity Exchange delivered light oil futures in September dropped 2.48%, and the London Brent oil futures delivered in October dropped 2.07%.
Reuters believes that the proposed oil-producing conference is unlikely to significantly strengthen supply, and the data published by the U.S. Energy Information Agency also undermines market popularity.
Iran's official news agency Fars quoted Iran's oil minister Zhangai's statement on Wednesday that Iran's daily oil production was the highest of 3.85 million barrels, the highest level since 2008.
The news of the meeting just came out, and Russian Energy Minister Novak said there was no need for a new round of negotiations under the current oil price.
The last meeting of oil producers was in April and OPEC countries failed to reach an agreement on any measures.
BMIResearch Petroleum and Gas Analyst Emma Richards said the markets and the media may be overreacting to the OPEC meeting.
Helima Croft, Chief Commodity Strategy Officer of the Royal Bank of Canada, said OPEC changed the mood of the market by releasing signals that they will promote the agreement.
This means like a smoke and a mirror that pulls the eye line (intentionally giving a wrong impression).
Eugen Weinberg, Head of Commercial Research at the German Commercial Bank, said it is low likely that OPEC will try to stabilize the market through the September meeting.
This is likely to further ruin the market’s confidence in OPEC, after all the organization has performed a “wolf came”.
The publication of illegal medical advertisements, complaints and reports should be concentrated, and the medical institutions that have been repeatedly punished should be the focus of investigation.
The National Health and Health Committee and the National Medical Administration of China will organize in time the conduct of the special supervision and inspection work in some provinces.
According to the media, due to the previous mass flow of capital into internet medicine, the current product homogeneization problems are serious, the investment flows slowly decline, and the capital enters the sighting period.
According to data from the Management Research Center of Hong Kong Elephant Hospital, Internet medical companies have died significantly within a year of their start, and about 20% of the Internet medical startups are no longer existing.
However, just as most internet healthcare companies struggle on the financing path of the A or B round, a number of branches leading companies still get capital.
It seems that internet medical entrepreneurship should not be “a bees,” but to look at the market demand, to go down to specialize, to do deep.

During the Cold War, the Soviet Union carried missiles to Cuba, which almost led to a US-Soviet nuclear war.
This incident is considered the peak of the Cold War, historically referred to as the “Cuban missile crisis”.
But it is unknown that, as well as during the Cold War, a strong sunshine was also more dangerous to lead the United States to launch a nuclear war against the Soviet Union, the incident was only first announced by researchers on August 9.
On May 23, 1967, a strong solar storm violated the radar and radio communications of the U.S. military in the Arctic.
These radars are part of the U.S. ballistic missile warning system for Soviet missile surveillance.
The paper, completed by researchers at the University of Colorado, interviewed U.S. military personnel involved in prediction and analysis of solar activity at the time, and looked at non-secret literature.
The paper writes that in the 1960s, in order to prevent the Soviet Union from suddenly launching a nuclear war, the U.S. Air Force always had a part of a nuclear head fighter flying to the sky.
The U.S. military commander did not know the guilty of the interference was the Sun Storm and not the Soviet Union, and therefore ordered the fighter to be prepared for battle.
Fortunately, the U.S. military began its solar activity in the late 1950s and its research on Earth’s electromagnetic interference eventually stopped this potential military conflict.
He later summarized the information provided by the U.S. Air Force Meteorological Office and submitted a detailed report.
The direct consequence of this solar storm is that the U.S. military has since seen space weather as a battle worries and set up a stronger space weather forecast system.

On April 27, 2015, the United States and Japan jointly published a new edition of the US-Japan Defence Cooperation Guidelines in New York, allowing Japan's armed forces to play a more aggressive role in the world.
It was the day that the U.S. Defence Minister Carter, U.S. Secretary of State Kerry, Japan's Foreign Minister Shandong and Japan's Defence Minister Qingdao Yong attended a press conference in New York.
This is the fifth publication of the Japanese Military Assessment Report and the fourth publication of the English version.
The report is divided into nine chapters, including general policy adjustment, military power, defense budget, military deployment, weapons equipment, institutional preparation reform, military training, foreign military security cooperation, military security relations with China.
According to the report, 2015 was the year of the step-by-step reception of the Abe government for several consecutive years to advance major policy adjustments in the field of security.

Repair public sports facilities
The dark coal field warehouse, turned into a “green grass” football field; the crude brick top factory, turned into a modern sports hall.
On the All-People Fitness Day, Hangzhou View Jiang Gate outside the South Fall Camp Sports Culture Park, uncovered the mysterious face.
It was once a coal farm, which has remained empty after closing more than a decade ago, leaving a lot of illegal buildings and living waste.
After the reorganization, it became a sports culture park, and will be officially opened to the outside in November, providing free sporting places to the citizens, and without a doubt opened a new land for all-popular sports.
This reminds us of the Hangzhou Chen Chen School, the "Yungzhou Military School" of the Chinese swimming pool, which has won several world championships.
The swimming pool name is a source that is constantly produced and lively interpretes the relationship between competitive sports and public sports – a rich mass base provides good conditions for the selection of professional players.
The level of competition sport is closely related to the foundation of all-popular sport, competition sport depends in a certain sense on all-popular sport, while all-popular sport depends on the location conditions.
It is that by 2015, China’s per capita stadium area, although 150 times as much as when New China was established, is still far behind the sports power.
In June of this year, the Council of Ministers issued the All-People Fitness Program (2016-2020), which will develop mass sports as a key content.
In order to comply with this shortage, on the one hand, the relevant departments should fully take into account the layout of the stadium when planning the city.
On the other hand, the public sporting facilities that have been built, including the sporting facilities in schools and other units, should try to expand the opening range as possible and to improve the efficiency of use as possible.
Just as the Olympics in Rio are ongoing, it has inspired people’s sporting enthusiasm and has awakened everyone’s participation awareness.
Gilled receives a lawyer fee for her hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
According to the judgment of the U.S. Regional Judges, Gilled Science has the right to obtain the lawyer fees resulting from the patent proceedings with the pharmaceutical company Merck Group.
In June, after a U.S. judge found that Merck had crimes, including false evidence and other immoral acts, Gilled was exempt from paying $200 million compensation due to Gilled's best-selling drug Sophie Bowie and Havoni's two patents of Merck's breach.
In the trial on Thursday, U.S. regional judge Bess Lambson Freeman said Gilled had no need to bear the costs resulting from his defense.
Merck is trying to pursue Gilled to dominate the new generation of hepatitis C drug market.Gilled’s drugs can heal more than 90% of hepatitis patients.
The case first dates back to 2013, when Gilled and Merck accused each other, both of whom claimed to be the effective ingredient of Gilled drug—the owner of the Sophiboue laboratory work.
U.S. supported forces announced that they have taken back Manbij from the hands of the Islamic State.
A spokesman for the forces said on Friday that all the remaining Islamic State soldiers in the city have left, and the US-backed forces have fully controlled the northern city of Mumbai near the Turkish border.
After the rebels escaped in the city, the Syrian Democratic Force (SDF) is now scattering the whole city.
Sharon Darwish, a member of the Syrian Democratic Forces Alliance’s Mumbai Military Committee, told Reuters that they have rescued more than 2,000 civilians kidnapped by radicals.
He told Reuters: “Mumbai is now all under our control, but we’re still going to shut down.”
The Clinton couple earned $10.75 million in 2015, paying 34.2% of the federal tax.
Hillary Clinton released her 2105 year tax declaration on Friday, the declaration showing the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband's 2015 income was $10.75 million and paid 34.2% of the federal tax.
In 2015, Clinton’s charitable donations amounted to $1 million, most of which were donated to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton’s speech fee reached $5.3 million, while former Secretary of State received $3 million from publishers Simon and Schuster with a book about her during her office in the State Council.
Clinton’s campaign partner, Virginia’s Federal Senator Tim Kane and his wife, Anne Holton, have published a 10-year tax declaration.
The two people paid a federal tax of 20.3% in 2015.
Clinton’s campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement that Hillary Clinton and Tim Cain will continue to be a mark for financial transparency.
The clear contrast to the formation of this was that Donald Trump, for false reasons, hidden and recovered the promises of his previous publication of the tax declaration.
Although the law does not require, according to the practice, U.S. presidential candidates should publish their tax declarations.
As a New York businessman, Trump and his lawyers view the U.S. Tax Administration audit as a reason for refusing to publish a tax declaration.
Clinton’s campaign assistant, Ian Sams, tweeted that you are the master, and added a link to the Democratic candidate’s tax declaration.
On Thursday, Trump’s special legal adviser, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he will not allow Trump to publish a tax declaration until the audit is completed.
Those who criticize Trump, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mit Romney and other Republicans, said Trump’s refusal to publish the tax declaration would raise doubts about his net capital value, charitable donations, trade transactions and various other relations, including his relations with Russia.
Clinton’s capture of the issue was strongly criticized by a video on the internet on Friday, highlighting high-ranking Democrats calling on Trump to announce his tax payments.
She asked this question in her economic policy speech in Michigan on Thursday.
She told the public: "For decades, he has refused to publish his tax declaration as other presidential candidates.
According to the Political News Network, Trump did not pay a single penny tax for two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times business column writers quoted several tax lawyers and accountants on Friday, saying that the current situation might still be so.
Federal taxes have become a major issue in the presidential campaign.
Clinton named in the name of a million-value investor, Warren Buffett, a rule that guarantees that people who earn more than $1 million a year pay at least 30% of the tax.
President Obama also supported the proposal.
Last week, Clinton held a meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, where Berkshire Hathaway was located, where Buffett asked Trump to meet and exchange tax declarations.
Buffett said he was also receiving the IRS audit, and Trump was “fearful” not by the tax authorities, but by the voters.
The first tax declaration published by the Clinton campaign group was 2007.
The average federal tax rate paid by Clinton couples currently living in Chabarek, New York, between 2007 and 2014 was approximately 32%, and the total tax rate was approximately 40.5%.
Clinton’s 2015 tax declaration shows that, unlike most Americans, their salary income is only $100.
Their main investment was the low-cost index joint fund, and Clinton’s dividends and interest revenues were $109,000.

Jewish film producers criticize Berlin Hotel to delete Israeli telephone code according to Arab customers’ “requests” — — Reuters News
A Jewish French filmmaker revealed to the media that the Cabinsky Hotel in Berlin did not list Israel’s telephone code, and the hotel staff said it was according to the “requirements” of Arab customers, which caused public shock.
Claude Lanzman, the author of the Jewish Massacre documentary "The Hurt", expressed his disappointment with the Cabinsky Hotel and published an open letter in the German Frankfurt Times.
During his recent stay, Lanzman wanted to find Israel in the hotel’s telephone code list.
But Israel is not one of the countries where guests can call directly from the room.
Is Israel disappeared in Germany’s capital Berlin in 2016?
Lanzman wrote.
Instead, guests can call Israel via the Cabinsky Hotel call center.
To seek an explanation, the filmmaker asked the hotel's front table.
Lanzman said in his letter that the answer he received at the front was "shocking him."
The hotel staff said this was "a intentional decision made by the Cabinsky Hotel Administration."
And the reason for this was more to make the filmmaker angry.
Lanzman quoted the official saying that most of our guests were Arabs and they asked to delete Israel’s code.
According to the South German Daily, Israeli ambassador to Germany, Jacob Hadas Hendelsman, called the incident a “wonderful insult.”
When we heard this incident, we were surprised.
This in itself is a huge shame.
And what happened in Germany and the hotel chain was more ashamed.
This does not require any explanation.
“We hope the hotel can make the right conclusion,” the official said.
The incident caused a hot speech on the internet, and everyone thought it was a scandal.
Some believe that the Cabinsky Hotel was simply "wrapped on the knees" to meet the demand of Arab customers.
Another post directly indicates the hotel as “no face” and indicates that the street, located in the famous Khadam Street, is just near a Jewish church hall.
According to the Mirror Weekly, the hotel soon clarified all the accusations, claiming that everything was “ignorable” and apologizing to Lanzman.
The South German Daily quoted the representative of Kevinsky as saying, “We have never issued a direct order to remove Israel from the fast number list.”
The newspaper also said the Israeli code was added to the list.
Police use tear gas and rubber to evacuate protesters from Brazil
On Thursday, in São Paulo, Brazil, students were confronted with police in the process of protesting the reform of the government’s public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber to expel protesters.
The incident was caused by the law enforcement officials attempting to dismiss students, so the police used rubber and tear gas.
Hundreds of students attended the demonstration and expressed their dissatisfaction with these programs.
In order to save money, St. Paul's Governor Okmin plans to close 100 public schools and 300,000 students will be transferred.
Some of the students who took part in the protests expressed their dissatisfaction with the temporary president, Michelle Temer, through the wall painting.
Just a few days before the recent protests, protesters gathered on the streets to support President Dilma Rosev, who was shot down by the National Senate.
Scotland’s bicycle rider, Carl Skinner, has won a bicycle gold medal.
Scottish cyclist Karm Skinner helped the British team to defend the Olympic gold medal after the 2012 London Olympics at the Rio Bicycle Stadium.
The 23-year-old Glasgow cyclist replaced his Scottish counterpart, Sir Chris Hoy, and became the center of the team.When the young Skinner defeated the popular New Zealand team and returned to its reputation, even the legendary cyclist was proud of him.
Four years ago, the British team sounded surprising, and Hoy won the fifth of the six Olympic gold medals.
The British team was only sixth in the World Bicycle Field Championship in London in March, and Hoi has since resigned.
During the Beijing Olympics to the London Olympics, the problem was that the British team replaced the "first round expert" Jamie Staff.
The team did that just when Cinders appeared.
Hoi's retirement also left a vacuum, and both Chen Imadi and Matt Clampton wanted to fill the vacuum.
After seeing Skinner's potential, the British men's team's coaches insisted to let him join the national team, and Skinner was not hopeful at the end.
Skinner's partner is Cinders and Kenny, who won the gold medals with Hawai four years ago.The three upgraded the Olympic record in the qualification, but this score was overcome by the New Zealand team in the first round.
The three British bicycles eventually defeated the opponent and won the gold medal.
Although Cinders was slightly behind, Kenny was leading the team, and Skinner kept this leading advantage to the end.
The change of strategy is the key to this reversal, and Cinders chose bigger vessels, so the speed was slower, and this allowed Kenny, especially Skinner, to keep fast.
Hawai watched the match as a BBC commentator.Skiner, Kenny, and Cinders saw him when he climbed to the awards.
The 23-year-old Glasgow bicycle driver, Skinner, said: “This is a surprise for me.
I only do my best to make myself famous.
We created the Olympic record in the final and defeated the world championship.
This is too incredible.
There is nothing better than this victory.
After winning the gold medals with Kenny and Hawai at the 2012 London Olympics, Cinders acknowledged he was deliberately falling on the track in a bad start.
He later withdrew the comment, and the opponents of the British team could not appeal.
And this victory has no such problem.
Cinders said: “It’s like London, the britain’s flag is on the station.
We just had a team three months ago.
We’ve lost a lot of world championships, so it’s too surprising to be able to defend the Olympic championship.
This is just a match, just one gold medal for the British team who won seven of the 10 gold medals in the Beijing Olympics and London Olympics.
If this symbolizes the progress we have made in the past five months, then we will continue to succeed in the next five days.
According to the state showed by Kenny, he was not unlikely to repeat Hoi's triumph of three gold medals at an Olympic Games.
If so, Kenny, born on March 23 (this day seems to be the holy day of the British sports community, Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born on that day), will have six gold and one silver medals.
This is equal to Hoi.
Kenny's next race will start today, a three-day race.
The 28-year-old Boltonman said: “I’m going to focus on this game for a while.
The team race is always the best.
You can win the match with your team members.
To be honest, a man wins a little lonely.
Cinders said: "If he could win another two gold medals, he should be awarded a jazz cover."
This was the only match that produced medals that day, but the British team received other good news.
Sir Bradley Vikings, Ed Crancy, Steven Burke and Owen Dour promoted the four-kilometre group race with the fastest results.
Their results were 351.943.
The world record of winners of the 2012 London Olympics gold medals was 351,659.
The first round and final (10:42 pm) will be held today on the second day of the match, and Vikings will undoubtedly be the focus of public attention.
Yesterday he had a dispute with the competition officials before the qualification match, when the competition officials allowed him to measure his height.
In the women's group competition that will end tomorrow, Laura Trollot, Joanna Rosell Chand, Elino Baker and Kate Archbold from Mirgae advanced with a new world record of 413.260.
The British team relied on its strong terrain bicycle team to occupy the initiative in the middle of the Olympics and gained several medals.
After demonstrating its absolute domination at the Beijing and London Olympics, the British bicycle team was a little disappointed during their trip to Rio.
During this period, there have been a number of breakthroughs, including April Tech Director Sean Satton's resignation for allegations of gender discrimination and harassment, and the resignation of legendary characters such as Hoi and Victoria Pendelton.
But the first race night of the Bicycle Hall is enough to prove the legend that the British team will play again at a critical moment to the top.

The head of the Department of Industry Coordination of the National Development Reform Committee today pointed out that the excess of steel production capacity is a global problem.
China’s capacity use rates have been higher than the global average in recent years, and also higher than countries and regions like the U.S. and Europe.
China has taken decisively effective measures to eliminate excess production capacity, and the results are gradually appearing.
The head pointed out that this global issue of the excess of steel production capacity, the Central Council of the Party highlights.
The various departments and regions actively implement the implementation of the State Council’s deployment, seriously carrying out the work, this year to reduce the production capacity of rough steel by about 45 million tons.
From the country’s circumstances, China does not encourage steel exports, instead, it also takes a series of effective measures to control steel exports.
The chairman stressed that international trade in steel products is in essence a market behavior, it is a independent choice that arises from importing countries’ demand, consumers comprehensive consideration of product price ratio and other factors.
The implementation of trade protection measures will not contribute to a fundamental solution to the development of the global steel industry, but will only cause further impact on the international trade order.
When it comes to debt, he emphasizes that settling the debt issue is an important issue that needs to be properly addressed in the process of settling the surplus capacity.
Because of the large size of the assets of the steel enterprise, it involves a wide range, some enterprises' debt relationships are complex, and if dealt with incorrectly, it is likely to cause regional risks.
According to the head, in recent years, with the economic downward pressure increasing, the overall demand of society gradually decreased, the rate of use of production capacity in some industries decreased, and the difficulties in the production of enterprises increased.
Some enterprises do not adapt to the changes in the market environment, production operations are difficult to follow and even at risk of collapse, but are restricted by some institutional mechanical factors, with more obstacles to withdraw in a marketing way, becoming a "zombie enterprise".
The existence of such enterprises distorted the market signals, reduced the efficiency of the use of elements, increased the costs of social management, and prevented the creation of a fairly competitive market environment.
The main causes of losses are the same as the difficulties faced by the global steel industry – the market demand is stagnant and the production capacity use rate is low.
China mainly adopts market mechanisms, economic means and the rule of law methods, the government is mainly doing the work of the workers and social stability, ensuring a fair and fair market order.
The head emphasized that the next step should be firmly continuing to catch the production capacity work, ensuring the completion of the five-year goal of dissolving the gross steel production capacity of 100-1.5 million tons.
On the 10th afternoon, the Chinese tourist police appeared in the Red Square in Moscow, immediately attracted the attention of the people, Chinese tourists with surprises wrapped their hands and greeted, local and foreign tourists were not allowed to attend back.
On the same day, the first professional tourist police team of China – members of the tourist police branch of the Sia City Public Security Bureau, Hainan, arrived in the Red Square in Moscow to exchange studies with the local tourist police.
The Moscow tourist police in the Red Square, the Nikolic Walk Street, and the Gum Shopping Mall were divided into three groups of operational patrols, and the Chinese tourist police studied together with the staff, the whole process lasted more than an hour.
The police officer Liu Hinney is over 20 years old this year, knowing English and Spanish, and she just joined the tourist police team last year.
He watched the words of his Russian colleagues carefully along the way, and occasionally communicated with her.
When they met Spanish tourists coming to consult, the Moscow tourist police made patience to each other in fluent Spanish, which left a deep impression on Wang Ice.
“Moscow tourist police everyone knows foreign languages, some will have more than two doors, which touches us very much.
“Hainan, as an international tourist island, is gradually focusing on attracting international tourists and we want to improve our capacity to match the status of the international tourist island.”
On the same day, before studying with Gong, the Chinese tourist police also went to the Moscow city tourist police station to communicate with their Russian colleagues.
“I often deal with Chinese tourists and I’m very happy to see them come to Russia tour.
The questions they often ask for help are: how to go the road, where a monument is, how to rent, how to return to the hotel.
The captain of the Moscow City Tourism Police Group said that in recent years the city and tourist atmosphere in Moscow have become better and more attractive to foreign tourists.
In order to adapt to the needs of tourism development, a tourist police team was established in July 2014 and was responsible for patrolling the defence, assistance and evacuation of tourists in all major attractions.
Currently, all Moscow tourist police are skilled in English, and some are also skilled in Spanish and German.
Police groups divide them into nine groups according to the level of foreign languages, two classes a week, learning self-defense guidelines, legal regulations and foreign languages.
“There are currently two tourist policemen starting to learn Chinese and they’ve spoken well, and we’re going to continue to improve their level of Chinese,” resakov said.
Rasakov told reporters that the Moscow Tourism Police has gained some experience since its establishment, hoping to be inspired by the Syrian colleagues.
He believes that the cooperation between the police departments of Russia and China will boost the sense of security for their citizens to travel to the other country.
“Moscow tourist police staff recruitment, police patterns, equipment, and good interaction with tourists have brought us a lot of inspiration,” Chen Xiaoku said.
The news agency found that at least nine provinces, including Hanoi, Jilin, Tianjin, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Hainan, Gansu, Fukushima and Beijing, have established the rules for the implementation of the residence permit.
For the conditions for the application of a residence permit, the above-mentioned areas are generally proposed that they need to reside for more than six months, in accordance with one of the conditions for legal and stable employment, legal and stable residence and continuous study.
In terms of treatment provided by the residence permit, the "contingent amount" is different, compared to the provisions of the national edition, the scope of public services and facilities provided in some regions has been expanded.
These areas have increased the facility for children to attend high school exam locally under the relevant conditions.
Moreover, Beijing and other places have also clearly demanded to gradually expand the scope of public services and facilities and to regularly publish them to the public.
For example, Fujin proposed that at least every three years the public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public.
The provisions of the provisions of the provisions of the provisions of the provisions of the provisions of the provisions of the provisions of the provisions of the provisions of the provisions of the provisions of the provisions of the provisions of the provisions of the provisions of the provisions of the provisions of the provisions of the provisions of the provisions of the provisions of the provisions of the provisions of the provisions of the provisions.
For the deadline, the majority of the regions agree with the opinion of the national edition, that is, it will be issued within 15 days.
Hanoi clearly stated that if the application conditions and materials are complete, the residential public security agency shall issue residence certificate within three working days from the date of receipt.
If it meets the conditions for the application of the residence certificate and proves that the material is complete, the public security body shall produce the residence certificate issued within five working days from the date of receipt.

As the first round of 2014's 12th new show, Saric will officially land in the NBA next season and join Philadelphia's 76 team.
Saric is a young European player, and many fans don’t know him well, but through this Olympics, he believes that Saric’s performance has left a deep impression on people.
In the last match Croatia defeated Spain, Saric successfully covered Paul-Gassol in the last minute trying to pull the match into the time-based basket of attack.
In recent days, the 76 squad boss Brett-Brown gave Saric a very high rating, the Matteo boss believed he had seen the shadow of Manu-Ginobilly when he was young in Saric.
Obviously, Saric has shown his talent and made 76 people look forward to him.
Croatia in the first two matches at the Olympic Games, Saric won 24 points, 17 basketballs and 12 assets.
In the first half, Saric demonstrated his ability to pull the space on the field, and after the breakdown with his team members, he was able to throw the ball out of the triangle.
Although the 76-year-old inside line has a lot of talented young players, they don’t have Saric’s outline capabilities.
From the cap to the start of the long-range fast attack and the completion of the support attack, the number of internal players that can do this on the NBA stadium today can be highlighted.
Since the start of the Olympic Games, Saric has won 13 points, eight basketballs and five assists in all three matches.
Since the decision to return to the Knights Team in the summer of 2014, James has signed two consecutive 1+1 contracts.
With the current NBA employment agreement coming to the last year, James will be on the forefront of the job agreement negotiations as Deputy Chairman of the NBA Football Association.
Given the big increase in the coalition’s revenue, which is due to the new TV broadcasting agreement, as well as the struggle between boss and players about how to deal with the money, the outside world is concerned that the NBA will be stuck in the summer of next year.
But for James, he doesn’t have to worry about becoming a free player next summer, as he’s already renewed a three-year contract with the Knights.
No matter when the 2017-18 season officially begins, James is all under the contract.

The future of Portland Mining Factory is full of uncertainty due to the cancellation of power supply contracts
As a power company that supplies the factory reveals that a factory owner will terminate a supply contract and thus fail all the supply contracts, Portland Aluminium Mining Factory in Victoria and hundreds of factory workers are currently facing an uncertain future.
This initiative occurred after the Victoria government decided not to continue granting subsidies to ensure the operation of the factory.
This 20-year fixed subsidy will end in November.
2,000 workers at the Portland Factory may be unemployed.
Once the factory is closed, up to 2,000 people may be directly or indirectly unemployed.
And because the power supply of the factory accounts for about 10% of the total power output of Victoria, it may also produce a chain reaction.
In 2014, Mer Aluminum closed the Hanry Corner mining factory, which led to the closure of the Angels Island power plant last year.
The Portland Mining Factory is currently in loss and risks closure.
The move was made after factory forecasts for the next few years, initially due to the Australian dollar’s strength, and recently due to the price of factory products.
AGL supplies electricity to the large aluminum mining factory through the Old Eyan power plant in the Latrob Valley.The company predicts that three other factory owners will also terminate its agreement.
The factory’s largest shareholder is a joint company of the American Aluminium Company and the Oxide Aluminium Company, while China’s Cisco Group and Japan’s Toulouse Corporation also hold a small amount of shares.
The joint venture said: “AGL is expecting that the Portland factory will continue to operate, which means that the mining factory will continue to produce electricity demand.”
AGL said these contracts were the “contraind contracts” which had to enter into force since November 2016.
The termination period of the contracts is 12 months, so they will be terminated in 2017.
The power company said: "Therefore, AGL still predicts that these contracts will continue to generate income in the financial year 2017."
Any income impact on AGL that may have since the financial year 2018 is currently under the optimistic prospects of the futures market for gross electricity prices.
AGL said the company had reduced the contract value of $1.87 billion in the “finishing activity expectation”.
Me Aluminum said the decision to terminate the contracts "will not affect Me Aluminum's ability to operate the mining plant or guarantee the power supply of the mining plant."
The U.S. company said it signed a 20-year contract with Old Eyan in 2010, which was to enter into force in November this year, but the company did not explain why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts are cautious about whether the Portland Mining Factory in Victoria and the Tomago Factory near Newcastle will be closed due to the poor economic situation in the industry.
In response to the analysts commented earlier this week, AGL operating chief Stephen Mickelson said Portland’s annual power consumption was about 600 megawatts and Tomago’s factory was about 900 megawatts.
If the two plants are closed, the demand for the electricity market will decline significantly.
He said, “As a power company, this is not a good news for us.”
The Community Law Center refuses 160,000 people every year.
Every year, more than 160,000 of the weakest groups are rejected by the community law centers. the funds for the service had already been stumbled, and now they are facing further fund cuts.
In Queensland, three out of five people are rejected in search of free legal advice and agency services, most of which are elderly, immigrants, weak workers, victims of violence, and those who have no resources to fight unfair deportation.
The lack of funding for community legal services has long exceeded the limit, and now there is further reduction in funding.
From June next year, the federal government’s funding for these legal centers will be reduced by another 30%.
James Farrell, head of the Queensland Community Law Center, said that according to the latest report of the National Community Law Center, thousands of people are rejected every year.
Mr. Farrell said the situation would only get worse if the federal government did not change the existing decision.
He said: “The community law center in Queensland has been in a long-term shortage of funds, which means thousands of people will not be able to get the important services they need.”
Those who need to get away from violence, those who have a huge debt that is unpaid, families that are disintegrated, workers who are suppressed, are all faced with legal problems, and the report shows that they are unable to get the help they need.
The federal government will cut its funds by another 30 percent from June 2017, meaning thousands of vulnerable groups in Queensland will be forced to face complex legal issues without help.
We call on Justice Minister and Queensland Parliamentary Secretary George Brands to immediately withdraw the decision to cut the funds so that people can get the help they need in the face of legal issues.
Last year, the state government pledged to raise legal aid funds to the national average.
Now it is necessary to focus on the community legal center and its needs to meet the community, and the White Lockheed government must also invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign team accused of shooting staff
NEW YORK: Trump's campaign team was charged with failing to act after his head in Northern California Asia was shooting a jeep in February, indicating a staff.
Former software trainer Vincent Bodini described the incident on Wednesday at the state court in Charlotte.
Bodini said he had previously hoped that the matter could be solved internally, but after waiting months he realized that "this is impossible."
According to Bodini's description, the head of the name El Philippe "he pulled out a gun, put his right hand's finger on the board, and put the gun on the knees of Vincent's knees.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign teams, Bodini learned from the bulletin that at least four others experienced the same thing.
Bodini said in his complaint: "No shooting does not mean it will not cause harm."
Just two days before the case, the Republican presidential candidate in North Carolina told the crowd that if his opponent Hillary Clinton was elected and chosen her favourite judge, then "those who supported the second amendment," that is, those who supported the gun and the gun lovers might take action, the speech caused anger.
Trump’s campaign team said the media was justified by his discourse and he did not advocate violence.
In his complaint, Bodini asked the campaign team for compensation for his disregard, while also asked Philip for compensation for his attacks, crashes and mental injuries.
Trump’s spokesman, Hop Hex, did not respond immediately to the news.
I can’t contact Philip.
According to a local news agency WCCB in Charlotte, Philip recently left the campaign team.
His consulting company Innovative Consulting Services did not respond immediately to the calls.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign team is controversial.
The two sides in the case are Bodini and Trump's Presidential Campaign Company, 16-CS-14300, the General Court of the High Court of the Mecklenburg County (Charlotte).
Britain must transfer the Olympic spirit and expand the Heathrow Airport.
Heathrow will also bring vitality and prosperity to our community, London and the whole country.
For me, this is the charm of Heathrow, and as at the 2012 London Olympics, we do our best to ensure that our countries and regions can benefit from these events.
The Olympics made Stratford and the Eastern Region great benefits.
And we will regain the area by creating opportunities for local people and near Hitsro.
Only for our local community, we will create 10,000 new student jobs, 40,000 new jobs and get the young people around the airport free from the unemployment.
As before the 2012 London Olympics, some people thought the Hitsro expansion project was too big.
I was told that Britain will not be prepared for the Olympics, and we will be ashamed in front of the world.
The suspects were wrong about the 2012 Olympics, and their suspects about the Hitsro project would also be proven wrong.
While there are always obstacles that need to be overcome, Heathrow is addressing every problem he faces.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the majority and not the minority.
The expansion project will create up to 180,000 new jobs, bring 211 billion pounds of economic growth, and leave a wealth of technology and employment around the airport and throughout the UK.
The team has completed a £11 billion infrastructure investment project in time and budget, including the T5 Terminal, which has been selected as the best airport terminal in the world for five consecutive years, and the T2 Terminal, which is located between the two most busy railways in the world.
Now, they are preparing to build the third runway with a private investment of £16 billion.
Britain successfully hosted the 2012 London Olympics, and I believe the Hitsro Airport expansion project will also be a huge success.
It’s now a good time for us to transmit the Olympic spirit and expand the Heathrow Airport so that we can keep our future escort and create a technology and employment wealth that makes Britain proud.
Lord Paul Ditton is the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Heathrow Airport and former Business Senator of the British Ministry of Finance.
A woman committed suicide on a Swiss highway and was killed.
The victim was lying on the highway at midnight.
The woman who tried to commit suicide was struck by several cars on the highway on Thursday morning and the police are currently searching for witnesses.
The accident occurred on the A1 highway near Moorji, Wozhou, on Thursday morning.
The Wozhou police said a woman was "desperated" on the road in the late night and was stumbled by several cars.
The victim is a 49-year-old Switzerland woman, whose behavior clearly involves suicide intentions.
The woman died at the scene.
Police have revealed that several of the drivers involved have been investigated, but some of the drivers are not yet confirmed, and the police are currently calling them and the witnesses to come to investigation.
Guiles Hofstadt’s lawyer told the Geneva Forum that criminal investigations have already begun, which is a regular process for such incidents.
However, it is not yet known whether a driver will be charged.
Is it possible to avoid collisions?
Hofstadt said: “This will be determined by the prosecutor.”
According to the results of another two similar cases in the last five years, the driver will not be held liable.
According to the newspaper, both cases were caused by someone going on the highway in the midnight and the final judgment was that the driver could not expect a pedestrian to cross the highway in the midnight.
Last year, a police officer was accused of being killed due to negligence, allegedly in August 2014, when she hit a man on the A1 highway near Pyeong and killed him.
The court found that the 22-year-old victim crossed the road after drinking alcohol.
The judge said after the investigation that the woman was driving completely legal and that the man appeared on the road “completely unexpected and unexpected” and that the woman later called an emergency call.
Anyone who can provide information about the incident near Morgi on Thursday should contact the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA's climate model: Venus was suitable for humans
According to NASA’s new climate model forecast, Venus has been suitable for human living.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Space Institute have developed a model that can explore the Venus’ past situation, which uses tools and algorithms very similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model is used to determine whether Venus, which has a high surface temperature, waterless and a atmosphere full of carbon dioxide, has ever had a similar environment to Earth.
Previously, scientists believed that Venus turns slower due to its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulations show that Venus may have had a thinner atmosphere, similar to the Earth, and that the rotation was as slow at that time.
The model can also show the early landscape of Venus.
Venus’ dry areas may be more than Earth, but there has been enough water and geographical changes to raise life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early, the brightness of the sun on Venus was 30 percent darker than Earth.
Scientist Anthony Del Genoa of the Goddard Space Institute explained in a press conference: “In the model simulation of the Goddard Space Institute, the slow turn of Venus makes the day time on its side almost two months.
This warms the surface and produces rainwater that can form a thick cloud layer, and the thick cloud layer blocks most of the sun’s heat to the ground like a parasol.
The simulation results in the fact that the average climate temperature in Venus is actually a few degrees lower than the present Earth.
The model simulated the evolution of Venus is close to what previous planetary scientists guessed.
Although life may have existed on Venus, in the course of billions of years, Venus has been exposed to excessive temperatures and ultraviolet rays.
The oceans on the planet are vomiting, and the water steam is burned by ultraviolet radiation.
With the escape of hydrogen, only the thicker carbon dioxide atmosphere and the fatal greenhouse gas effects left, thus forming the Venus we know today.
The researchers published the simulation results of the new Venus climate model in the Journal of Earth Physical Research Communications.
Patrick Roy resigns from the leadership of the Snowfall.
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as head coach and vice president of the Colorado Snowfall Ice Team, saying he has no right to speak in the decision-making level of the team.
Colorado’s Executive Vice-President, Joe Sachis, confirmed the news and said the club will immediately start looking for a new main coach.
The 50-year-old Roy said in a statement: "In the last three years, I have lively, with passion and determination fulfilled my responsibilities as Colorado Snowfall coach and vice president.
I’ve been seriously thinking about how to improve this team throughout the summer, making it more powerful to the upper floor.
For this purpose, the goal of the coach and vice president must be consistent with the goal of the club.
He must also have the right to speak in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
But these conditions are not yet met.
Sachis hired Roy on May 23, 2013, and he thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
Sachs said: “Patrick told me his decision today.”
We are grateful for his contribution to the club and we hope he’s going well in the future.
Roy was nominated as Jack Adams Award League's Best Trainer in his first season of training in 2013-14.
He helped the club to get 112 points, ranked in the middle area first, but the Colorado team was eliminated by the Minnesota in the first round of the post-season, and in the last two years they lost their arms with the post-season.
In the 2015-16 season, the snowfall team's score was 39 victories 39 and 4 negative, eventually losing the second outcard qualification in the Western Grand League area with a difference of 5 points.
As Celebrity Hall Guard, Roy won four Stanley Cups, each with two seats when he played for the Montreal Canadian and Snowfall.
North Sea oil field workers stop strike and continue negotiations
The chief negotiating representative said the workers in the North Sea oil fields stopped the salary strike and the parties in the dispute began a new round of negotiations.
On the North Sea oil platform operated by the Royal Shell in the Netherlands, there have been several strikes against the oil field service company Wood Group.
According to a joint statement, “Wood Group and Unite and RMT can confirm that we have agreed to restart the current dispute resolution process.”
We will start early next week and hold several full-day meetings in the coming weeks to review these issues.
The trade union said its recent action was to protest a maximum likely 30% reduction in wages, which is the first trade union to take this action in 25 years.
Wood Group reduced the remuneration of North Sea contractors by about 9% this year due to market pressure.
Before this reduction, the company reduced the wages of marine contractors by 10 percent in 2014.
The company said a further reduction in wages would help the company overcome the difficulties of the market depression.
Shell has cut down thousands of employees and announced its plans to shut down oil and gas equipment in 10 countries because the company needs to simplify its operations after mergering with the British Energy Group.
Energy companies are facing pressure from crude oil prices and the UK’s Brexit decision in June.
The Scottish parliamentary member, Dave Anderson, met with the trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss the biggest labour dispute in the North Sea generation.
He said the North Sea is critical for the regional economy.
Dave said in a statement: “In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need a economy that serves the majority and not the minority.”
In 2016, the expenditure for the new project in the North Sea is not expected to exceed $1.4 billion, while the average project expenditure in the last five years is about $7 billion.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of Aung San Suu Kyi stars
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope helped astronomers collect the most complete Aung San Suu Kyi star’s rotation speed.
New data is helping astronomers understand why the star has different rotation speeds and the rotation cycle is linked to the planet’s composition.
Lusa Rebel, a research scientist at the Infrared Processing Analysis Center at the University of Pasadena, California, said in a press conference: “We want to learn more about the relationship between the quality of the stars, age and even the history of the solar system by comparing our results to other stars.
The astronaut is 445 light years away from Earth.
Many of the stars in the group were born about 1.2 billion years ago, and are just in adulthood.
They reached the highest speed of their lifetime.
When it reaches the highest rotation rate, these mature stars throw a lot of star winds.
When these stars winds pass through the magnetic field of the stars, they produce a braking effect on the stars.
With the age of the star, its rotation speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measured the rotation rate of each star by tracking the time when identifiable star black (such as the sun black) appears.
The latest spin speed data set shows that higher-quality stars turn slowly than lower-quality stars.
Rebel compares the stars to the dancers, and the larger dancers turn slowly than the smaller dancers.
Rebel said: “In the Aung San Suu Kyi’s Ballet Show, we found that slow-to-rotating stars are often high quality, while the fastest-to-rotating stars are often the lightest stars.
Because the Aung San Suu Kyi is closer, it can be used as an ideal space laboratory for comparing the quality of the stars with the speed of rotation.
Rebel said: "The Aung San Suu Kyi has set the foundation for the dual-wheeled theoretical model of young and old stars.
We still have a lot of knowledge about how, when and why the stars slow down the speed of their rotation and "take up their own shoes."
Rebel and her colleagues detailed in three new papers their latest analysis of the Aung San Suu Kyi's cycle rate, which will soon be published in the Journal of Astronomy.
South Lake Park Water Management Coco Chen Xiang Army introduced that the South Lake water underground is at the depth of more than 10 meters, unknowing the circumstances of water, it is very likely that there is a danger.
“Al the South Lake rescue team is very professional, it is still hopeful that tourists who are on a large boat can wear a rescue dress, not to do irregular actions on the lake, and to play safely, Mr. Zhang said.
The surrounding village has a unique ocean environment, and has two major recreational tourism resources with natural ecology and human ecology.
“But the individual owners of the small district car seat, fear that this will affect their car seat rental price, also suspect others have private minds, so always behind to break down, resulting in the car seat transformation one thing was stopped.
The question of when and by whom the potato was introduced, is still different in the academic community.
From the current more mainstream point of view, the introduction of potatoes has mainly three lines.
Of the three lines introduced by potatoes, the biggest impact and widespread spread, is that Chen Zhengong was introduced from the Philippines to Fukushima.
The Beijing City Social Group Management Office will immediately conduct a special inspection of the use of the unified receipt of social group membership fees.
Examination is divided into two units of self-examination and focus examination.
The relevant officials of the municipal community office presented that the scope of this inspection includes the social groups in the municipal community in the years 2013 to 2015 to receive the unified receipt of social groups membership fees.
In a 2012 Olympic Communication Strategy, the Rio Olympic Committee said: “The Olympic success is defined by those who share stories on social media.
According to the reports of the Olympic Games, the media has made significant changes in the way they communicate, the form of the product, the language style, the news perspective, and many other aspects.
The International Olympic Committee and media professionals from all over the world appear to have already faced this challenge.
