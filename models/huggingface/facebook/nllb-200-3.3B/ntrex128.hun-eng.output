Members of the National Assembly for Wales fear they'll find themselves in the Muppet Show
Some members of the National Assembly were stunned by the suggestion that their title should be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The trouble came after the Assembly was renamed the Welsh Parliament.
Now, the representatives of all political backgrounds fear that the new title will make them the laughing stock of the House.
One Labour MP said his group was concerned that their new name would rhyme with the words Twp and Pwp.
Not for our Welsh readers: in Welsh, twp is a monosyllable, and pwp is a poop.
A representative of the Plaid party said that the whole faction was unhappy and therefore they were proposing alternatives.
One Conservative MP said his group was open to the name change, but he noted that the MWP was only a leap from the Muppets.
It is worth noting that in Welsh the letter w is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire English u, i.e. MWP is pronounced map.
The position of the National Assembly Committee responsible for drafting the bill introducing the name change is as follows: The final decision regarding the titles to be used to designate members of the National Assembly is, of course, in the hands of the deputies.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 made it possible for the National Assembly for Wales to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation which proposed the inclusion of the Welsh Parliament and which received widespread support.
As regards the title of Member, the Commission prefers the Welsh Parliament Member and its abbreviation WMP, but the public consultation has favoured the alternative of MWP.
The MPs are coming up with new alternatives, but it's difficult to reach an agreement, which is causing trouble for the Speaker of the National Assembly, Elin Jones, who will have to present a bill to change the name in the coming weeks.
The Law on Reforms will also affect the functioning of the National Assembly in other areas, including the disqualification of deputies and the committee structures.
The Members will cast their final vote on the question of their own address during the debate on the draft law.
Macedonia holds referendum on changing the country's name
Citizens will vote on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum is meant to end a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, one of whose provinces is also called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that its northern neighbour has substantial territorial claims and has repeatedly objected to its application for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov himself opposes the name change referendum and will not participate in it.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply a compromise they must make for their EU and NATO membership.
The churches of Harlem are in a state of emergency, and the bells of St. Martin's have been silenced.
"In the old days, as I've heard from the elders, there was a bar and a church on every corner", says Adams.
 Today, none of them exist. 
As you say, the disappearance of the bars would be understandable.
"People have a different way of socializing these days", he says.
 Bars are no longer the communal halls where people hang out every day.
As for the churches, Adams fears that the church's divestment will not fulfill the leaders' hopes and that in time they will return to the same place they started.
In the place of the churches, residential buildings will be built, whose housing also does not help the fate of the churches still remaining.
The overwhelming majority of those who buy housing in these buildings will be white he claims , which further precipitates the final closure of the churches, as it is unlikely that the majority of those who move into these housing units will join the faith community.
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black town - the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out of my church in the '30s,
which was then taken over by a nearby black congregation.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who is known for leading a boycott of the Harlem shopping street, 125th Street, against business owners who refuse to employ blacks or sell black products.
In 1939, a fire caused severe damage to the building, but during the renovation, the bell tower was built at the request of the community led by Reverend Johnson.
Reverend David Johnson, Johnson's son and heir at St. Martin's Parish, proudly called the game "the poor man's bell".
And according to the expert who played the trumpet in July, this trumpet is a cultural heritage, an irreplaceable instrument of historical significance.
University of Michigan scholar Tiffany Ng also noted that this was the first bell in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had joined the larger bell in the Riverside church 18 years earlier.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin didn't sign anyone to replace him.
In St. Martin, in recent months, a complicated situation has developed involving architects and contractors, who are partly involved in the lay administration of the church, partly in the bishop's office.
The parish's governing body, the parish council, wrote to the bishop's office in July, objecting to the office's allocation of costs to the council, which had not been involved in the selection of architects and contractors contracted by the office.
Some members of the church community are complaining about the lack of transparency around the office building.
A 13-year-old California boy was attacked by a shark while fishing for shrimp
Official reports say a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while fishing for shrimp on the opening day of shrimp season Saturday in California.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 a.m. on Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel, on KSWB-TV in San Diego, said that Saturday morning he was diving with his friends for about a half hour when he noticed a boy screaming for help, and he drove with his cane to help him out of the water.
Hammel at first thought the boy was just teasing him because he had caught a crab, but then he realized the boy was screaming "He bit me!"
He bit me!
The shoulder was torn from the collarbone, and he told Hammel what he saw when he got to the boy.
I started yelling for everyone to get out of the water.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is currently being treated in critical condition.
The shark that attacked the boy is not known to exist.
As rescue captain Larry Giles told the press, sharks had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but were determined to be non-human.
Captain Giles also told me that the boy suffered traumatic injuries to his upper body.
The authorities have closed the coastal area between Ponto Beach (Casablad) and Swami (Ecinitas) for 48 hours for the time of the investigation and for security reasons.
Giles says that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's is looking to expand into the British beauty market.
Sainsbury's would have expert salesmen and department-store-style piper stands to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams.
As part of its drive to tap into the £2.8 billion UK beauty market, which is growing amid a downturn in fashion and household goods sales, the chain is testing larger piper stands in 11 stores across the country, and if successful, they will be introduced in more stores from next year.
The increase in pipelines is due to the fact that stores are trying in different ways to fill the shelves previously occupied by televisions, microwave ovens and household appliances.
Sainsbury's has said it will double its offerings to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which it is offering for the first time.
But the previous brands, L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, will also be located in a larger area on branded stands like those that Boots and similar stores have for customers.
The chain is also relaunching the Boutique makeup line, which is now mostly vegan and is increasingly sought after by younger customers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop is testing its presence in two Sainsbury's stores, one of which opened last week in Croydon, south London, while the other will open this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
With the rise of online shopping and the shift of food buying to smaller local shops, department stores must make greater efforts to lure customers.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe says the offerings will become more like a mixed-use store as the chain tries to compete with discount stores like Aldi and Lidl by introducing more services and products other than food.
Since the acquisition of the two chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened Argos and some Habitat departments in hundreds of stores. This has also had a positive impact on food sales, making the acquisition even more profitable.
The chain's previous attempt to wrinkle the beauty and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's entered into a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but a dispute over the distribution of revenues from its drugstore divisions ended it.
The new strategy was born after Sainsbury's sold its 281 stores in the pharmaceutical business to Celesia, the operator of Lloyd's pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
The department store chain says Lloyds will be part of the strategy and will offer a wider range of luxury leather goods in four stores, with brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
As Sainsbury's commercial director, Paul Mills-Hicks, put it: 'By redesigning the look of our piper showcases, we want to create a more pleasant environment for our customers.
We also have trained staff to help with counseling.
Our range of brands caters to every need, and the attractive environment and convenient location provide a compelling attraction that elevates the shopping experience to a new level.
Peter Jones has been sacked after Holly Willoughby backed out of a £11 million deal.
Dragons' Den star Peter Jones has left after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11m deal for her lifestyle business to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly, the brand of home furnishings and accessories.
The two celebrities' venture has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's previously-mentioned Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host announced on Instagram that she's quitting.
Holly Willoughby has pulled the plug on Dragons Den star Peter Jones by jumping out of their promising lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her own highly lucrative contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to some sources, Jones was stunned when the television mogul announced in a tense meeting at the headquarters of Jones's business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday that his new contracts worth a total of £1.5 million left him with not enough time to devote to their common brand of homewear and accessories, Truly.
The two celebrities' venture had previously been likened to the Goop brand listed by Gwyneth Paltrow, and was expected to double Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune.
As 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones left the island for one of his vacation homes.
According to a source, "Truly was the most important thing to Holly.
He was going to do this for the long term, and it's going to be his livelihood for the next few decades.
His resignation came as a complete surprise to everyone.
What happened on Tuesday was a surprise to everyone, as it was so close to the start.
The warehouse at the Marlow office is full of merchandise waiting to be sold.
Experts say the departure of the host of This Morning, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the business millions, thanks to the vast sums invested in everything from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear, and the potential slippage of the business.
And it could also mean the end of an old friendship.
The show's host and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for the past 10 years.
He and Willoughby Capp launched Truly back in 2016, and Jones, 52, took over as chairman in March.
The two couples often vacation together, and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production office.
Willoughby will be the new face of M&S, taking over from Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones commented on the events last night, saying, "We don't want to comment on his business dealings".
♪ We've said some tough words ♪ ♪ And then we fell in love ♪
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the press for his statement, which some might consider unprofessional, and for speaking so positively about the North Korean leader.
Why did Trump give up so much?
"What's the matter?" asked Trump in a funny newsreader's voice.
I didn't give up a single thing.
As he noted, Kim would be happy to meet for a second time, after the first meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a huge step towards North Korea's denuclearization.
However, negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's representative, Ri Jongho, told the UN General Assembly on Saturday that his country saw no appropriate response from the United States to North Korea's early disarmament moves.
Instead,  said,  the United States will continue to maintain sanctions targeted at lobbying.
Trump was more optimistic than that in a campaign speech.
"Things are going great with North Korea", he said.
We were supposed to go to war with them.
Millions of people would have been killed.
But now we have a very good relationship.
As you said, your efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results with the completion of missile tests, the release of the hostages and the return of American troops.
He also explained why he spoke in such an unusual way about his relationship with Kim.
"It's not hard to be a president, but right now there's not a crowd of 10,000 people outside trying to get in, there's only about 200 people in front of me", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Hundreds of dead in Indonesia from tsunami and earthquake that rocks the island
Indonesia also refused the help of international aid agencies after the Lombok earthquake.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population had to be evacuated, no national disaster had been declared, which would be a prerequisite for international aid to arrive.
In the past, they have been very clear in many cases that they do not need international help, so we are in a somewhat difficult situation,  said Sumbung.
Save the Children is already working on setting up a rescue team to be sent to Palu, but it is not yet certain that foreigners will actually be able to participate in the rescue on the ground.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said that the Indonesian agencies are currently evaluating the situation in Palau to see if it is necessary to involve international aid agencies.
Despite the fact that Indonesia is regularly hit by earthquakes, the country is extremely unprepared to face the destructive power of nature.
Although tsunami buffers have been built in Aceh, they are not common in other coastal areas.
Although a tsunami warning was in effect, the apparent lack of a tsunami warning system in Palub also contributed to the disaster that claimed lives.
Even in the best of times, travel between Indonesian islands can be difficult.
In times of natural disasters, logistics are even more challenging.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok is on its way to Palu, but it will be at least three days before it reaches the disaster-stricken area.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia's dilapidated infrastructure a central focus of his election campaign, and has spared no expense in road and rail projects.
However, the Joko government is now facing budget deficits ahead of next year's elections.
The president also faces sectarian tensions that have persisted in Indonesia, as members of the Muslim majority have embraced a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced by riots in which Christian and Muslim gangs fought one another in the streets with clubs, bows, arrows, and other sharp weapons.
Video: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scoring the equaliser in a big goal against Chelsea
In the Premier League match at Stamford Bridge in London, Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat by Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute.
His team was down 0-1 when Sturridge was given a free kick from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal.
First, he put the ball to the left, then he kicked a big kick into the far corner of the gate.
The shot was fired high above the sixteenth and the net moved to the top right corner.
The ball finally entered the net over the goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga.
"I just wanted to get in position because there's always someone like Shaq to put the ball in front of me, so I tried to get myself in as good a position as possible", Sturridge said in response to a question from LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming and I just took off my shirt, then I didn't think twice and I shot him.
Chelsea led 1-0 at half-time after a goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blue's corner pass to Mateo Kovacic, then he managed to break away in midfield and rush into Liverpool's corner.
Kovacic, after a quick pass, moved and recovered the ball in midfield.
Then he made a beautiful pass to Hazard to the sixteenth.
Hazard ran down the defence and finally, with a left-footed shot, sent the ball into the far corner of the Liverpool gate next to Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will next face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3pm on Wednesday afternoon at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday afternoon at 3pm in London.
There are 832 victims of the tsunami in Indonesia
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the local disaster agency said on Sunday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake and 20-foot-high tsunami that struck Friday buried several people in the rubble, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The streets of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, are covered with the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder in connection with the stabbing of a woman.
Police have launched a murder investigation after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The body of a 44-year-old woman was found stabbed in Grayson Mews on John Street at 7:55 a.m., and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking residents in the area to report any sightings or deaths.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still in its early stages, however, we would ask anyone who has been in the John Street area of Birkenhead and may have seen or heard anything to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, to contact us if they have any onboard camera footage, as they may have information relevant to the investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the murdered woman was a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
During the afternoon, friends of the woman arrived at the scene to find out where the body was found in the early hours of the morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and police are currently notifying the victim's relatives.
A cab driver from Grayson Mews tried to enter his apartment, but was informed by the police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building at this time.
When he found out what had happened, he couldn't speak.
Residents of the building have now been informed that it may be several hours before they can re-enter the building.
One of the officers told someone that the entire building is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A woman struggled with her tears.
"This terrible" he repeated.
At 2 p.m., two police vans were inside the cordon and another outside.
Inside the cordon, several police officers were watching the block.
Anyone with any information can write a message to @MerPolCC, call the 101 number, or contact the Crimestoppers organization on the anonymous 0800 555 111 number, and refer to the 30 September 247 file.
The Cromwell statue in Parliament is the latest victim of the history-rewrite fever.
The statue's banishment may have been poetic justice for the destruction of England's cultural and ecclesiastical heritage by Cromwell and his fanatical Puritan followers in their time.
But the Cromwell Society says Crick's proposal is folly, an attempt to rewrite history.
According to John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, "It was inevitable that the current debate about the removal of statues would eventually target the statue of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster.
During the English Civil War, the destruction of the image was not ordered and carried out by Cromwell.
So perhaps another Cromwell may fall victim to the actions of his predecessor, Thomas, in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's impressive Cromwell portrayal reflects the views of the 19th century and sets the tone for a historical figure who many still believe should be celebrated today.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is perhaps less than he was at the end of the 19th century, but he is still seen by many as the guardian of parliament against external pressure, which in his case was, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this image is accurate remains a matter of historical debate.
What is certain is that this conflict, which began in the mid-17th century, would have a great impact on the future of our nation, and Cromwell is a person who can be identified as representing one side of this conflict.
And his achievements as Lord Protector are worth celebrating and remembering.
A Chinese farmer was mortally wounded by a murderous pig
Local media reports that a pig attacked and fatally wounded a farmer in a market in southwest China.
A man identified only as Yuan was found with a torn ligament, covered in blood, near a pig at a market in Liupanshui, Kujcsou Province, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs in a pig farm in Xining city, Qinghai province, China, 30 May 2005.
The man had traveled with his cousin from the nearby province of Jünnan to sell 15 pigs at the fair.
The next morning, his cousin found the man's body and discovered the door to the neighbor's pigsty was open.
He said the mouth of the giant boar in the pigsty was bloody.
According to the report, the expert investigation found that the 300-pound pig did indeed kill its owner.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and bruised", said a relative referred to only by his last name, Wu, to the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the pigsty at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent further harm while police were at the scene to investigate the traces.
Yuan's family and the market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for the man's death.
Although not common, there have been reports of pig attacks on humans.
In 2016, a couple on their farm in Massachusetts were attacked by a pig, causing life-threatening injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig in Wales cornered a farmer on his tractor until the farmer's wife could not alert him.
After an Oregon farmer was bitten by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that while pigs are not normally aggressive, they can become aggressive from the taste of blood.
They're very playful.
Like little children, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them the respect they deserve.
Heavy rainfall in the wake of Hurricane Rosa in the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it makes landfall over the colder waters of northern Mexico.
However, Rosa will continue to bring heavy rains to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
With wind gusts of up to 90 miles per hour, Rosa made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane Sunday morning at 5 a.m. eastern time, 400 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The hurricane is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure area is forming over the Pacific Ocean and heading west toward the west coast of the United States.
The storm is expected to bring up to 10 inches of rainfall to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the approaching low-pressure clouds will cause heavy rain to fall in the southwest over the next few days.
Here, the 10 inches of rainfall can cause flash flooding, debris flooding, landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical storms can bring up to 2 inches (5/8 cm) of precipitation per hour in some places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, rainfall is expected to be 5 to 10 inches in some areas, especially in Arizona.
Sudden flooding may also occur, with rapidly decreasing intensity due to the sporadic nature of tropical rains.
During the rainy season, it is especially advisable not to walk in the desert.
Heavy rainfall can turn canyons into raging rivers, and storms can be accompanied by sudden winds and dust clouds.
The approaching low-pressure masses are expected to cause heavy rainfall in some areas along the coast of Southern California.
Up to one and a half centimeters of precipitation is possible, which can cause minor floods filled with debris and cause smooth roads.
This will be the first rain of the wet season in the region.
Small tropical showers are expected in Arizona Sunday night and Monday morning, with rain expected to spread across the state Monday afternoon and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread across the Four Corners region on Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature fluctuations will be experienced in the United States as the polar air masses cool, but the tropics remain reasonably warm.
This can cause drastic temperature variations over short distances.
A prime example of this is the situation in the central part of the United States on Sunday.
Temperature differences of nearly 10 degrees are found between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis, Missouri, and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the summer heat is expected to return to more areas.
The central and eastern United States are expected to experience warm weather in the first half of October, with temperatures of about 8 to 12 degrees Fahrenheit [25 to 30 degrees Celsius] from the southern Great Plains to parts of the Northwest.
The temperature in New York will reach 25 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about five degrees above average.
The long-range weather forecast predicts that temperatures in the eastern United States will likely exceed the average by the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's audition
Over 20 million viewers across six television networks tuned in to the testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and his accuser of rape in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political impasse has not been resolved, and the network has had to cut the program at the last minute because of a Friday screamer: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake has managed to get the FBI a week to investigate the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that a high school bully at the time had grabbed Kavanaugh and tried to strip him down.
In his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was 100 percent sure that didn't happen.
The testimonials were probably viewed by more than the 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday.
Nielsen calculated the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, the Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of other channels that broadcast the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
And it's also hard for Nielsen to measure the number of people who watch the shows at work.
For comparison, that's the number of viewers a football playoff or an Oscar presentation gets.
Of all the channels that have aired pundits supporting Kavanaugh's appointment, according to Nielsen, Fox News Channel had the highest average viewership, with 5.69 million viewers watching the entire day of the hearing.
In second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS was watched by 3.1, NBC by 2.94, MSNBC by 2.89, and CNN by 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest has not diminished since the hearing.
The star of Friday's drama was Senator Flake.
After the moderate Republican senator's office issued a statement saying he was voting for Senator Kavanaugh, he was seen on CNN and CBS Friday morning, greeted by a thunderous crowd of protesters as he was taken to the Judiciary Committee by elevator.
He stood there for a few minutes, blindfolded, while the crowd rebuked him and CNN broadcast the scene live.
"I'm standing here before you", said a woman to the senator.
Do you really think that Kavanaugh is telling the truth in front of the country?
Others shouted at her, "You have the power to do what so many women have not.
All Flake said was that his office had issued a statement, and before the elevator doors closed, he said he would share his statement at the committee hearing.
It was shown live on cable and broadcast channels hours later as the committee voted to put Kavanaugh's nomination on the ballot for a full Senate vote.
Flake, however, said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the charges against the nominee next week, as was urged by the minority Democrats.
Flake was convinced of the need for this after a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after talking to the Coons and later to other senators.
He made a fitting use of his power in Flake's decision, since it was obvious that without the investigation, the Republicans would not have the votes necessary to approve Kavanaugh's nomination.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh allegations.
Theresa May, the British Prime Minister, accuses the Brexit opponents of political games
In an interview with the Sunday Times on Sunday, Prime Minister Theresa May accused opponents of her plans to leave the European Union of playing politics with the future of the United Kingdom and undermining the nation's interests.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, arrives at the Birmingham Conference of the Conservative Party on 29 September 2018.
In another front-page interview directly following May's interview, May's former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, attacks May's so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal to deal with Britain and the EU's customs duties is "totally absurd".
Wayde Sims murder: police have arrested Dyteon Simpson, suspected of murdering LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of 20-year-old Louisiana State University basketball player Wayde Sims.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested on suspicion of murder in the first degree, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Police released a video of Sims and Simpson fighting, and also reported that Sims' glasses had fallen off during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene, and Simpson's DNA was played on WAFB, the CBS network's channel.
After questioning Simpson, police announced that the young man had confessed to shooting Sims.
According to the Advocate's report, the court set bail at $350,000.
Preliminary reports from the East Baton Rouge County coroner's office released Friday indicate the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department has thanked the Louisiana State Police's fugitive offender task force, the state police's crime lab, the university police, and the residents of the area for their assistance in the investigation leading to the arrest of the suspect.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement for their dedicated and persistent efforts to uncover the truth.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-7 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also an LSU basketball player.
Sims averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the news of Sims' death had shocked and devastated the team.
"You're always afraid that something like this is going to happen", Wade said.
Volcano Floods Mexico City with Ash
Ash from the Popocatépetl volcano reached the southern outskirts of Mexico's capital.
After the crater became a hotbed of volcanic activity, with a total of 183 gas and ash explosions in 24 hours, the National Center for Disaster Management urged the Mexican population to stay away from the volcano.
The center has also observed several tremors and tremors.
Images on social media show cars in districts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco, with windshields covered in a thin layer of ash.
Geophysicists detected increased activity at the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the Mexican capital, after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck the central region of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police and thousands joined rival demonstrations on the first anniversary of Catalonia's secessionist referendum.
A group of masked separatists threw eggs and paint powder at the riot police who were holding them back, so that the streets that were once crowded with tourists were now covered in thick dust paint.
Later that day, further fighting broke out, with police using batons to maintain order.
For hours, pro-independence groups chanting "We will not forget, we will not forgive" and pro-union protesters lining up behind the slogan "Long Live Spain" faced each other.
According to local media, 14 people were injured in the protests.
Tensions continue to rise in the region, which is rife with independence aspirations, following the referendum on 1 October, which was declared illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for secession, although turnout was quite low, as most Unionists boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly a thousand people were injured last year when police used violent clashes to try to stop voting at polling stations.
Pro-independence groups have been on the streets all night Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
Although the demonstration was not stopped, it did not go on the normal route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in the separatist protests with his wife, says there is no chance for Catalonia to gain independence.
Last year was one of the best years of our lives.
I've seen my parents throwing candles for the vote, but now we're done with it.
Despite winning a significant, albeit narrow victory in regional elections last December, the pro-independence parties in Catalonia are struggling to maintain momentum this year, with many of their most prominent leaders in voluntary exile or in detention awaiting a court verdict for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
The 42-year-old auto mechanic Joan Puig, who recorded the pro-police protest on her cell phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is becoming more tense", he says.
The negotiations were triggered by the announcement on Saturday by Oriol Junqueras, a Catalan leader who has been in pre-trial detention since last year, that he would run in the European Parliament elections next year.
I can only reject the devaluation of democratic values and the repression that the Spanish government represents if I am a candidate in the European elections.
Police arrested three men driving their car into a house in Londonderry
Police have arrested a 33-year-old, a 34-year-old and a 39-year-old man who have been driving into a house in Londonderry on multiple occasions.
The incident occurred at approximately 7:30 p.m. British Summer Time at Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Bob Blemmings says the gate and the building itself have been damaged.
There may have been a moment when the car was shot at point-blank range.
With a goal from Menga, Livingston beat Rangers by 10 points.
Dolly Menga scored the first goal to ensure Livingston's victory
Livingston, fresh off his first-year debut, surprised the Rangers by handing the second of his three losses to Steven Gerrard, who has been coaching the Ibroxi club for 18 games.
Dolly Menga's goal made the real difference as Gary Holt's team was drawn into a playoff with Hibernian's team in second place.
So Gerrards remain without a win away from home in the current Scottish league season, and next Sunday they face the number one team, Hearts, who are eight points behind them.
Before that, the Rangers have a game to play in the Europa League against Rapid Wien on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has increased their division-leading win total to six, which means that Kenny Miller's replacement Holt last month is not even on the team.
Livingston missed a number of positions against a host of off-the-field players.
Holt's team could have taken the lead well before the game's only goal, as their offense was causing Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson broke through the opposition defense, but he was too long on the attack, and then Alan Lithgow's attempt proved wide after he slipped to reach Craig Halkett's cross-leaf ball in front of the goal line.
The home team let the Rangers play their own game, because they were sure they could disturb the guests in the fixed game situations.
The deciding goal came from exactly such a situation.
The Rangers had a free kick, and Livingston found a gap in the defence, creating a situation for Declan Gallagher and Robinson to use to strike from the middle of the sixteenth.
At this stage of the game, the Rangers were leading the ball, but the home defense remained impenetrable, with Liam Kelly's goal barely in jeopardy.
This trend continued into the second half of the match, except for one situation when Kelly had to defend against Alfredo Morelos.
Scott Pittman's attempt was footed by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow missed the goal on another free kick from Livingston.
The offense was also hit with two penalties, one for Halkett's substitute entrance against Glenn Middleton, and one for a tackle.
♪ A phenomenal game by Livingston ♪ ♪ Match analysis
From the Tony Macaroni Arena, this is Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland correspondent
Livingston performed phenomenally and won the awards.
Each player has performed exceptionally well and exceeded all expectations.
The team's personnel and style of play have changed little since they returned to the front, but Holt's efforts deserve serious recognition, as the coach has been a huge booster since his arrival.
Several players have been at their best.
Halkett, the team captain, was a giant with a well-organized defense, and Menga was a real pain to Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
The Rangers played with no vision.
As good as they were at times under Gerrard, they were unable to reach that level.
The last shot was always missing from the formula. They only managed to break the home defence once anyway. So Rangers have to get back together quickly as they slipped back into the middle of the field.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
The meeting between the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin on Saturday morning (29 September) was characterised by a pleasant atmosphere and good cheer.
It was the last day of Erdoğan's visit to a divided Germany, which was aimed at improving ties between NATO member states.
Relations between the two countries have deteriorated over issues related to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's EU membership.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne for the opening ceremony of a newly built, huge mosque.
The city of Cologne is home to the largest community of Turks living outside of Turkey.
Police have banned a gathering of 25,000 people outside the mosque citing security reasons, but many supporters of the president showed up to see the Turkish head of state.
In addition, hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, including many Kurds, expressed their displeasure with Erdoğan's policies and the German government's decision to host the head of state.
The two opposing protests are a good example of the divisive nature of the president's policies, who is celebrated as a hero by some German citizens of Turkish origin, while others see him as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: hit by a cycling car and killed
A cyclist was killed when he collided with a car in London.
The crash occurred at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy thoroughfare in Deptford in the southeast part of the city, at approximately 10:15 a.m. local time.
The driver of the passenger car stopped, and the paramedics tried to help the cyclist, but he died at the scene.
The collision came just months after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, just a mile from the scene of Saturday's accident.
A statement from the London Police said officers were still working to establish the man's identity so they could notify relatives.
Roadblocks and bus intersections are hampering traffic as a result of the investigation, and authorities are advising motorists to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six prison guards were injured in a riot
Six prison guards were injured in a riot at a maximum security men's prison, the prison administration announced.
The riot began at 9.30am on Sunday at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire and has so far not been contained.
The authorities have ordered a special unit called "Tornado" to the scene to deal with the situation.
The members of the Special Forces suffered minor head injuries, which were treated at the scene.
A spokesman for the Department of Corrections said: "A specially trained prison guard is handling the situation at Long Lartin Correctional Facility.
Six members of the team had to be treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons at any level, and those responsible will be turned over to the police and face further prison sentences.
The Long Lartin Men's Correctional Facility houses over 500 convicts, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, reports said the prison director was hospitalized after being attacked by an inmate.
Last October, the Special Forces were also needed to quell a serious disturbance in which prisoners attacked prison staff with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens to bring flash flooding to Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (although drought-stricken areas may improve)
Arizona is rarely hit by tropical depressions, but it is expected that this is exactly what the state will have to deal with early next week, when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa sweep across the desert southwest, drastically increasing the risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a flood warning for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, and for southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is forecast to pass directly through the city of Phoenix on Tuesday, where it is expected to arrive Monday night, bringing heavy rain.
The Phoenix Meteorological Service posted the following message on Twitter:  Since 1950, ten tropical cyclones have reached tropical storm or depression form within 200 miles of Phoenix!
For example, Hurricane Katrina in 1967 came within 40 miles of the border of AZ.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 50 to 100 millimeters of rainfall, which in extreme cases, such as the Mogollon Rim in Arizona, could reach 150 millimeters.
Other parts of the southwestern desert regions (the central Rocky Mountains, Great Basin, etc.) can expect 25 mm to 50 mm of rain, but in some places 100 mm may be expected.
The rain brought by Rosa may bring relief to areas not threatened by flash floods, as the area is currently suffering from severe drought.
Despite the serious threat of flooding, some of the rainfall may be beneficial to the southwestern landscape, which is struggling with drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Service, over 40% of Arizona is experiencing minimum extreme drought, which is the second most dangerous category according to a weather.com report.
Hurricane Rosa will make its first landfall on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
It will continue to remain a hurricane, and on Sunday morning, it will move south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, some 400 miles [600 km] and head north at approximately 12 miles [19 km] per hour.
The storm will meet cooler currents in the Pacific and lose strength.
So it's expected to make landfall as a tropical storm again by Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rainfall is expected in some areas of Mexico, which greatly increases the chance of flooding.
The rainfall could average 70 to 150 millimeters of precipitation from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with up to 250 millimeters of precipitation reported by weather.com.
Rosa then continues northward as a tropical storm through Mexico before hitting the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday, by which time it will have become a tropical depression, sweeping across Arizona and reaching the southern reaches of Utah by Tuesday night.
The greatest threat from Rosa and its remnants is expected to be extreme rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the desert regions of the southwestern United States, the National Hurricane Center said.
Rainfall is expected to cause life-threatening flash floods and landslides in desert areas, and landslides are to be avoided in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four people arrested on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
At 4:00 a.m. local time on Saturday, a wounded teenage boy was found in the Midsomer Norton Excelsior Terrace section of town.
The boy was rushed to the hospital in stable condition.
Police say a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in Radstock, Avon and Somerset.
Authorities are asking the public to contact anyone who has cell phone footage of what happened.
Trump says Kavanaugh has had to endure the wrath and resentment of the Democratic Party.
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is voting against the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had to suffer the wrath and resentment of the Democratic Party during his run for office.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he strongly and passionately denied Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that he had sexually assaulted her decades earlier as a teenager.
At the hearing, Ford testified and defended his earlier statements.
The president said Saturday that "Americans saw firsthand" the brilliance and fearlessness of Kavanaugh that day.
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote for one of the finest legal minds of our time, with an unblemished record of public service", he told Trump's West Virginia supporters.
The president was referring to Kavanaugh's candidacy in disguise while talking about the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections.
We're only five weeks away from making one of the most important decisions of our lives.
I'm not running personally, but I'm running, basically.
That's why I go everywhere to support the best candidates.
Trump argued that the Democrats were using a tactic of resistance and obstruction.
The first Senate vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday, a senior Republican aide told CNN.
Hundreds killed in tsunami in Indonesia earthquake, death toll rising
Many people were swept away by the flood and at least 384 people were killed when huge waves hit the coast, the disaster was caused by a strong earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, said local authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered in the town of Palu for a festival on Friday when nearly six-meter-high (18-foot) waves washed ashore at dusk, sweeping many away and destroying everything in their path.
The flood was triggered by a 7.5 earthquake.
When the tsunami warning was sounded yesterday, people simply stayed on the shore, did not immediately flee, and became victims of the waves   said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster management agency (BNPB) at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't just come in itself, it swept cars, logs, houses and everything else off the coast", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was traveling at 500 miles per hour over the open sea before it hit the coast.
Some climbed to the top of trees to escape the floodwaters, he said.
Some 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 shelters in Plymouth.
Aerial footage of the disaster released by the agency shows several ruined buildings and businesses, several twisted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, further aftershocks rocked the coastal town.
The earthquakes were felt in an area that is home to some 2.4 million people.
According to a statement from the Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Development (BPPT), the energy released by Friday's earthquake was approximately 200 times greater than the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The agency added that the city's location at the end of a long and narrow bay and the resulting geographic features may have enhanced the impact of the tsunami.
According to Nugroho, the damage caused was "significant", with thousands of homes destroyed and hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
Several bodies were found in the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that the number of injured so far is 540, and that 29 more people are being sought.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage caused in the Donggala area, 300 kilometers (190 miles) from the coast of Palau, could be even higher, as it was closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
"Communication is completely paralyzed, there is no information about Donggala", Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there, says a Red Cross statement, which also announces that the organisation's specialists and volunteers are on their way to the disaster-stricken area.
"The situation is already tragic, but it could be much worse", they added.
The agency received a lot of criticism on Saturday for not informing the public about the storm hitting Palut, but according to the management the waves had already reached the coast when the alarm was issued.
Amateur footage shared on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building making desperate cries to warn people on the street of an approaching tornado.
Within minutes, a huge wall of water slams into the shore, sweeping away cars and buildings.
Reuters has not yet been able to verify the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused power outages, cutting off communications in the Palu area, and making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has sent relief supplies from Jakarta and other cities by cargo plane, but officials say the evacuated population will still need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has been opened only to facilitate relief efforts, and will be closed for all other purposes until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers set up in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is over 800.
It's really bad.
The World Vision team arrived safely from Donggala in the city of Palu, where employees found shelter under tent poles erected in the office yard, but encountered signs of terrible destruction on their way, Doseba said.
They said they saw a lot of houses falling apart.
It's really bad.
As the relief teams began to prepare for the disaster relief work, some complained that foreign specialists with extensive experience in this field could not travel to Palua.
Indonesian regulations require that all overseas aid, relief supplies and personnel be allowed into the country only if the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
This has never happened before.
The case is still being treated as a provincial-level disaster  said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
 Once the government acknowledges that this is indeed a national disaster, we can allow international aid services in, but so far no announcement has been made.
On the second night after Friday's earthquake and flood, friends and family of the missing continued to waver in their hope that their loved ones would be among those whose miraculous survival would shed some light on the dark atmosphere of the reports of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled from the sewer during the rescue operation.
On Sunday, workers were able to rescue a woman who had been trapped in the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national figure skating team, prepared two of the missing figure skater athletes for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month, and was held in Indonesia.
Besides the missing, there are other students at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi.
"As a veteran of the war, I'm deeply affected by what happened", he said.
Gendon recalled that when news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse started to spread among the sailors, he spent hours desperately trying to reach the competitors who were attending the beach festival in Playa on WhatsApp.
But instead of two blue beads, the messages contained only one grey bead.
I guess that means the messages can't be delivered anymore.
$26,750 was stolen from an ATM while it was being recharged at the Newport on the Levee shopping mall.
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was filling an ATM with cash at the Newport on the Levee shopping center, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the money truck was unloading a cash machine at the entertainment center and was preparing to load it with more banknotes, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the release.
A man approached a Brink's employee from behind while he was busy with his work and stole one of the pre-packaged bags.
Witnesses saw several alleged perpetrators fleeing the scene, but the police statement does not list the exact number of suspects.
Anyone with information on the identity of the perpetrators can contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper's name has been changed to "Y"
Kanye West, the rapper's name is Ye.
He announced the change on Saturday on Twitter with the following message: "The entity formerly known as Kanye West".
West, 41, had been nicknamed "Ye" by several people for some time, and his eighth album, released in June, was also titled Ye.
He announced the name change before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to perform his new album, Yandhi.
She will replace Ariana Grande, who pulled out of the show citing emotional issues, the show's producer said.
The new name is not just an abbreviation of the rapper's current stage name, but also has religious significance to West, as he has previously revealed.
So I know that "Ye" is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "te" and it was mentioned earlier by West when he was talking about the title of his album with Big Boy radio host.
So I am you and I am we and we are all one.
Kanye means the one, and that's just Ye, which means the good, the bad, the confused, the all-pervading.
The album is more about who we are.
Ye is one of those famous rappers who likes to change his name.
Sean Combs, for example, has run under the names Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he now prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former co-creator, Jay-Z, has also made several variations on whether his name should be written in all-caps, with a hyphen, or with a capital letter.
The Mexican president has vowed not to use the military against civilians.
On the upcoming 50th anniversary of the bloody student protests, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has promised never to use military force against civilians.
López Obrador promised in Tlatelolco Square on Saturday that he would never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, military troops opened fire on a peaceful demonstration, killing some 300 people, as left-wing student movements showed signs of strengthening in Latin America.
López Obrador has promised to help Mexican youth by providing monthly financial aid to students and plans to establish more free public universities.
He argued that unemployment and lack of education are the two main factors that drive young people into the arms of criminal organizations.
The US should double its funding for AI solutions
As China becomes more active in AI research and development, the United States should double its funding for AI research, said Kai-Fu Lee, an AI investor and practitioner who previously worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He said this after the US government made announcements about artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the US has no official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China has announced its own plans to become the world's number one AI developer by 2030.
Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, as every other country is significantly behind the US and the next breakthrough in AI is just around the corner,  Lee said.
Doubling research funding could also double the chances of the United States making the next big step in artificial intelligence, he said in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was released this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, a company that has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that managed to defeat the best American Othello player, and later served as a member of the Microsoft Research board and as president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee acknowledged the success of previous US government technology competitions, including the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be held, as it would be an opportunity to seek out new future-builders.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get the government funding they need for their research, Lee said.
It's not China that's taking down the scientific pipeline, it's the big corporations that's adding it.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have also hired some of the biggest university minds in recent years to work in the field of AI.
Lee believes that changing immigration policy could also go a long way towards helping the US's ambitions in artificial intelligence.
"I think that you should automatically get a green card for people who have a PhD in artificial intelligence", he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China announced its plan to develop next-generation artificial intelligence.
China's National Science Foundation provides support to staff in academic institutions in a similar way to the way the US National Science Foundation (NSF) and other government organizations distribute money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee explained.
This year, the US Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, an AI center where industry experts and academics can work together, and the White House announced the creation of a select committee on artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA invested $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next,
And the NSF is currently spending $100 million a year to support AI research.
Meanwhile, the United States Congress, which had proposed the creation of a national security intelligence committee, has not taken any further action on the matter for months.
Macedonia holds a referendum on changing the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would end a decades-old dispute with Greece that has prevented the country's EU and NATO membership applications from being accepted.
Greece, whose province is called Macedonia, has argued that the name of its northern neighbour indicates that it has a claim to a Greek territory with a similar name, and has thus so far vetoed its membership of NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the new name of the state, but opponents of the national movement say the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's predominantly Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has stated that he will not participate in the referendum, and as a result of the boycott campaign launched, there are doubts about whether the 50% turnout required for a valid referendum will be achieved.
The question on the ballot paper is: "Do you support the country's membership of NATO and the EU and accept the agreement with Greece?"
The name change is spearheaded by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, who argues that it is a price worth paying to give Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the rubble of Yugoslavia, a chance at EU and NATO membership.
'I have come here today to vote for the future of the country, so that young Macedonians can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that would mean a safer life for all of us,' said Olivera Georgijevska (79) in Skopje.
Although the referendum itself is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament have indicated that they feel bound by the result of the vote.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is required to change the name.
According to the State Election Commission, as of 1pm on the day of the vote, there had been no reports of any irregularities.
However, the turnout has so far been only 16%, compared to 34% in the 2016 parliamentary elections (which saw the participation of 66% of registered voters).
I came to vote for my children because we belong in Europe said Gjose Tanevski (62), who voted in Skopje, the capital.
Zoran Zaev, the Prime Minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica, and their son Dushko voted in favor of the name change in Strumica in the referendum on 30 September 2018, which would allow the country to join the EU and NATO.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) set up a small stage, as well as chairs and tents for the boycotting the referendum.
We also support the country's membership in NATO and the EU, but we want to join with pride, with our heads held high, and not through the back door said Kavadarkov.
We may be a poor country, but we haven't lost our dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonians, then we can turn to China or Russia as part of Eurasian integration.
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership could provide investment in Macedonia, which is badly needed by a country with unemployment above 20%.
'I think the majority will support our cause, as more than 80% of the country's population is basically in favour of EU and NATO membership,' Zaev said after casting his vote.
He added that the vote would ensure the country's future.
A poll released by the Macedonian Institute of Political Studies last Monday suggests that between 30 and 43 percent of voters are expected to participate in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
Another survey by Macedonian Telma TV predicts a 57% turnout on Sunday.
Of those who want to go out to vote, 70% said they would vote yes.
For a referendum to be valid, the turnout must be at least one vote higher than 50%.
The invalidation of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government that came to power in May last year.
Manchester City player Sergio Aguero scores a goal by knocking out the entire Brighton defense.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling have been used to great effect by Brighton's defence, with Manchester City winning 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in England.
Aguero scored the goal in the 65th minute as if it were the easiest thing in the world.
The Argentine striker was given a pass in midfield as the first step of the attack, and
He's slipped through the three Brighton defenders and into the open.
And then four green men surrounded Aguero.
He took out a defender, then ran more, getting close to the Brighton Sixteen.
Then he passes to the left for Sterling, who's coming up.
The Englishman, in the sixteenth, forced the ball back to Aguero, who finished with his right foot, hitting the right side of Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan's goal.
"Aguero has problems with his leg", Pep Guardiola, Manchester City manager, told reporters.
We agreed that you could play 55 minutes, 60 at the most.
And that's what happened.
Luckily, he scored a goal.
Sterling's action has given the Blues the initial advantage in the English championship clash.
The goal came in the 29th minute, when
Aguero, who is in the Brighton's cross-country, has a great pass.
He throws a beautiful crossball to Leroy Sane on the left wing.
Sane played with the ball for a while before he put Sterling on the long end.
The Blue's battle was that he could barely get the ball in the goal before it slipped out of the end zone.
City will next play at the Rhein-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany, on Tuesday at 12:55 in the Champions League against Hoffenheim.
Scherzer wants to make things harder for the Rockies.
With the Nationals having missed the opportunity to make the postseason, they had no reason to really push.
But Scherzer, who is always competitive, can't wait to take the field against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the opposing team still has a chance in the playoffs.
The Rockies have secured at least one consolation game with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but their first division title is still up for grabs.
Regardless of the fact that we're out of luck, we can take them on with the crowd and the other team in Denver expecting their mood to be at its peak for the year.
Of course I want to be on the field like this!
The Nationals have yet to select a starting pitcher for Sunday, but word is that in this situation, Scherzer will be the pitcher.
Scherzern, who participated in a pitching practice on Thursday, will make his 34th start on Sunday, which is his day off.
The right-handed Washington player is 18-7 this season with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts after 220 and 2/3 innings.
Trump campaigning in West Virginia
The president also made a veiled reference to the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections.
In November, everything we've accomplished is at stake.
We're only five weeks away from one of the most important decisions of our lives.
This is one of the big ones, the big ones. I'm not running personally, but I'm running, so I go everywhere to support the best candidates.
Trump went on to say, "You can see what these horrible, radical Democratic groups are doing, you can see it with your own eyes.
They are determined, and whatever means they can use to regain power, they are malicious and vicious.
It doesn't matter who they hurt, who they crush, to get control, to get power, that's what they want, control and power, but we're not going to give up.
The president says the Democrats are gonna use resistance and obstruction.
He's been watching all this for the last four days, he said, calling the Democrats angry and malicious and sneaky and liars.
He mentioned by name Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to whom the crowd had voiced its displeasure.
Do you remember what he said?
You leaked the document?
Uh, what?
No, uh, no, wait, all this really bad body language, that was the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party no longer supports diversity.
He does not tolerate those who freely express their opinions
I was not at all surprised when Momentum activists in my own party decided to censor me.
After all, I'm just the latest in a long line of Labour MPs to be told they're not welcome simply because we said what we thought.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way for her unwavering opposition to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censors didn't like that I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
And the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security and on Europe, which, ironically, are the very issues on which Jeremy also disagreed with previous leaders.
The invitation to the Labour Party meeting in Nottingham East on Friday said that they wanted a productive and inclusive meeting.
For most of the eight years I was a local Labour MP, these Friday night meetings were exactly like this.
But today, unfortunately, the tone has changed, and the promise of a more restrained, more polite politics has been forgotten, if it has ever been fulfilled.
It is becoming increasingly apparent that the Labour Party does not tolerate dissent and judges every opinion on its acceptability to the party leadership.
This trend started not long after Jeremy became the leader of the couple, and colleagues who I thought shared our political views were increasingly expected to turn their backs on my personal opinions and take a stand on things that they would never otherwise agree with, whether it be on national security issues or the single European market.
After every public speech I make, regardless of what I actually say, people start to mock me on social media, demanding that I be removed, criticizing the politics of the middle class, and telling me that I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
This isn't just happening to me.
In fact, I know that I'm luckier than many of my colleagues, because the comments I get are usually limited to politics.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my fellow politicians who are forced to face sexist and racist attacks on a daily basis, and yet they don't run away.
The most frustrating aspect of today's politics is that attacks of this scale have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn last week spoke of the need for Labour to promote a culture of tolerance.
But the reality is that we've given up diversity, and with every appeal to mistrust and every change in the election rules, the number of converts in the party is getting smaller.
Over the years, many have advised me to keep my mouth shut, to be less talkative, and then everything would be fine.
But that's not why I got into politics.
32 years ago, I joined the Labour Party as a student, outraged by the Thatcher government's neglect of schools, which left our classrooms almost derelict, and then fought for better public services for the most deprived as a local councillor and a government minister.
I have never hidden my political views, and I did not do otherwise in the last election.
It was clear to everyone in Nottingham East what my political views were and what issues I disagreed with the current leadership on.
To those who voted in favour of the motion on Friday, I want to say that at this juncture, when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will hurt not only families but also businesses and public services, I don't see why I should spend so much time and energy questioning my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But my most important message is not to the members of the Nottingham Moment, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour Party members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of displacement or political purpose will deter me from acting on my own judgment and in the best interests of all.
Chris Leslie, Member of the House of Commons for Nottingham East
Ayr Melrose 3817 Ayr tops the mountain with no defeat
Two late attempts may have altered the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved victory in the most entertaining match of the day, the Tennent Premiership.
The team is currently at the top of the table, the only undefeated team in the top ten.
Their unparalleled defense and superior positioning have won the game, so the home team and coach Peter Murchie have every reason to be pleased.
"We have had to face many challenges in our previous matches, but we are still unbeaten, so I have every reason to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie, the Melrose player, said: "We have to admit that Ayr took advantage of his situation much more than we did".
A 14th-minute try by Grant Anderson, which was scored by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead, and a yellow card from Scottish captain Rory Hughes, loaned by the Warriors, meant that Melrose could have scored the difference, but Jason Baggot's try was not scored.
Climo took a penalty to the Ayr defense, just in the half, and then a one-man attempt to score, bringing the first half to 17-5 in Ayr's favour.
Melrose started strongly in the second half, selling Patrick Anderson's shot to Baggo, reducing the team's deficit to five points.
The game then went into a long stoppage as Ruaridh Knott suffered a serious injury and had to be carried off the pitch, and in the sequel Ayr further increased their advantage by trying to Stafford McDowall, whose feathers were reaped with the help of Climo.
Ayr's captain, Blair Macpherson, was also given a yellow card, and Melrose was able to foil Bruce Colvine's attempt, breaking the pressure on them.
The home team was starting to catch up again, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for putting Climo out without a ball, MacPherson was on the line for a touchdown behind Ayr's rushing team.
Climo sold, which he repeated almost immediately after the reset when Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's high kick and sent forward Gregor Henry's switch to the home team's fifth try.
The star of Still Game has embarked on a new career in the hospitality industry.
It seems that Still Game star Ford Kieran is moving into the hospitality industry, as it has been revealed that he is the CEO of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he co-writes and co-stars with his long-time comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The pair have announced that the ninth season will be their final season, and it seems Kiernan is already planning for life after Craiglang.
According to the official records, he became the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor has not commented on the news, although a source in the Scottish Sun has suggested Kiernan is trying to cash in on Glasgow's booming hospitality industry.
The sea is ours: Landlocked Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
Marine patrols around the sail-decked naval headquarters in La Paz.
The flags of our ocean are flying over the buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, naval bases are proclaiming the motto: "We have a right to the sea.
It's our duty to get it back.
Bolivia, a landlocked country, still has the remnants of a lost coast that was seized by Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century, and it is eager to re-experience the waves of the Pacific.
These hopes have perhaps been strengthened the most in decades, as Bolivia awaits the International Court's verdict on October 1st, which will conclude five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the ball, and it is spreading the spirit of unity and peace among the people, who are waiting for the outcome with optimism", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians are watching the International Court of Justice ruling in the hope that the Hague tribunal will side with Bolivia and that after decades of Chile's rhapsodic attitude, it will be forced to sit at the negotiating table to give Bolivia independent access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president  who faces a controversial battle for reelection next year  could lose a lot by Monday's ruling.
We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean, he said at the end of August.
Some analysts, however, feel that the court is unlikely to rule in Bolivia's favor, and even if it does, it would not make much difference.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no jurisdiction over Chilean territory and has also agreed that it will not influence the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice's judgment came just six months after the closing arguments indicates that the case was not complicated, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And the last four years have not only helped the Bolivian cause, but even rejected it.
The issue of the sea gateway has been diverted by the current Bolivian government for its own purposes explained Zárate.
Morales's hostile rhetoric has also lost the goodwill of the rest of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will certainly continue to negotiate at some point, but after what happened, it will be extremely difficult to initiate a dialogue.
The two countries have not delegated ambassadors to each other since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, disagreed with the finding that the court decision was unusually quick.
Monday will bring a unique opportunity for Bolivia to open a new chapter in relations with Chile and a chance for both countries to come out of 139 years of conflict, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, had used the maritime dispute to his political advantage.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to the Pacific Ocean", he added.
 The judgment provides an opportunity to see that it is time to move on.
North Korea: No denuclearization until they can trust America
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho says his country will not be the first to dismantle its nuclear weapons if Washington cannot be trusted.
Ri spoke before the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made at the Singapore summit between the leaders of the two rival countries.
The comments came as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to have resumed stalled nuclear talks more than three months after his Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
Ri said he hoped that continued sanctions and American obstruction of the Korean declaration would ever be enough to bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration unless Pyongyang takes significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump want a new summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism about Phenjan's commitment to disarmament, which he sees as the only key to the country's security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Phenyan next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion shows have introduced the giant headdresses that will soon be in high-end stores.
If you want to expand your hat collection or if you want to hide the sun altogether, you don't have to look any further.
Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of unusually oversized headgear as part of their spring/summer 2019 collection, which was received with great enthusiasm by the stylish audience of the Paris fashion week.
Unpractical hats created a sensation on Instagram this summer, and the designers above have put their attention-grabbing creations on the runway.
Valentino's most spectacular piece was an exaggerated beige hat, which was decorated with a featherlike, wide handle and almost completely absorbed the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included a jewel-encrusted turnip, a magic hat, and even a pineapple, which were not really designed to keep a person's head warm.
And Thom Browne also came up with a bizarre selection of masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had their mouths stitched together and were more reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One of these was shaped like a diving mask, complete with a pipe and glasses, and another looked like a melting pot of ice cream.
If you're going to get these spectacular pieces, you're in luck.
Fashion analysts predict that the giant hats may be on their way to the top of the fashion chain.
The oversized hats follow the path trodden by La Bomba, a two-foot-wide straw hat that we've seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind the impractical hat that has captured the community pages has unveiled a new piece on the runway: a beach bag made of straw that is almost as big as the swimsuit model holding it.
The dark orange ruffle bag  decorated with ruffles and topped with a white leather handle  was one of the highlights of the Jacquemus La Riviera spring/summer 2019 collection at the Paris fashion show.
Stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL, "I expect to see huge hats and beach bags in high-end clothing stores by next summer". The designer has created such an elementary effect from everyone that it's hard to deny the demand for oversized accessories.
John Edward: language skills are essential for global citizenship
Scottish independent schools have traditionally provided an excellent education, and recent outstanding test scores show that this has not changed by 2018, reinforced by individual and group successes in sports, the arts, music and other community initiatives.
In Scotland, over 30 000 students are already enrolled in such institutions, which are represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) and which strive to provide the best possible service to pupils and parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare students for further education, higher education, their chosen careers, and their place as global citizens.
In an education sector where there is scope for designing and implementing customised school curricula, we see that modern languages continue to prove to be popular and sought-after subjects.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a person in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
But if you speak in his language, it goes to his heart.
This is an important reminder, because we can't rely solely on English to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year's test results show that students from independent schools across the country have scored the best in foreign languages.
68% of all foreign language students achieved a higher A grade (over 85%).
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools show that 72 percent of students received an A grade in Mandarin, while 72 percent of German learners, 69 percent of French learners, and 63 percent of Spanish learners received an A grade.
These results also support the view that foreign languages are essential skills for Scottish independent schools and will undoubtedly be needed by children and young people in the future.
Today, languages as elective subjects have become at least as important as science, technology, engineering and mathematics, both in independent schools and in other types of schools.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Vocational Training found that 17% of employers said that lack of language skills made it difficult to fill vacancies.
This also shows that language skills are becoming increasingly necessary for young people to have a successful career.
As more and more jobs require knowledge of foreign languages, language skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career you choose, learning a foreign language is a lifelong skill that can bring you clear benefits.
Being able to communicate directly with other nationalities automatically gives the applicant who speaks several languages a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov survey of 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% of respondents did not speak any foreign language well enough to engage in conversation, and French was the only language spoken by more than 10% of respondents (15%).
That's why it's important to focus on language education for children now.
Speaking more than one language, especially in developing countries, can be a tool in the hands of children, equipping them with the skills they need to apply for more important jobs as adults.
In Scotland, each school will have a different language.
Many schools will focus on classical modern languages, while many will teach languages such as Mandarin or Japanese, which are expected to be of prime importance to the UK by 2020.
Whatever the child's interests, he or she will have several languages of choice to learn in independent schools and will be trained by teachers who are experts in their field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment for children that prepares and equips them with the skills they will need to succeed, whatever the future holds.
It is not difficult to see that in today's global business environment, languages remain vital to a country's future, and education should reflect this.
In fact, knowledge of modern languages should be treated as an international communication skill.
Independent schools offer Scotland's young people a choice of education, diversity and quality.
It's got to be done.
John Edward, Chairman of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron is going to San Diego with the Lakers on Sunday.
It won't be long before fans who've been waiting for a pin to come out of the closet will see LeBron James take the field for the first time with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the preseason opener Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he'll spend on the court is a question.
"More than one, and less than 48", Walton wrote on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers broadcaster Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play for a limited time.
A few days ago, after practice, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason.
"At this point in my career, I don't have to play in the preseason to be ready", he said.
Trump's West Virginia campaign and YouTube channel
Donald Trump is starting a long series of campaign events tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This will be the first of five events Trump has announced for next week, including stops like the Tennessee and Mississippi that support him.
Now that the vote to confirm his nominee to fill the Supreme Court seat has been postponed, Trump is looking to rally supporters for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the votes roll in November.
What time does Trump's West Virginia event start tonight, and where can we watch it online?
Trump's speech in Wheeling, West Virginia, will begin this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 a.m. eastern time.
You can also watch Trump's West Virginia rally online via his YouTube live stream.
Trump is also likely to be affected by the hearing this week of future Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which has proven to be particularly tense in light of the sexual harassment allegations, and the Senate confirmation vote has been suspended for up to a week while the FBI investigates.
But the primary purpose of the sudden increase in events is to help the Republican Party's position in the November election.
Trump's campaign adviser says the five events next week will serve to activate voters and supporters as Republicans try to protect and increase the majority they currently hold in the Senate and House of Representatives.
"Having control of Congress in his hands is so critical to his political plans that the president is going to as many states as possible", "We're looking at a busy campaign season",
Tonight's event at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could bring in supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and even get coverage in the Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia in the past month, the state where he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is not favored in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has to personally step in to get a better showing in the polls", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA struggling with full shoulder width in Sunday's individual to keep hope alive
After three one-sided attempts, the Ryder Cup needed a four-way match on Saturday afternoon.
The swaying shirt of luck and momentum is a rather airy concept in sport, yet it's one that all players believe in, especially in competitions like the Ryder Cup.
So who's got the ball now?
"They had a six-point lead, and now they're only up by four, so we can say we have the ball right now", Jordan Spieth said as he walked away at the end of the day.
Of course, with four points, Europe still leads, and there are 12 more to go.
The Americans, Spieth tells us, feel like they finally got a little back up and can draw encouragement from a lot of things, including the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both got three out of four.
Spieth proved to be infallible from the opening shot to the hole, and his performance was exemplary.
Öblös's victory cries grew louder as he advanced through the round, being slowed by a critical pitch and equalised in the fourth match, leaving him and Thomas two-by-two.
The decisive turn of the match produced a cheerful outcry on the 15th hole, one that could lead the spectator to believe that all was not lost for the American team.
"You just have to dig deep inside yourself and just worry about your own game", Spieth said.
That's exactly what's waiting for players.
18 holes for a chance to leave a trail.
In the last two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the most popular pair in the Ryder Cup, have been able to score more points than Spieth and Thomas.
Europe's weird, but adorable pair of four-of-fours, and they don't seem to be able to go wrong.
Mollywood was the only pair to not exceed par on Saturday afternoon, and to have similar performances on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the final nine stages of Friday morning.
Thanks to this series and the dynamic between them and the crowd, who are loudly supporting them, they have become the benchmark for Sunday, and no one is more expected to ensure Europe's victory at Le Golf National by the sunset than Fleetwood or Molinari.
The best would be a win at one hole at a time.
But it would be premature to celebrate the victory of the Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson were quick to execute Sergio Garcia, the morning's four-man hero, when he was playing with Alex Noren.
Once one and twice two strokes over the bank, the Spaniard and the Swede completed the first nine holes, which sent them into a wave valley from which they had no chance to climb out.
But on Sunday, there'll be no one to help you out of your hole.
Four-ball games and foursomes are very entertaining to watch up close because of the interactions between the partners, and you can see who is giving advice and who is not, and how strategy can change in the blink of an eye.
Europe has been better as a team so far, and it's a big lead going into the final day, but this section of four showed that the American team has the courage to fight, even though many of them, mostly on the American side, are missing.
Europe starts the final day of the Ryder Cup with a 10-6 lead.
Europe has a clear lead heading into the final day of the Ryder Cup, having won Saturday's four-ball and four-ball matches by a score of 10-6 against the United States.
The spirited Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the pack, taking two wins over the failing Tiger Woods, bringing the gap to four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjørn's European team, looking to reclaim the trophy they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the ever-erring American team in the morning's four-ball matches, winning the series 3-1.
The Americans put up a big fight in the fourth, winning two games, but they still couldn't close the gap.
Jim Furyk's team will need eight points from Sunday's 12 individual games to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a series, while he and Molinari, who are remembered only as "Molliwoods" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in their opening four games.
After beating Woods' Patrick Reed in the four-ball, they beat the unmotivated Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau by a decisive 5-4 in a superb team effort.
Woods, who had been dragging himself through two games on Saturday, sometimes showed his talent, but in 29 games, he's lost 19 of his fours and fours, seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning foursomes, returned to his partner Henrik Stenson and in the foursomes, he defeated the pair of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the world's number one and number three.
But Europe didn't fare so well on this pleasant, windy day southwest of Paris.
With three-time defending champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas' two-point game Saturday, he showed the Americans how to do it.
They won a miserable 2 and 1 against the Spanish pair of Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fours, and later came back to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in the fours after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point deficit in the individual competition, although Furyk's defending champions are one point away from retaining the trophy.
But after two days of being second best, a Sunday counterattack seems unlikely.
It's impossible for North Korea to disarm unilaterally if it doesn't trust its negotiating partner.
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that the sanctions' continued implementation has only increased the mistrust of the United States and that it is impossible for the country to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Jongho told the world body's annual general assembly that North Korea had taken "significant and generous steps" during the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, closing its nuclear test site, and pledging not to expand its nuclear arsenal and the range of nuclear technology.
"But we're not seeing a similar response from the Americans", he said.
 With the lack of confidence in America, we feel that our national security is not assured and that in these circumstances, we cannot unilaterally and first disarm.
While Ri reiterated North Korea's disappointment that Washington opposes the idea of a "second-stage" nuclear disarmament, which would see North Korea receive rewards for the steps taken so far, his statement seemed meaningless because he did not explicitly reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang has done so far.
Ri cited a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader, held in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to work toward the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, while Trump guaranteed the inviolability of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has insisted that Pyongyang first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington has not eased the stringent international sanctions against North Korea.
"America insists that we start with nuclear disarmament, and it is increasing the pressure with sanctions to impose its will on us, and it is also protesting against whoever can declare the end of the war", Ri said.
The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream of people who don't know us.
The problem is that the unmitigated sanctions only increase our suspicion.
Ri did not mention that a second summit between Kim and Trump was planned, but the US president mentioned it separately at the UN earlier in the week.
The minister instead pointed out that there had been three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Munt Jin in the past five months, and added: "If the country involved in the denuclearization was South Korea, and not the United States, then the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a deadlock".
However, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that the North Korean missiles would inevitably target the North American continent, after Trump, the evil president, called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
At the UN this year, Trump - who last year threatened complete destruction of North Korea - showered praise on Kim for having the courage to take steps towards denuclearization, but also noted that there was still much work to be done and that sanctions would remain in place until North Korea finally went nuclear.
On Wednesday, Trump said that they didn't set a time limit, so whether it's two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't matter.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions so far.
In contrast, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council sanctions must be unabashedly enforced until we achieve actual, final, verifiable nuclear disarmament".
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously maintained sanctions against North Korea in order to curb funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Rili during a break at the UN General Assembly, and then said he would travel to Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo's been to North Korea three times this year, but his latest trip didn't go well.
After leaving Pyongyang in July, he announced that progress had been made, but North Korea accused him hours later of making gangster-like claims.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile base and a nuclear facility if the United States takes appropriate action.
Mun said the steps Kim mentioned would be security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps that could lead to normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taught to get enough rest
A new Harvard University course this year has encouraged students to get more sleep, in a bid to combat the increasingly macho culture of caffeinated, all-night studying.
One academic concluded that students at the world's top universities are often completely lost when it comes to how to care for themselves.
The course, which it claims is the first of its kind in the United States, was designed by Professor Charles Czeisler, who teaches sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and is a practicing physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
The impetus for the course was a lecture he gave earlier on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
And finally, a girl came to me and said, "Why am I facing this now, as a senior?"
He said that no one had ever talked to him about the importance of sleep, which was a surprise, he told the Telegraph.
The course, launched for the first time this year, will teach students how good sleep habits have a fundamental impact on their academic and athletic performance, as well as having a positive impact on their overall well-being.
According to Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the university's health care service, the university decided to start the course because students were found to be extremely sleepy during the week.
The one-hour course also includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one, they show a picture of a dorm room where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how sleep deprivation affects athletic performance, and why bedtime routines matter.
Another section explains to the participants how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
They present a map of the campus with interactive icons to encourage participants to reflect on their daily routine.
We know that we're not going to change the behavior of students right away.
But we think they have a right to this knowledge, just as they have a right to be aware of the health effects of smoking, Professor Czeisler said.
A culture of achievement in studying overnight continues to flourish, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students are causing sleep deprivation to become a growing problem.
Getting enough and quality sleep is the secret weapon students use to combat stress, exhaustion, anxiety, and even obesity, since sleep deprivation forces the brain into a starvation mode and causes a constant feeling of hunger.
Raymond So, who helped Professor Czeisler design the course, is a 19-year-old California student studying chemistry and biophysics, and last year, at Harvard, he was the first to take one of his courses.
He said that what he heard there opened his eyes and encouraged him to push for a university-level education.
It hopes that postgraduate students will be able to participate in a similar training programme as a next step before they enter the competitive field.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set an alarm for bedtime, an alarm for waking up, and familiarize themselves with the harmful effects of blue light from electric screens and LED lights, which can easily distract them from their daily routine and make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston at Rangers 1-0: Menga defeats Gerrard's men and scores a goal
The Rangers suffered another defeat in the outfield when Dolly Menga's bomb dropped Steven Gerrard's team to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibroxies were looking to claim their first away win since a 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gerrard suffered his second defeat to Gary Holt in his 18 games as manager, leaving them eight points behind the Ladbrokes Premiership's current champions, Hearts.
Menga struck seven minutes before halftime, and the Rangers' unmotivated team came nowhere near the equaliser.
While Rangers slipped to sixth, Livingston climbed to third, just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
The Rangers are also facing additional difficulties after co-coach Calum Spence sustained a head injury from an object that was apparently dropped from the visitors' lounge.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that beat Ayr to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt and Livingston entered the field with the same 11 men who took a point away from the Hearts last week, and he would have been happy to see his team squash their opponent's game wherever it found him.
Although the Rangers led the way in possession, Livingston was able to go further with what he had.
They could have scored in the first two minutes when Menga's first inning sent Scott Pittman to the goal of Allan McGregor, but the center failed to sell the puck.
Keaghan Jacobs' low free kick landed on team captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, only hit the side of the gate.
The Rangers took control, but they were more hopeful in their play in the final third than confident.
Alfredo Morelos clearly felt he deserved a penalty in the 15th minute when he collided with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson dismissed his complaints to Colombia.
The Rangers were able to score only two first-half goals, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly bothered by Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
Although Livi's attempt in the 34th minute was against the previous course of the match, no one can deny that they deserved the chance, even if it was only for their hard work.
The Rangers have missed another Jacobs-forced-out-of-the-court game.
Scott Arfield was out of time when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who found Menga perfect for the easy finish.
Gerrard decided at halftime, replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and it had an almost immediate effect on the game as the outfield teased Morelos, but Kelly, who was bringing impressive form, blocked in time.
Livingston continued to play the game he liked, and Lithgow and Halkett swept up the long balls one after the other.
Holt's team could have taken a bigger lead in the last few minutes, but McGregor grabbed the net and hit Jacobs's position before Lithgow went off the scent.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton tried to fight off another 11 when he collided with Jacobs, but Thompson was unable to convince him this time.
Almanach: the inventor of the Geiger counter
A little something from our Sunday morning almanac: September 30, 1882, exactly 136 years ago today... the day the late physicist, Johannes Wilhelm Hansen Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that would later become known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has since become a staple of science and a part of popular culture thanks to the 1950s film "Bells of Coronado" starring the eccentric cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: This is a Geiger counter, and it's used to search for radioactive minerals, like uranium.
If you put on this headset, you can hear the sound of atoms emitted by the radioactivity of minerals.
Evans: "Listen, this is a very good time".
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But his invention lives on.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to spot abnormal cells
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to detect and destroy abnormal cells
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise abnormal cells.
Part of the process involves extracting immune cells from the patient and then modifying them in a lab.
So they can see the protein that's associated with many types of cancer, and the treated immune cells are injected back into the patient.
An experimental vaccine has shown promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize abnormal cells was able to say good-bye to ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient; modifying them in the laboratory to capture the protein HER2, a common carrier of many cancers; and then transplanting the cells back.
Jay Berzofsky, a professor at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, U.S.A., said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and rectal cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach, which involves targeting immune cells and training them to attack cancer cells, has been used successfully in the past to treat a type of leukemia.
The MAGA-hat-wearing Kanye West's SNL act culminated in a vitriolic tirade in support of Trump.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed off Saturday Night Live after a disconnected performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and then announced that he would run for president in 2020.
After performing the third song of the night, "Ghost Town", in his Make America Great Again cap, he began to speak out against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
A lot of times when I talk to someone who is white, they ask the question, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
If I was interested in racism, I'd have left America a long time ago.
SNL's Matt Damon opened with a parody of Hollywood star Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the allegations of sexual harassment against Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not aired, a video of West's speech was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear whether Rock was trying to make fun of West by uploading the video.
West even complained to the audience that he was teased behind the scenes for his hat.
I was intimidated behind the scenes.
They said you should go out in that hat.
They intimidated me!
And they said I was in the sunken place.
West continued, "You want to see a sunken place? I'm going to put on my Superman coat, because that means they can't tell me what to do. You want the world to move forward?
Try the love.
His remarks were accompanied by at least two whistles from the audience, and the SNL cast was visibly uncomfortable, according to an eyewitness who told Variety: "The entire studio was silenced".
West was invited to the show at the last minute to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West raised questions about the song "I Love It" when he performed it wearing Perrier glasses.
West was assured of his support by the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, in a tweet: "To one of the bravest souls:
Karen Hunter, a talk show host, tweeted that West was just being himself, and that's great.
But I have decided NOT to reward (by buying their music or their fashion items or by supporting their art) someone who I believe is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to the community to which I belong.
He's free.
But what did you do to him?
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name to the person formerly known as Kanye West.
He's not the first artist to change his name to follow in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P. Diddy.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg also took on the name Snoop Lion, and of course, the late legend Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
The Belfast restaurant clerk is charged with attempted murder.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
According to the police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The accused is due in Belfast City Court on Monday.
The charges are being reviewed by the D.A.'s office.
Kit Harington, star of Game of Thrones, finds that exaggerated masculinity is harmful.
Kit Harington is best known as Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, and in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series, he often wields a sword himself.
However, the 31-year-old actor spoke out against stereotypical macho heroes, pointing out that in the face of such heroes, young boys can often feel that tough action is needed to earn respect.
In a statement to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he thought "something went wrong" and raised the question of how to deal with the problem of the damaging impact of exaggerated masculinity in the #MeToo era.
The star, who recently married fellow actress Rose Leslie, 31, said he thought it was important to address the issue.
"I'm personally deeply affected by this case. How did the depiction of masculinity get so distorted?" the actor asked.
What did we teach men in their childhood about the problem we're facing now?
Kit also blames television for the perversion of masculinity, since the shows often feature very masculine characters.
Continuing the discussion, he added: "What is born with us and what is learned?
What is the message that the streets and the TV send to young boys that makes them feel that this is the only way they can be men?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time and how we can change that.
Because it's obvious that there's something wrong with young men.
Kit stated in the interview that after the summer season of the series, he will not appear in any of the series or sequels of Game of Thrones, because he is tired of the battlefields and horses.
Starting in November, she will star in a remake of Kit Sam Shepard's True West, about a producer and his brother who lives a life of robbery.
The actor said the best thing he got from "Game of Thrones" was his wife, Rose, who he met while working on the show.
"I met my wife on the set, and I owe my future family and my life to the show", Kit said.
She played Rose Ygritte, who was Kit's love interest in Jon Snow's Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China's new cases have increased by 14%
China has announced that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in the country has increased by 14%.
Health officials say that this represents more than 820,000 cases.
The number of reported cases increased by around 40 000 in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
A change from the previous cases is that a significant majority of newly infected people contract the disease sexually.
The disease had previously spread rapidly in parts of China through transfusions of infected blood.
However, health officials at a conference in Yunnan province said that the number of such cases has since dropped to almost zero.
Yet, compared to the previous year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality has not been a crime in China since 1997, but discrimination against the community has been very strong ever since.
Various studies estimate that because of the country's conservative values, between 70 and 90 percent of men who have sex with other men end up marrying women.
In many cases, the disease is transmitted through inappropriate sexual protection.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has provided universal access to HIV medicines as part of a program to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that one of her staff members leaked the data of Republican senators and condemns the dangerous lies and conspiracy theories
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff published the personal information of three Republican senators on the senators' Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations were spread by right-wing pundits and websites.
"Lies, lies and more vile lies", Waters wrote on Twitter.
The leaked information allegedly included the addresses and phone numbers of Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information was posted online on Thursday, by an unknown person, but it was certainly posted from Capitol Hill during the Senate hearing on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's sexual harassment case.
The leak happened shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState have linked the source to an IP address linked to Waters' office, and have shared details of a member of Waters' staff, according to The Hill.
"These allegations are completely unfounded, false and obviously false", Waters continued.
My staff members are not held responsible for any leaks, but their right to anonymity, privacy and security has been violated by the fraudulent and false accusations.
These accusations are completely unfounded, false, and obviously false.
Waters' comments were quickly met with criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
This is a furious denial, written by Fleischer.
On this basis, it appears that Waters lacks the temperament necessary for the office of a representative.
If a man is accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't react angrily.
You can't be a cocky guy.
You can't question the prosecution's motives.
You need to stay calm and collected.
Fleischer apparently compared Waters' reaction to Judge Kavanaugh's reaction to Democratic critics, who some critics said seemed too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, running as the Republican candidate for the Waters seat in the midterm elections, also shared his opinion on Twitter.
If it's true, then it's a serious thing you wrote in your note.
Waters said in a statement that his office had notified "the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies" of the false allegations.
"We will ensure that the identity of the perpetrators is revealed", continued Waters, "and that they are held legally responsible for all acts that endanger or harm any member of my staff".
Johnny English is back in action, or Rowan Atkinson's lame spy game.
It's now a tradition to look for references to Brexit in all British films, and the Johnny English franchise is no exception, with the first installment, Johnny English, released in 2003 and the second, Johnny English Reloaded, in 2011.
Will the new British export be sarcastic self-parody satires that profit from our own obvious laziness?
What is certain is that the dreadful, rubber-faced, incompetent Johnny English had ample ammunition for another comeback. And it's clear from his name that this comic character was created to be laughed at by the masses of theaters in non-English-speaking countries around the world.
Johnny English, of course, is a shallow secret agent who imagines himself to be charming with his bizarre mannerisms, which reminds him a little of Inspector Clouseau, sometimes Mr. Bean, and occasionally the guy who, with the press of a button, contributed to the performance of the Firebird theme song at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
The character was originally based on the mysterious international traveler who Atkinson once played in a long-forgotten Barclaycard TV ad, and who left a trail of chaos in his wake.
There are a couple of good moments in the latest Johnny English movie.
I loved the way Johnny English, wearing medieval armor, approached a helicopter, and then, when he got there, the rotors clicked on his helmet for a few moments.
Atkinson's comic streak is well-established in the film, but the humor of the film does not really work, and even seems superfluous, since franchises with serious sound nowadays, such as the James Bond films or the Mission Impossible series, are boldly using the humor tool.
I feel that the humor of the film is more geared towards children, and for me, Johnny English's witty, misguided adventures do not reach the level of ingenuity and genius that Atkinson brings to the silent scenes of Mr. Bean.
The film's premise is unmistakable: Britain is in grave danger.
A cybercriminal has hacked into the British spy network's super-secret online network and revealed the identities of all the British agents, much to the dismay of the agent in charge, Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately only got a small role in the film.
This may be the final nail in the coffin of the arrogant and divisive Prime Minister whose political popularity is already in tatters: Emma Thompson plays Theresa May, and she brings out the best in her otherwise poorly written character.
His intelligence advisors tell him that since all active agents have been identified, he must hire a retired agent to do the job.
This retired agent is, of course, none other than the two-armed Johnny English, who has been teaching at a prestigious school since his retirement, but is teaching kids to spy in a way that is out of the ordinary. Of course, there are some funny scenes, while English is teaching the basics of spying in a rock-school way.
English is quickly transported to Whitehall, where he is reunited with his former long-suffering gun-carrier, Bough, who is now played by Ben Miller, at the emergency briefing.
Bough has since married a submarine captain who is always full of it. Captain Pepperdine is the one who's been called to do better than that.
So the two-armed Batman and Robin of Her Majesty's National Security Service are back in action, facing off against Ophelia Bulletova, played by the beautiful Olga Kurylenko, as a true woman of destiny.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is increasingly being seduced by a charismatic IT billionaire who claims to be the answer to Britain's digital problems, Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their clown mission by posing as waiters to set fire to a posh French restaurant, then sneak onto Volta's luxury yacht amidst a spectacular uproar, and English unleashes a real-life hell when he uses a VR headset to try to learn about Volta's apartment.
These are the stations needed to get to the end, but as cheerful and whimsical as it was, it's a little too much of a children's film.
The end result is pretty mediocre.
As with all the other Johnny English films, I was left wondering if the British film industry could finally give Rowan Atkinson a role worthy of her talent.
The British Labour Party denies that it would introduce a four-day work week while paying the British five-day wage
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is working on a radical proposal to introduce a four-day working week, all by making workers work for five days' pay.
The party reportedly wants workers to benefit from the AI revolution by giving bosses extra days off due to increased revenue.
Under the plan, workers would get a three-day weekend, while taking home the same amount of time as they do now.
According to sources, the idea is embedded in the party's economic program, which aims to shift the balance of power in the country to the workers.
The idea of a four-day workweek is supported by the Trades Union Congress, which believes that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour official told the Sunday Times: 'The review of the policy is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
Although it won't happen overnight, the four-day workweek is an idea that fits well into the party's program to promote workers' interests in the economy, and it also fits into the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party campaigned on the promise of a four-day work week in the 2017 general election.
However, the idea does not enjoy the support of the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day workweek is not a policy the party supports and it is not even on the agenda".
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell presented his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy at last week's Labour Conference.
McDonnell said he's determined to wrest power back from the corrupt CEOs and the corporate profiteers.
If the shadow finance minister's plans were to be implemented, the water companies' shareholders would not get back their full profits, as a Labour government would impose deductions as a punishment for alleged harmful activities.
McDonnell also confirmed that he planned to include workers on the board of directors and to set up Inclusive Ownership Funds, which would transfer 10% of the shares of private sector companies to employees, who could receive up to £500 a year in dividends.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy have revealed on 60 Minutes that the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh may change their minds.
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh will be postponed at least a week from its original date, and the final vote on Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court will be held at a time when the results of the investigation will be so uncertain that Republicans will not support Kavanaugh.
In an interview with 60 Minutes, to be aired Sunday, reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed less committed than his South Carolina counterpart.
I mean, of course, what Kennedy said.
I said that before the hearing, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the case broke, after the charges were brought, and I said, "Did you?"
His answer was firm and clear.
Graham's vote, however, seems to be a sure thing.
"I've already made my decision on Brett Kavanaugh, and it would take extremely serious charges to change my mind", Graham said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know that Brett has strenuously denied the allegations, adding that Graham was addressed to Christine Blasey Ford.
And none of the people Dr. Ford named have been proven guilty.
It's a 36-year-old story.
I don't think anything new will come out.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it succeeded in reducing poverty?
This Saturday, the annual Global Citizen Music Festival begins in New York, where world stars come together to speak out for a noble cause: ending global poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh year, is expected to draw tens of thousands of people to the Great Lawn of Central Park, where they can not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also draw attention to the event's real purpose: to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival was first held in 2012 as part of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that aims to end poverty by involving more people in the active fight against poverty.
The concert is free for those who undertake certain tasks or 'actions' (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), such as volunteering, sending an email to a leading politician, making a phone call, or any other meaningful activity that can raise awareness of the project's goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen actually been in achieving its goals over the past 12 years?
Is rewarding people with concert tickets really an effective way to convince others of the importance of action, or is it just another form of what is called click activism, where people feel they have made a meaningful contribution to a cause by signing an online petition or writing a Twitter message?
Since 2011, according to Global Citizen data, more than 19 million actions have been taken by project supporters, serving a wide range of purposes.
According to the organization, these actions have helped to mobilize $37 billion for anti-poverty policies and commitments by world leaders that could impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group claimed 390 commitments and declarations to have come from its actions, of which $10 billion had already been paid or raised through fundraising.
The group estimates that the money raised has directly impacted the lives of nearly 649 million people.
Key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and contractors dedicated to helping children reach their potential, pledging $35 million to help end hunger in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
With the support of the UK government, and donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn social injustice and malnutrition into footnotes in the history books said Tracey Ullman, the Power of Nutrition's ambassador to the masses, at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also claims that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and their children, the government has allocated funds for the Power of Nutrition project, which will improve the nutrition of 5 million women and children.
One of the most frequently asked questions on the Global Citizen website is: 'Why do they think that extreme poverty can be eradicated?'
Global Citizen's response: "It will be a long and difficult road, with some stumbling blocks and some failures.
But like the civil rights and anti-segregation movements before us, we'll get there because we're stronger together.
The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae will be performing at this year's New York event, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
Home Secretary: US would use naval blockade to impede Russian energy exports
"Washington could even use its navy to stop Russian energy carriers from entering the Middle East market if necessary", US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke told the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argues that Russia's active presence in Syria - especially as regards Russian operations carried out at the request of the legitimate Syrian government - is merely an excuse for Russia to secure new energy markets.
"I think they are only in the Middle East because they want to sell energy there, as they do in Eastern Europe and Southern Europe", Zinke said in a statement.
And the Minister of the Interior says there are ways to stop the Russians.
'The US Navy can ensure that sea lanes are open and can block them if necessary, thus ensuring that Russian energy does not enter the markets,' Zinke said.
Zinke addressed the audience at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that describes itself as the voice of energy consumers in the United States.
In his speech, he compared Washington's actions against Russia and Iran, noting that they were essentially the same methods.
"Iran and Russia can be sanctioned economically in much the same way: by using existing energy carriers as well as introducing new ones", Zinke said, while calling Russia a "one-dimensional economy", pointing to the country's dependence on fossil energy carriers.
The statements coincide with the Trump administration's plan to export liquefied natural gas to Europe, thereby crowding out Russia from the market, which offers a much cheaper option for European consumers.
So senior Trump administration officials, including the president himself, are persuading Germany to back out of the ill-fated pipeline project called Nord Stream 2, which, if realized, would make Germany a pawn of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, doubling existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin says Washington is opposing the project so vehemently for economic reasons, which is a manifestation of unfair competition.
I assume we are on the same page on the fact that energy should not be used for coercion and that consumers should be given the freedom to choose their suppliers said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The American attempt to persuade them backfired, as Germany reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the German Industry Association (BDI), has called on the US not to interfere in the EU's energy policy, as well as to stay away from bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I consider it a problem when a third country interferes in our energy affairs", said Dieter Kempf, president of the German Industrial Association (BDI) after the recent meeting between Angela Merkel and Vladimir Putin.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is seriously considering running for president in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that after the midterm elections, she's seriously considering running for president.
Warren in Massachusetts, at a town meeting in Holyoke, confirmed that he's considering running.
It's time for women to get into Washington and fix the broken government, and it's time for a woman to be president, too, Warren said, according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I'm seriously considering running for president.
At the town meeting, Warren criticized Donald Trump, saying he thought he was taking the country in a bad direction.
"I am watching with grave concern what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", Warren said.
Warren has been vocal in his criticism of Trump and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
But a poll released Thursday shows that a majority of Warren Massachusetts voters don't think Warren should run for president in 2020.
According to a poll by Suffolk University's Center for Political Analysis and the Boston Globe, 58% of Massachusetts voters who voted for Warren said he should not run for president until
Thirty-two percent of the voters support Warren for president.
The poll shows that the majority of respondents support the former governor's candidacy, 38%, and 48% oppose it.
The 2020 presidential election has brought up the names of high-ranking Democratic politicians, including former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden has until January to decide whether to run.
Sarah Palin Track Palin referred to PTSD at a rally for Donald Trump
26-year-old Track Palin served one year in Iraq after enlisting in September
He was arrested Monday night on a domestic-violence charge.
"What my son is going through, what he's been going through since he's been home, I understand the other families who are experiencing the horrors of PTSD and the wounds that our soldiers are coming home with", Sarah Palin told the audience at Donald Trump's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
He called Palin's son's arrest the elephant in the room, and said that his son, like all the other war veterans, had come back changed, hardened, and he was constantly concerned about whether he was paying proper respect to the service that his comrades, the pilots and all the other members of the military had done for the country.
Track Palin was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on a domestic violence charge against a woman, and Wasilla police spokesman Dan Bennett said that according to a report, Track Palin was armed and drunk when he committed the domestic violence.
18 member states and Washington D.C. support judicial review of asylum policy
18 states and Washington D.C. are also supporting a judicial review of a new U.S. refugee policy that denies asylum to those fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 different states and Washington, D.C., wrote a letter of support Friday in Washington to an asylum seeker who is suing the government, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sessions, a federal lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August, has not been released.
The plaintiff claims that she was assaulted by her partner and Khan's violent gang of thugs, but U.S. officials denied her asylum request on July 20.
She's being held in a Texas detention center.
Prosecutors in the states that support Grace have identified El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as places where many asylum claims to the United States originate, as these countries have ongoing problems with gang and domestic violence.
The new U.S. refugee policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals (BIA) that allowed undocumented immigrants to apply for asylum as refugees from domestic violence.
Karl Racine, the attorney general of Washington, D.C., said in a statement Friday that the new policy "overrides decades of state, federal and international law".
Federal law requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the facts and circumstances of the case, and such an impediment would violate this principle   says the expert letter.
The prosecutors also explained in the letter that the anti-immigration policy is hurting the U.S. economy because immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs and fill the lowest-level jobs.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June instructed asylum judges to deny asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang-related crimes.
"Asylum is for people who leave their country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on the grounds of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political belief", Sessions said in announcing the policy on June 11.
Asylum was not designed to solve all the problems that people around the world face every day, no matter how serious they are.
Desperate rescue in Palua, death toll doubled, rescue teams racing against time
The situation for the survivors is becoming more precarious.
"Everyone is very tense", says Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she soothes her fevered child in a disaster-stricken evacuation center in Palu.
The paramedics are bringing the bodies in every minute.
We barely have any water.
Some residents returned to their destroyed homes to salvage what was salvageable from the flooded property.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and hospitals, which were also damaged by the 7.5-magnitude quake, are unable to provide medical care.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, were taken to the Palyu Military Hospital, where they were treated outside the hospital building due to the strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he recalled how the fifth-floor hotel room he occupied with his wife and daughter was swept away by the devastating quake.
There was no time to escape.
I think I'm stuck in the walls of the collapsed building", Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to him and my daughter.
I hope they're safe.
US ambassador accuses China of plaguing the country with propaganda
The US ambassador to China accused Beijing of spreading propaganda in the US press, a week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a US daily newspaper that emphasized the mutual benefits of US-China trade relations.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday cited an ad in the China Daily Des Moines Register, Iowa's largest-circulation newspaper, accusing China of trying to interfere in the US congressional elections on November 6. China denies the accusation.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US election is a new stage in Washington's increasingly aggressive crackdown on China, according to US officials who spoke to Reuters.
While it is not unusual for foreign governments to promote trade with their countries through advertising, Beijing and Washington are engaged in an intensifying trade war, imposing new tariffs on each other's imports.
American and Chinese experts say that the Chinese retaliatory tariffs imposed at the beginning of the trade war were intended to target exporters in states where Trump and the Republican Party are popular, including Iowa.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa for multiple terms, said that Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses because Iowa exports a significant amount of its agricultural products to China.
Branstad wrote in an op-ed in the Des Moines Register on Sunday that "China is further harming our country by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press".
"The Chinese government is exploiting the cherished American tradition of freedom of speech and press by spreading propaganda in paid ads placed in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
 But if you go to a newsstand in Beijing, you will find very few critical articles, and the Chinese press is not accurately reflecting the different opinions of the Chinese people about the increasingly grim prospects of growth in the Chinese economy, because the media is under the strict control of the Chinese Communist Party.
Branstad added that one of China's most prestigious newspapers refused to pull its article, but the paper did not name it.
Analysts say Republicans may alienate female voters with the Kavanaugh scandal before the midterm elections.
Analysts say it could backfire as many high-ranking Republican politicians take on the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh amid sexual harassment allegations, potentially losing support among female voters in particular ahead of the midterm elections.
The case has stirred up heated emotions, and most Republicans have publicly stated that they will continue to vote for Kavanaugh.
These statements cannot be retracted, "says Grant Reeher, a political scientist at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, in a Saturday article in The Hill.
Reeher expressed doubts that the FBI investigation instigated at the last minute by Arizona Republican Senator Jeff Flake will be enough to calm the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, nor tomorrow, nor in November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, in a Washington, D.C.-based newspaper on Friday.
According to a report from the Mic, protesters in the Senate lobby on Friday morning chanted "November is coming!" as the Republican-controlled Justice Committee decided not to withdraw Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
"There will be a tremendous leap in democratic enthusiasm and motivation", Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
A lot of people say it's been high enough already, and it's true.
But it can be even higher, especially among suburban, insecure female voters and young people (18-29) who, while not enthusiastic about the president, often don't go to the polls.
Even before Ford's public testimony, analysts had speculated that he might strike back at Republicans if they continued to support Brett Kavanaugh's nomination, and since then, Ford has detailed in his testimony why he's accusing the Supreme Court nominee of sexual harassment.
"The Republican Party is in a bad way", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, on NBC News earlier this week.
"This is not just about the committee vote and the recall vote, or whether Kavanaugh gets appointed, but it's about how Republicans handled this and how they handled Ford", said Guy Cecil, director of Democratic Election Assistance for Priorities USA.
But it seems that Americans are pretty split on whether they believe Ford or Kavanaugh's testimony is true, with Kavanaugh having a little more faith than Ford.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41% of respondents either fully or somewhat trust Ford's testimony, and 35% of respondents for Kavanaugh gave the same answer.
Furthermore, 38% of respondents said Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied in his testimony, while only 30% of respondents believed Ford did.
Under Flake's direction, the FBI is currently investigating the veracity of Ford's claims, as well as those of another of Kavanaugh's accusers, Deborah Ramirez, according to the Guardian.
Ford testified under oath a week ago before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh had molested him drunk when he was 17.
Ramirez claims the Supreme Court nominee showed him his genitals at a party in the 1980s when they were both students at Yale.
The inventor of the world wide web would launch a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup with the goal of competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The tech legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company built on Berners-Lee's open-source platform, Solid.
With Solid, users can choose where they want to store their data and who can access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the purpose behind Inrupt was "to take over the world".
"We need to do it now", he said of the startup.
This is a historic moment.
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own personal online data store, also known as POD.
This may include lists, to-do lists, calendars, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like having Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all from the same browser at the same time.
What's unique about the online personal data store is that it's entirely up to the user to decide who has access to their data.
The company calls this the realization of the right of individuals to self-determination over data.
John Bruce, CEO of Inrupt, says that the company's mission is to provide the resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company is currently made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, a few contracted developers who are working on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using tools available on Inrupt.
Berners-Lee says he and his team are not asking Facebook and Google to introduce a technology that will bring about a complete change that will turn their business models upside down overnight.
We don't ask for their permission.
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the newly built Solidra network.
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the face of the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at MIT.
In recent months, Mr Berners-Lee has been a key voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute despite launching Inrupt.
"I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the web", added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann, Victorian Crusader, minister in World War I, was celebrated
The only Anglican minister to receive the Victoria Cross is celebrating 100 years since his heroic actions in the First World War.
The Honorable Bernard Vann, Lieutenant Colonel, was awarded the medal for his actions during the attack on Bellenenglise and LeCourt on September 29, 1918.
But four days later, a sniper killed him, and he never learned that he had earned the highest decoration in the British armed forces.
A memorial stone in his honour was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a ceremony in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was symbolic that the memorial was dedicated exactly 100 years after his grandfather's heroic deed.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, the Hon. Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin amidst a thick fog and fierce artillery and machine gun fire.
Later, he rushed to the front line and, with extraordinary heroism, led the battalion, then single-handedly stormed a field artillery detachment, taking out three of its members.
Bernard Vann, Honorable and Lieutenant Colonel, was shot down by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just one month before the end of the war.
"I know I can never match what my grandfather accomplished, and it taught me humility", said 72-year-old Michael Vann of his grandfather.
After a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, Michael Vann and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also unveiled the memorial stone.
Michael Vann said he was honoured to play a part in the ceremony, and added: "The true heroism of a hero is shown by the number of people who pay their respects to him later".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 broadcast, and instead they got Peppa Pig.
Imagine staying up all night to watch the thrilling Bellator 206, and then the broadcast goes off.
The San José show featured 13 fights, six of which were broadcast live at night as part of the main competition series on Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight each other, the surprise of the British audience was that Peppa Pig was on the show instead of the match.
This was aggravated by many who were kept up until the early hours of the morning by this very clash.
A cartoon of a kid being shown instead of an MMA match was called a "sick joke" by a fan on Twitter.
"The channel is no longer allowed to broadcast this type of content at 6am under government regulations, so they had to switch to children's programmes", said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of communications and marketing at Bellator, in a statement on the programme.
Yes, it's Peppa, the pig's time.
Scott Coker, president of Bellator Corporation, has promised that in the future, the show's schedule will be revised to accommodate viewers in the United Kingdom.
"I think we can definitely solve the problem with repetition", Coker said.
 However, since it is 6:00 a.m. Sunday morning there, we cannot correct the situation until Sunday morning, which is Monday in our time zone.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the show was on, there were a lot of messages, and most of them weren't very friendly.
At first, we thought it was a technical problem, so we tried to fix it.
But it wasn't that. We ran into some legal trouble.
But I can promise you that next time, it won't happen.
We've reduced the number of matches from six to five. We wanted to please the audience, but we've had to do it.
It was an unfortunate situation.
Tom Daley struggled with a minority complex because of his sexual orientation.
Olympic figure skater Tom Daley said that when he was young, he felt inferior to everyone because of his sexual orientation, but that's what motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete says that it wasn't until high school that he realized that not everyone is as smart as he is.
On Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, he told host Lauren Laverne that he was standing up for gay rights to give hope to others.
He added that since he became a father, he's been much less interested in the Olympics.
The longtime host of the show, Kirsty Young, has been absent for several months due to illness.
On the first Laverne show, Daley invited me to be a castaway, and he said that as a young man he felt inferior to everyone else because it was socially unacceptable for someone to love both boys and girls.
She said: "To this day, my sense of inferiority and otherness is what gives me the stamina and strength to achieve my successes".
He wanted to prove that he was worth something so that he wouldn't disappoint everyone when his sexual orientation came out.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a public figure in the LGBTI community, and has used her appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to urge governments around the world to decriminalize homosexuality in as many countries as possible.
He said he took the case because he felt lucky to be able to live his life openly without negative consequences and he wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that he was "completely surprised" by the situation when he fell in love with another man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he first met in 2013.
Daley and the Oscar-winning screenwriter who is 20 years her senior got married last year, and she claims that the age difference has never been a problem between them.
"If you go through so much at such a young age", he said, "you're in your first Olympics at 14 and your father died of cancer three years later", he said, "it's hard to find someone in your age group who has gone through such extreme experiences".
The couple adopted a boy in June, named Robert Ray Black-Daley, who, by Daley's own admission, had completely changed his view of the world.
"If you'd asked me that question last year, I would have said the most important thing is to win the gold medal", he said.
But you know what I've realized, there are more important things than my Olympic gold medal.
My gold medal from the Olympics, Robbie.
The child was named after Daley's father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
According to Daley, his father was unwilling to accept that he was going to die, and one of his last questions was whether tickets for the 2012 London Olympics were available, as he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'Dad, you're not going to be there in the front row.'"
I held his hand when he stopped breathing, but until that moment, I couldn't accept that my father wasn't invulnerable.
The next year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I felt that this was what I had dreamed of all my life, to be able to jump in front of a home crowd at the Olympic Games, and there is no feeling like this", she said.
It was also the inspiration for her first song, Heather Small Proud, which helped her through her Olympic preparation, and still makes her feel like a little bitch when she hears it.
The Desert Island Discs are on Sunday at 11:15 local time on BBC Radio 4.
Mickelson was out of shape and was sidelined Saturday at the Ryder Cup.
Phil Mickelson of the United States could set a record by playing in his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he'll have to regain his form if he doesn't want this milestone to be remembered as an unpleasant experience.
Mickelson is playing in a record 12th appearance at the biennial event, but his performance in Saturday's four-ball and four-man games has been blamed by team captain Jim Furyk for his suspension.
Instead of being the player who won five major tournaments and was the center of attention, as he was so often when the United States was fighting for victory, he now spends half the day cheering for his team and the other half practicing on the court and trying to correct the mistakes that were making his game weaker.
At the peak of his career, he was never one of the most accurate hitters, so the 48-year-old is not really suited to the narrow course of Le Golf National, where the high grass makes it very expensive to make a wrong hit.
And if the court itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson will face the ninth-round match Sunday against the accurate Francesco Molinari, the English champion, who has won all four of his matches this week with rookie Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who are four points behind in the first 12 games, start strong, then Mickelson's match could be decisive.
Furyk says he trusts the player, but what else can he say?
"He is fully aware of the role he has played in shaping today, patting me on the back, and giving me a hug and promising to be ready for tomorrow", Fury said.
 Extremely confident.
He's one of the greatest, and he's done a lot for the team in the past and in the past week.
I didn't give him two games, basically.
I had more planned, but in the circumstances, we decided it was the best thing to do.
He wants to be on the court like everybody else.
With Mickelson's performance on Sunday, he's going to break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games ever played.
That would mark the end of a Ryder Cup run that was far from the player's individual best.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk stressed that the veteran's presence has brought tangible benefits to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to joke with others, great team member", he explained.
I think the younger players enjoyed the games against him, and that's good to see.
His presence is beyond the strict sense of the game.
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, is aware that they could easily lose their advantage
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that even if you get a significant lead into the final day of the Ryder Cup, where the individual matches are held, you can easily be turned around.
The Danish player made his debut in a 1997 match in Valderrama, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros took a five-point lead over the Americans, and then barely managed to hold on to a hair-raising lead to win the match by 141⁄2131⁄2 .
"We always have to remind ourselves that we had a big advantage in Valderrama, but we won by a hair's breadth, and we had a big advantage in Brookline, where we were eventually knocked out", said Bjørn, pictured here after the 2018 class 5-3 win on Friday and yesterday, leading them to 10-6 at Le National Golf.
Just think of the tournaments of the past few years, and you can see that the game is not over.
Tomorrow you'll have to play with full force.
So go out there and do whatever it takes to win.
We can't relax until the scores are on the board.
We have a goal, which is to win this trophy, and that's all we have to focus on right now.
As I said before, I'm mostly dealing with our team of 12 players, but we also have to look at the other side, who happen to be some of the greatest players in the world.
Bjørn, proud of the team's performance on a difficult track, added: 'I would never make predictions in this situation.
Tomorrow is a whole different ball game.
Then it's all about individual performance, which is completely different from team play.
It's great to play in pairs when things are going well, but when you're on your own, it's all about the player you are.
That's what you have to teach the players to do to bring out the best in them on the court tomorrow.
They'll have to break up with their partner, who will also have to be in top form.
Unlike Bjorn, the opposing team's captain, Jim Furyk, is explicitly confident that his players will perform better as individuals than as a pair, except for the pair of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four.
Fury has personally experienced both sides of the last-day resurrections, being part of the winning team in Brooklyn and then on the losing side after the European team's spectacular performance at the "Miracle of Medina".
"I remember all the damn words", he replied when asked what he was doing encouraging the players before the final day of Ben Crenshaw's captaincy in 1999.
We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we're going to have a fast start, like we had in Brookline, like we had in Medinah.
If one team really gets involved, it puts a lot of pressure on the other team's players in the middle of the game.
We have arranged the lineup accordingly and prepared our players to perform a real miracle tomorrow.
Thomas has been tasked with leading the charge to turn the tide, and will play against Rory McIlroy in the first match, followed by Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the top half of the European team.
I decided to go with the order because I think it's the way it's put together from start to finish.
Once again, the delivery of Germany's newest warship has been postponed.
The German Navy's newest frigate was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace aging Cold War warships, but due to various system failures and exponentially rising costs, it's not due until at least next year.
The commissioning of the flagship of the brand new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, the Rheinland-Pfalz, has been postponed to the first half of 2019, writes the weekly Die Zeit, citing a spokesman for the army.
The ship was originally scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but the continuing delays have complicated the fate of the large-scale project.
The Navy ordered the four Baden-Württemberg-class ships in 2007 to replace the aging Bréma-class frigates.
We know it will be armed with a high-fire cannon and various anti-aircraft and anti-submarine missiles and cloaking technology, including a silencer that will reduce ship radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Another important feature is that they require less maintenance, which in practice means that these new frigates can be put into service for up to two years away from the mother ships.
However, due to the continued delay of the project, these high-tech warships, with which Germany could project its power overseas, may become obsolete by the time they are finally put into service, notes Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had sent a delivered ship back to the manufacturer.
Little information has emerged about the reasons for the return, but German media have reported several critical software and hardware failures that render the warship unusable for a combat mission.
The software deficiencies are a major problem, as the Baden-Württemberg class will only have 120 sailors, half the crew of the old Bréma class frigates.
It was also revealed that the ship was extremely overweight, which would impair its performance and make it impossible for the Navy to make any further modifications.
The 7,000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate is said to be twice as heavy as similar ships commissioned by the Germans in World War II.
Aside from the faulty parts, the increase in the overall cost of the project, including the training of the crew, is a growing problem.
According to some sources, the project has already cost a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion), compared with the initial estimate of 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of the new frigates are of particular importance in the light of the warnings that Germany's naval presence is in decline.
Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament's national defense committee, recently acknowledged that the navy is running out of warships in working order.
According to the civil servant, the problem has become self-reinforcing, as the old ships had to be decommissioned, but there are no more ships to replace the ones that have been lost.
He expressed concern that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates had been able to join the navy.
The National Trust is investigating the secret lives of the bats.
A new study is being carried out on a farm in the Scottish Highlands to find out how bats exploit the landscape while hunting.
The researchers hope that their findings will provide new information on the behavior of the unique flying mammals that could benefit future conservation efforts.
Scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will be studying the behaviour of common and soprano storks, brown long-eared bats and water bats in the Inverewe Garden area in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices are placed at appropriate points in the area to record bat activities during the season.
And NHS staff and volunteers will be using handheld detectors to collect mobile data.
By analyzing the detailed audio of the recordings, we can determine the frequency of the bat sounds and what the species is doing.
Researchers also produce habitat maps and reports that detail how animal behaviour is shaped by the landscape.
Rob Dewar, conservation adviser for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal the most important habitats for bats and how each species uses them.
This information helps to determine the beneficial effects of habitat management measures such as afforestation and how best to conserve wooded areas for bats and other affected species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, the size of bat populations has declined significantly over the last century.
Construction and land development disrupt the animals' sleeping quarters and shorten their life spans.
Wind turbines and street lighting are also a risk factor, as are the use of flypaper, certain chemical processes used in building materials, and attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not actually totally blind.
However, because of their nocturnal nature, they rely more on their hearing than on their eyesight when hunting prey.
Their sophisticated technique of ultrasound reflection enables them to determine the precise position of insects and other objects in their path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens, and 76,000 acres of land throughout the country, takes the bat issue very seriously.
They are staffed by ten trained specialists who regularly carry out studies and bed-testing and occasionally participate in rescue operations.
The organisation has created Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve on the Threave peninsula in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The area is ideal for bats, according to estate manager David Thompson.
"There's a great place for bats here in Threave", he said.
 There are old buildings, lots of old trees, and everything else that is necessary for a good living space.
But there's a lot we don't know about bats, and thanks to the work we've done here and in other similar areas, we're able to learn a lot more about what they need to do to feel great.
He also stressed the importance of making sure that buildings are protected from bats before they are renovated, since the destruction of a single settlement could result in the death of 400 females and young, which could lead to the extinction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected animals, and killing, harassing, and polluting them is against the law.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, has also appealed to the public for help.
He stated: 'There is still much we don't know about bats, and we have almost no information about the status of most of the native species.'
Ronaldo denies rape allegations, his lawyers file suit against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the allegations of rape against him "fake news", saying he believes others are using his name to "cover up the public's attention".
The footballer's lawyers are ready to sue the German tabloid Der Spiegel, who dropped the charges.
The Portuguese midfielder and Juventus star was accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
The woman claims the athlete paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the case, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Hours after the allegations came to light, 33-year-old Ronaldo told his 142 million Instagram Live followers that the news was a lie.
No, no, no, no and no.
Everything they've said about me today is a lie, told to the camera by the five-time Ballon d'Or winner.
They want to use my name to get into the public consciousness.
It happens.
They want my name to be famous, that's the life of a public figure.
I'm a happy man and my life is fine. " The player added with a smile.
In response to the allegations, which have been described as "unacceptable" and "suspicious of privacy", Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel, reports Reuters.
According to lawyer Christian Schertz, the player will be seeking compensation for the moral damage caused by the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years.
The incident allegedly took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the athlete's apartment where the man raped her anal, according to a filing with the Clark County District Attorney's office in Nevada.
According to Mayorga, Ronaldo got down on one knee after the incident and told him that he was a good boy, 99 percent, except for the one percent that was not.
Based on the information in the documents, Ronaldo admitted to having a sexual relationship with the woman, but he said it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had a visit to a hospital for her injuries, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she feared retaliation and public humiliation.
The 34-year-old now wants to rescind the agreement, as the trauma of the incident continues to haunt her.
Ronaldo was on the verge of a transfer from Real Madrid to Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and was bought by Italian giants Juve for €100 million this summer.
Brexit: the UK will mourn the loss of its car industry forever
The UK will "always regret" losing its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added: 'I am concerned by Toyota UK's statement to the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the carmaker will be forced to temporarily halt production at its factory in Burnaby, near Derby.
"We need to reach an agreement", Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer believes that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, delays at the border could lead to job losses.
The Burna-Stadt plant, which makes the Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I see that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be production stoppages at the factory", said Marvin Cooke, managing director of Toyota in Burnaby.
Other car manufacturers in the UK (including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover) have also expressed concern about the possibility of the UK leaving the EU without an agreement on the operation of cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, has announced that it will close its Oxford factory for the Mini for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers is the risk of a no-deal Brexit in the supply chain.
The Toyota production line is running on a very timely basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers operating in the UK and other EU Member States.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, the disruption at the border could lead to production delays and shortages of parts, according to industry representatives.
Toyota said that its plant in Derbyshire would be unable to store more than a day's worth of spare parts and would have to stop production.
Clark said that Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU, known as Chequers, is 'precisely set up to avoid delays at the border'.
"We need a deal, a deal on the best possible terms, one that not only brings the fruits of our current success, but also offers new opportunities", he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
 Not only Toyota, but other manufacturers can confirm that we definitely need to maintain our highly successful supply chain.
Toyota could not say how long the production would be stopped, but warned that the accumulated costs could damage the competitiveness of the factory in the long run, which could eventually lead to job losses.
According to Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked for 24 years at the factory in Burnaby and is now represented by Unite, union members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, jobs that are eliminated at this stage will never be returned".
A government spokesman said: 'We have developed a precise and workable plan for future EU relations.'
Trump and Rosenstein's meeting may be postponed again, the White House says.
The high-stakes meeting between Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Donald Trump may be postponed for another week as the debate over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said in a statement Sunday.
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election meddling, possible ties between Trump advisers and the Russian government, and possible obstruction of justice by Trump.
In Washington, there's been speculation for months about whether Trump would eventually fire the deputy attorney general, thereby jeopardizing Mueller's independence.
A New York Times report this month said Rosenstein was considering wiretapping the meeting to record the conversation with the president, and raised questions about whether the 25th Amendment would allow Trump to be removed from office.
Rosenstein denied what he said.
But last Monday, he visited the White House and there were rumors that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then appearing before the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he was not willing to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid clashing with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, where Kavanaugh and one of the women accusing him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, also testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, further delaying the decisive Senate vote.
Trump press secretary Sarah Sanders was a guest on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he gave the following answer: We don't have a date yet, we can set it this week, but in light of the Supreme Court cases, I see a chance of another one-week delay.
It's about to get out, and I'm gonna go to the press, as usual.
Some reporters were skeptical, however, as Sanders had not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Chris Wallace, the host, asked me about the reason for this.
Sanders responded that the rarity of press conferences was not due to his disgust with the sensationalistic behavior of television reporters, but added: "I do not dispute the fact that they are sensationalistic".
He then hinted that more face-to-face meetings between Trump and members of the press would be held.
"The president is giving more Q&A interviews than any president before him". "We've looked at the numbers", he added, without substantiating the claim.
Press briefings will continue, Sanders said, but if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, it's better to talk to light years than to talk to me.
We often try to do this, and there have been many such occasions in the last few weeks, so instead of the White House press conference, you can speak to the President of the United States in person.
Trump regularly answers reporters' questions when he leaves the White House or attends public events or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
But press conferences held alone are rare.
Why, one might infer from what happened this week when the president in New York City produced an unorthodox and at times bizarre performance before a gathering of journalists.
The head of the health service wrote to NHS Scotland's EU staff about Brexit concerns
The head of the health service wrote to express the country's gratitude for the staff of Scotland's NHS from the European Union and highlighted the hope that they would remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter less than six months before the United Kingdom's expected departure.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to cover the costs of residence applications by EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Mr Freeman wrote: The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on withdrawal continued during the summer, leading to a decision expected in the autumn.
The UK Government has also undertaken to prepare a possible no-deal scenario.
I'm aware of how unsettling this period can be for you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the efforts of each and every member of the team, regardless of their country of origin.
Staff from different EU Member States and other countries bring valuable experience and expertise to the work of the health service, which also has a positive impact on patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home, and we would love to have you stay with us.
Christion Abercrombie had to undergo emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christie Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, reports Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
He was walking to the shoreline and he just collapsed. Reed said.
The coaching staff and the medical staff first gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines, then put him on a gurney and took him to further evaluation.
An official from Tennessee State in Nashville, Tennessee, told WSMV reporter Chris Harris that Abercrombie is out of surgery, which was performed at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that he has no further details on the type and extent of the injury at this time, while Tennessee State is working to determine exactly when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore who's been out for a year, is in his first season at Tennessee State, where he transferred from Illinois.
He had five successful outfits on Saturday before he left the track, bringing his total to 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher taxes on UK property
Under the new Tory plan, foreign buyers will have to pay higher rates for property purchased in the UK, with the extra income generated by this to support the homeless.
By doing so, I would be negating Corbyn's success among young voters.
Increase in the fee for those who are not taxed in the UK
The Treasury estimates that this would generate £120 million a year in revenue to support the homeless.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher taxes on UK property purchases, and the extra revenue will be used to support the homeless, Theresa May is set to announce at a press conference today.
The move is likely to offset Jeremy Corbyn's success among young voters, which he achieved with his promise of more affordable housing and measures targeting the high-income earners.
The increase in the levy will affect individuals and companies that do not pay tax in the UK, and the extra revenue from this will be used to fight homelessness.
The surcharge on the current levy, which is calculated over and above the higher levy on second homes and property purchased for expenditure purposes two years ago, can be as high as 3%.
The Treasury expects to receive £120 million a year from the measure.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built London properties are bought by non-UK nationals, causing a significant price increase which makes the situation of first home buyers increasingly difficult.
Many of the country's affluent neighborhoods have become ghost towns, especially in the capital, where many foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the country.
The new bill comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in benefits to help young people waiting for their first homes.
He personally blames the big construction companies for keeping property prices high, who have become accustomed to buying up and leaving lots vacant, and has asked May to remove the affordable housing quotas and address the country's housing market embarrassment.
Corbyn has announced a series of notable proposals for housing reforms, including rent controls and the abolition of unjustified evictions.
It would also give the councils more power and opportunity to build new houses.
May said: "Last year I said I wanted to dedicate my premiership to restoring the English dream and to making life better for each generation.
And to do that, we need to fix the housing market.
Britain remains, as it always has been, open to those who wish to live, work and raise a family here.
But it is not right that individuals living outside the country and companies with foreign interests should be able to buy property as easily as hardworking British citizens.
The dream of owning a home has become almost unattainable for too many, and the plight of homelessness has become too accessible.
Jack Ross: My greatest wish is to be the manager of the Scottish team 
Jack Ross, the manager of Sunderland, has said that his greatest ambition is to manage the Scottish national team one day.
The 42-year-old Scottish coach is keen to take on the challenge of resurrecting the North-East club, who currently sit in third place in the premier league, just three points behind the first-place finishers.
He then moved his headquarters to the newly renamed Stadium of Light after successfully returning St Mirren to the Scottish First Division Championship the previous season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
"I'm not sure I'm going to be able to make it", said Ross on BBC Sportsound.
When I was a kid, I used to watch a lot of Scottish football in Hampden with my dad, and something always drew me back to them.
Now, however, I have no chance of succeeding as a club manager.
In his previous spells as manager of Sunderland, Ross has had the likes of Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic is not worried about following in the footsteps of such big names, and has previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
I'm measuring success right now by whether I can get this team back to first class.
If we take the structure and facilities of the club, there is no doubt that it belongs in the first division.
It won't be easy to get back, but I'll probably only be successful if I can get the club back.
Ross's managerial career began just three years ago after a stint as assistant coach at Dumbarton and 15 months on the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Aola to get back on its feet after the team fell back to the third division, and with St Mirren on the verge of relegation, he won the championship the following season.
Ross claims he feels more confident now than he ever did in his playing career, whether at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren or Hamilton Academical.
It was a defining moment, he recalled, when he was coach of Alloa.
I clearly thought that being a manager was more for me than being a player.
That sounds weird, because I did well, I did a pretty good job, and I had some really memorable moments.
But sometimes life for a player is very hard.
There's a lot of stuff to go through every single week.
Of course, I still have to deal with the stress and pressure of the job, but the management responsibilities are a strain.
I've always been interested in management, and now that I've had a taste of it, I feel like I'm in the best shape of my adult life.

A study shows that the best beer is drunk at 5:30 on Saturday afternoon
The summer heat wave has seen a significant increase in the number of struggling pubs in England, but restaurant chains are still under pressure.
According to the data collected, the revenue of pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, while that of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, of the CGA business consultancy, which compiles the statistics, said: The sunshine and England's longer than expected World Cup run continued the trend of the previous month in July, when pubs saw a 2.8% increase in revenue, with an even bigger decline in restaurants.
The decline in restaurant revenues, which was 1.8% in June, worsened in July.
The best performers were pubs and bars, which mainly sold alcohol, and which generated a higher rate of growth than the loss of jobs in restaurants.
Pubs that serve more food are also affected by the prolonged sunshine, although not nearly as dramatically as restaurant operators.
People seem to be more into drinking at this time of year.
The revenue from drinks in the pubs and bars operated by the companies increased by 6.6% this month, while the revenue from food fell by 3%.
According to Paul Newman, a RSM analyst in the leisure and hospitality industry: These results follow a trend that has been emerging since the end of April.
The weather and major social and sporting events continue to be the main revenue drivers for the entertainment and hospitality industry.
Not surprisingly, restaurant chains are in a difficult situation, and the 4.8% annual revenue drop could be especially painful due to the ongoing cost pressures.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for restaurant operators, and only time will tell whether the milder weather experienced in August will bring relief in this area.
Total revenue growth for pubs and restaurants, including newly opened places, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowing pace of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, which tracks sales in the UK's hospitality sector (pubs, bars and restaurants) and is a widely accepted industry benchmark, collects and analyses performance data from a group of operators with a total turnover of over £9 billion and 47 weeks.
One in five children has social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One survey found that one in five children (as young as 11) have social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students found that Instagram is growing
News of the spread of sexual content increases fear of sharing
20% of pupils said they had a primary account that their parents could see
One in five children (as young as 11 years old) have a social media account that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found that the number of "Insta" accounts, which refers to the photo-sharing site Instagram, is growing rapidly.
The news has raised fears about sharing sexual content.
20% of the students said that they have a clean main account that their parents can see, but they also create private accounts.
A mother who accidentally stumbled upon her 13-year-old daughter's secret Web site found a profile of a teenager who said to "rape me".
According to research by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) representing headmasters and headmistresses of independent schools, 40% of 11-18 year olds have two profiles and 50% admit to having private accounts.
"I find it disturbing that so many teenagers feel they need to create an online space where parents and teachers can't reach them", said HMC Director Mike Buchanan.
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of athletes in the Scottish Athletic Association.
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive director of the Scottish Athletic Association at the annual meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful athlete and the board's chairman, Ian Beattie, says that the athlete's vast international experience over the past decade will be of invaluable help to sporting decision-makers.
"Eilidh is held in great esteem in Scotland, the UK and the international athletic community, and her presence will help the development of Scottish athletics", said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I'm delighted to be the voice of the athletes and I hope I can really help the work of the Scottish sports directors".
The American athlete, who regularly appears as an expert on the BBC, won two of his four Olympic gold medals in the 200- and 400-meter events at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, but a transient cerebral hemorrhage has forced him to use a wheelchair.
He tweeted:  A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that in time, I'd be able to tell if I was going to recover at all.
It's been a lot of work, but I've made a full recovery, I can walk again, and I'm going to go to agility class today!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!
A breast-heart ad comparing mothers to cows shares the online community
A breast-feeding company's advertisement comparing nursing mothers to head cows has sparked controversy online.
Elvie claims to have developed the world's first silent, wearable breast pump, and its launch was heralded in an ironic advert that quoted music videos that showed the freedom the device would give mothers who were weaning.
Four real moms dance in a barn full of straw, while the lyrics of the song are heard in the background, which include the lines: "Yes, I'm getting ready to shave, I don't even have a tail yet", and "If I hadn't noticed, these are not boobs, but my breasts".
And the chorus goes, "I'm gonna pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, and pump, and then you know, you know, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump,
The ad posted on the company's Facebook page quickly became the center of online debate.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times and received hundreds of comments indicating a mixed reception, with many saying the commercial mocks the dairy industry's "horrors".
Promoting the product with very tasteless cows.
Like us, their bodies produce milk only when they give birth to offspring, but their calves are taken from them within days, "reminds one of the speakers.
The Elvie breast pump can be discreetly placed in a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: "Yes, it's terrible for the mother and the calf.
But why not use them to sell pacifiers to mothers who can keep their babies?
Someone else added: "A totally senseless ad".
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she thought the video was "relatively funny".
I think it's a genius idea.
I would have bought it right away if I was still breastfeeding.
I felt like a cow myself.
It's a silly commercial, so I'm not even trying to see it anymore.
The product is brilliant.
Another commenter said: "It's a funny ad for mothers who are breastfeeding at work or in a toilet and feel like cows".
It's not the dairy industry that's praised or condemned.
At the end of the video, the women show that they had the discreet breast pump in their bras all the time while they were dancing.
The campaign is building on the notion that women who use a breast pump sometimes feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump, on the other hand, is silent, uses no wires or tubes, and can be discreetly placed in a breast-feeding bra, allowing women to move freely, hold their baby, or even move out while sucking.
Ana Balarin, co-owner and communications director of Mother, said: "The Elvie Pump is a revolutionary product, so it had to be advertised in a bold, provocative way.
By pointing to the parallel between women milking their milk and milking cows, we wanted to highlight the challenges of using a suction cup and to make a humorous observation of the freedom our suction cups provide in comparison.
Elvie's nipple isn't the first to be in the news.
At London Divathete, a mother of two stepped on the runway in Marta Jakubowski's clothes while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been secretly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of immigrants with children in custody reached a record high, while the monthly number of border crossings remained largely unchanged, in part because of the Trump administration's harsh rhetoric and policies that have made it harder to find homes for them.
The host families are typically illegal immigrants themselves, and they fear that applying to take in the children will jeopardize their chances of staying in the country.
This threat was further escalated in June when it was announced that adoptive parents and adults living with them in a household would be required to provide fingerprints and share this data with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, the chief immigration and customs enforcement official, admitted in testimony to Congress last week that dozens of people were arrested for applying to receive unaccompanied minors.
The bureau later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had criminal records.
80% of applicants and their households are in the country illegally and a significant proportion are convicted criminals.
"We will therefore continue to search for such individuals", said Albence.
To speed up the process for children, new rules have been introduced that require some of them to appear in court within one month of being taken into custody, instead of the current 60 days, social workers say.
Many people report to the court via videoconferencing rather than appear in person to apply for residence permits.
If the judge doesn't grant legal protection, the immigrant is deported quickly.
In recent months, social workers and other workers in the system have reported that the longer the detention, the more anxious and depressed the children become, and the more likely they are to engage in violent outbursts or escape attempts.
Human rights activists say that these risks are exacerbated by the fact that a large facility like the one in Tornillo, with a large number of children, makes it difficult to screen out those who need psychological care.
They added that not giving the children enough time to prepare or to say goodbye to their friends before they are moved to such a facility would leave them in even greater distress.
Syria has called for the immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish forces.
Speaking before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem urged Syrian refugees to return to their homes despite the country's eight-year civil war.
Moualem, who also holds the position of Deputy Prime Minister, claimed that foreign forces had illegally entered Syrian territory in the name of fighting terrorism and would be dealt with accordingly.
They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally, he told the Assembly.
Moualem argued that the war on terror in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have been forced to flee their homes, was coming to an end.
He declared that Damascus was waging a holy war to clear all of Syria of terrorist groups and illegal foreign presence.
There are 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria, most of them trainers and advisers helping Kurdish forces and Arab militias fighting against Bashar al-Assad.
France has sent over 1,000 troops to the war-torn country.
With regard to refugees, Moualem claimed that the conditions were right for their return and that only a few Western countries were stirring up irrational fears and discouraging refugees from returning.
We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help the population return home.
 They made politics out of a purely humanitarian issue. 
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide reconstruction assistance to Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and his opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone around the last major rebel stronghold, Idlib, could help further negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented Russian-backed Syrian government forces from launching a full-scale offensive against the three-million-strong province.
However, Mr Moualem stressed that the agreement sets clear deadlines and expressed his hope that military action would be directed only against jihadists, including the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, which should be eradicated.
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that a committee of government and opposition delegates will soon be convened to draft a post-war constitution and prepare for elections.
The Syrian government's participation in the committee was subject to conditions, such as that only the revision of certain articles of the current constitution was acceptable, and that all external actors were to be warned against interfering in the process.
That's why they're going to re-elect Trump.
Following this logic, Trump will surely be re-elected in 2020, unless the hopes of many liberal viewers are dashed and a impeachment trial or a scandal prematurely ends his presidency.
We can be sure that this will be the most dramatic presidential final of all time.
For now, however, the audience is enjoying the show.
Since 2014, CNN's prime-time viewership has nearly doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC's viewership has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen data, Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers during its prime time hours, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC is the most-watched cable program with 3.5 million viewers reaching the evening news broadcast.
"We're drawn to it like fire because it's something we don't understand", said Neal Baer, executive producer of ABC's "A Designated Survivor", a drama series in which a low-level cabinet minister sits in the president's chair after the Capitol is destroyed in an attack.
Veteran comedy writer Nell Scovell, author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club", has a different take.
He recalls a Boston taxi route before the 2016 election:
The driver told me he's going to vote for Trump.
Why? Scovell asked him.
"Because you're laughing", the driver replied.
That's the fun of chaos.
Of course, unlike the TV series, the stories coming out of Washington can determine the fate of cases like Roe vs. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited, and the stability of the global economy.
Only a very small number of people can ignore these facts.
But it's no longer a responsible piece of information, when you've been staring at a six-hour news broadcast about the authenticity of the anonymous background chatter used by Bob Woodward in his book "The Believer", or about Paul Manafort's $15,000 leather ostrich jacket, or about the consequences of Stormy Daniels's description of Trump's anatomy.
As far as I'm concerned, from now on, this is what I'll always remember about Super Mario.
"It's a bit like watching a reality show where you get something new every night", says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Stars".
If you miss one part, you're immediately out of the game.
When I arrived at Fleiss this week, it was a pleasant, sunny, 78-degree day on Kaua'i, and he was sitting inside his house watching MSNBC, while recording the CNN show.
He couldn't stay away from television as Brett Kavanaugh's hearing began in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, where the future of the Supreme Court itself was at stake.
I remember when we did those crazy shows, a lot of people said it was the beginning of the end for Western civilization.
I thought they were joking, but it turns out they were right.

Both parties are pouring money into the tightest race in the midterm congressional elections.
It's no surprise that in Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District, both parties are spending money out of pocket after redistricting the congressional districts, with two incumbents vying for the same seat.
One of the contenders for the newly redrawn Pittsburgh suburb is Democrat Conor Lamb, who won a seat in a midterm election last spring.
Lamb's opponent, Republican Keith Rothfus, currently represents Pennsylvania's former 12th congressional district, which overlaps significantly with the current 17th.
The map had to be redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the previous bypass was manipulated to benefit Republicans.
In the race for the 17th District, the two party funding bodies, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC), almost bid against each other during the campaign.
Lamb's name became well known in Pennsylvania after he narrowly won the highly-watched March midterm election in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The House seat has been held by Republicans for over a decade, with Donald Trump winning the district by 20 points.
Political experts say the Democrats have a slightly better chance of winning.
The United States considered sanctions against El Salvador for supporting China, then backed off.
Diplomatic sources say the Dominican Republic and Panama have already sided with Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Donald Trump had a good-humored meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners forced the Trump Organization's management team out.
The State Department has recalled top officials from U.S. missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over their recent decision not to support Taiwan, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier.
However, sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which in 2017 received approximately $140 million in U.S. aid, including counter-narcotics, development and economic support.
The proposed punitive measures, such as reducing financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have painfully affected the Central American country, which also has extremely high unemployment and murder rates.
As the closed-door meetings continued, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference on security and economic issues, which was supposed to be a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, and whose primary goal was to reduce immigration to the United States.
In mid-September, high-level representatives of the administration made it clear that they wanted to hold the conference, which clearly indicated that they did not intend to punish El Salvador.
It was announced that Vice President Mike Pence would speak at the mid-October conference, which diplomats said was a clear indication of the importance the administration is attaching to the event.
The three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no condemnation from Washington or criminal action being taken.
White House spokesman John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the dispute, which was reported anonymously by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats.
Their reports were corroborated by outside analysts close to the administration, who also spoke on the record.
Historical experience
The next blow could come from the special counsel Robert Mueller's report, which is investigating whether Trump has obstructed justice in any way... and there are a number of facts that have been made public that suggest that he has.
Mueller's investigation is also reportedly looking into whether Trump's team cooperated with Russia in its efforts to influence the election.
If the Democrats win control of Congress, they will surely try to hold Trump accountable, who, after the voters, may have to face the judgment of his fellow politicians.
We can see that there are many uncertainties, and Trump's defeat is far from inevitable... as are his European allies.
Weighing decisions are needed on both sides of the Atlantic, and how long the fight will last depends on them.
In 1938, a number of German officers were ready to beat Hitler, only to see the West side with the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
The lack of support did not prevent the bloodshed of the following years.
It is at such historical turning points that the inevitable development of democracy accelerates or slows.
In today's America, we can identify a number of such turning points.
What are we going to do if Trump removes the deputy attorney general who oversaw the Mueller investigation, Rod Rosenstein?
Rosenstein's chair has been vacant since last year, when, as our newspaper reported, he suggested that the president's conversations be recorded and suggested that Trump was unfit to hold office.
Rosenstein says The Times has been inaccurate in its reporting of the events.
How will we respond if the FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh turns biased or incomplete, and he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite a credible allegation of sexual harassment?
And the most important question: In the midterm elections, will we vote for a Congress that is prepared to hold Trump accountable?
If we fail in these trials, democracy will face a long winter.
I trust that it will not be, especially given my experience in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, the same regime that once occupied the building that served as my embassy.
My mother survived the Holocaust, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she asked me to light candles on a table with a swastika on it during the Sabbath.
With such a cultural heritage, how can I be pessimistic about our future?

Rangers' Graham Dorrans is confident ahead of the Rapid Wien game
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, with victory over the Austrians securing their place in Group G of the Europa League after an unexpected draw with Spanish side Villarreal.
Midfielder Graham Dorrans has been ruled out of the season due to a knee injury, but he feels that, based on this result, the Rangers can set themselves up with some bold goals.
"It was a great point against Villarreal", said the 31-year-old.
We believed we could score points, and we scored points.
We might have scored another goal at the end, but we can't complain about the draw.
They were better in the first half, and we were better in the second half.
Thursday night is another big European game.
I hope we get the three points, but it won't be easy, because they were pretty good in their last match, but with our fans behind us, we'll definitely have the strength to win.
Last year was a tough one, I got injured, there were a lot of changes around the club, but now the mood is very optimistic.
We're a good team, the guys are enjoying the game, the training is going well.
I hope that if we give it our all, we can put the previous season behind us and achieve good results.
Many women worry that they won't save enough for their old age.
The survey participants had clear ideas about what kind of care they wanted for their elderly, but only a few spoke about it with their family members.
Nationwide's survey found that only half of respondents discussed the expected cost of their elderly care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
"Everyone wants a family member to take care of them, but they don't bring it up", says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
The following are worth doing.
First, discuss the matter with your mate and children: You cannot expect them to care for you properly if you do not tell them in time what your needs are.
Together with your counselor and your family, you will decide where and what care you want; these decisions will greatly affect future costs.
Involve a financial adviser: he or she may offer useful suggestions on how to pay for planned care.
Financing can be done with a traditional old-age insurance policy or a hybrid life insurance policy that combines savings with expenses or can be used as a hedge against your own assets... if you have the resources to do so.
Prepare legal documentation: This will cut down on the possibility of future litigation.
You can have a representative, a trusted person, who will represent you in health matters, oversee your medical care, and make sure that everything is done as you expect it to be, even if you are unable to communicate.
You can also ask someone to handle your finances.
This trusted person makes the necessary financial decisions and ensures that bills are paid when you are unable to do so.
Remember the little details too: Suppose your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about your medications and allergies?
Record these data in writing so that they are available at any time.
It's not just the financial issues that need to be clarified, it doesn't matter who your doctor is.
 What medicines are you taking?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Everything has to be planned.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed when a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, with authorities saying the death toll could rise.
The communications network in the region has also been damaged, so there is no news from Donggala Governorate, north of Palau, which was the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 residents of Palub had to be evacuated.
Some important facts about Palur and Donggala on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes, built on the west coast of the island of Celebes, at the end of a narrow bay, in 2017 its estimated population was 379 800 inhabitants.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was struck by an earthquake and tsunami.
The Donggala Governorate extends over 300 km along the northwest coast of Celebes Island.
The population of the Governorate  administrative region smaller than the province  was approximately 299 200 in 2017.
Central Celebes is characterised primarily by fishing and agriculture, especially in the coastal areas of Donggala.
Nickel mining is an important sector of the economy, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the other side of Celebes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, Palut and Donggala have been hit by tsunami several times in the past 100 years.
A 1938 tsunami killed more than 200 residents and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, West Donggala was hit by a flood, and nine people died.
Indonesia is located in the geologically active Pacific Ring of Fire, which is why earthquakes are common.
Just a few of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a massive tsunami began off the western coast of Aceh province in North Sumatra, triggering a tsunami that affected 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, with more than half of the deaths occurring in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong quakes rocked the west coast of Sumatra between late March and early April.
On the island of Nias, near Sumatra, several hundred died.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and a tsunami that followed killed nearly 700 on the southern coast.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake devastated Padang, near the capital of West Sumatra province.
Over 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake shook an island in the Mentawai archipelago near Sumatra, triggering a 10-metre tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: A near-surface earthquake struck Aceh Pidie Jaya Governorate, causing panic and devastation that many remembered from the 2004 tsunami.
A flood did not occur this time, but more than 100 residents were killed under the collapsed buildings.
2018: Lombok, a popular Indonesian island among tourists, was hit by a powerful earthquake that killed 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
Thousands of buildings were razed to the ground, and thousands of tourists were stranded on the island for a time.
Sarah Palin's oldest son has been arrested on a domestic violence charge.
Track Palin, the son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, is suspected of domestic violence, obstruction of report of domestic violence, and resisting arrest, according to the Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when a woman's acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he took her phone.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su Detention Center under a $500 bail order, KTUU reported.
On Saturday, he appeared in court and, when asked about his guilt, he said he was not guilty at all.
Palin is charged with three Class A felonies, punishable by up to four years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
In addition, you're charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which carries a one-day jail sentence and a $2,000 fine.
Palin's not the first time she's had run-ins with the law.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, reported the alleged assault to the police.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence and obstruction of justice, and possession of a firearm while under the influence of alcohol in connection with the case.
Her girlfriend at the time claimed that the man had punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was also criticized by several veterans' organizations in 2016 when she attributed her son's behavior to post-traumatic stress from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake Friday on the Indonesian island of Celebes.
The 7.5-magnitude quake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
The systems responsible for power and telecommunications have been disabled, and the death toll is likely to rise in the coming days.
The quake was centered near Central Celebes, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
There have been a number of videos on social media about the arrival of the tsunami.
On the beach of Palu, several hundred people gathered for a celebration, when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal prosecutors have requested the death penalty for the New York City terrorist suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack that killed eight people in New York City, the state's first execution since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of driving a rented truck from Home Depot up a bike lane on the Lower Manhattan West Side Highway in October, crushing a number of pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov deliberately killed eight of his victims and intended to inflict injury, according to a filing with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.
According to the document, the evidence of either of these two charges could justify the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was charged with 22 crimes, including eight counts of murder for extortion, which until then had been used almost exclusively against organized crime, and damage and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "considerable planning and deliberation", prosecutors say, and Saipov's actions were "relevant, cruel, inhuman".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused pain and loss to the family of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco  is included in the complaint.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The Southern District of New York last requested the death penalty for a defendant a decade ago.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of killing two drug dealers, but in September of 2009, he was sentenced to life in prison.
The last federal execution in New York was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were convicted two years earlier of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Uzbek-born Saipov, according to court records, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
During interrogation, he said he took pleasure in the act.
Saipov said that watching ISIS videos on his phone gave him the idea for the attack, according to the indictment.
Police say he asked for an ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room.
He has pleaded not guilty to all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the public defenders representing Saipov, said he was understandably disappointed in the prosecutors' decision.
In our view, the actual life sentence for a confession would have been more favourable, the death penalty would only prolong the suffering of all those involved in the case  Patton says.
Saipov's lawyers had earlier asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty for their client.
A Tory MP says that Nigel Farage should be leading the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage, at a protest at a Tory conference, said he was calling for a people's army to fight.
The former leader of Ukip said politicians should feel the pressure from Eurosceptics after a Theresa May supporter suggested that Farage should be given the job of negotiating with the EU.
Peter Bone, a non-official Conservative, told the Birmingham rally that the UK would have left the EU long ago if Farage had been Brexit minister.
It's a good indication of the pressure inside the party on May that the Remain Tories have spoken at another anti-Brexit demonstration in the city.
May is trying to implement the Chequers plan, which requires a permanent clearing of Brexit and Remain and the EU.
His allies say that despite the backlash, he is trying to strike a deal with Brussels so that the Eurosceptics and Labour can choose between his package and total chaos.
At the Leave Means Leave protest in Solihull, Bone said the Chequers deal had to be scrapped.
It suggested that Farage should be elevated to the House of Lords and entrusted with the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge of the negotiations, we would have left already", he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: 'I'm in favour of Brexit but the Chequers deal has to be scrapped.'
Criticising the EU, he said: "We did not fight the world wars to be the servants of others.
We want to make our own laws.
Bone rejected the assumption that public sentiment had changed since the 2016 vote: "There is no basis in reality for the British people to change their minds and want to stay".
Andrea Jenkyns, a Tory Brexit Party MP, was also present at the rally and told reporters: "All I ask is that you, Madam Prime Minister, listen to the voice of the people.
The Chequers deal is being rejected by public opinion, the opposition will not vote for it, it's unpopular with party members and especially with the activists who are working on the ground and who helped us get into government.
Forget the Chequers deal and keep an eye on us.
In a corollary message to May, he added: "Only a Prime Minister who keeps his word can hold his chair".
Farage told the gathering that politicians must feel the pressure not to betray the results of the 2016 referendum.
The trust between us, the people and our politicians, is now at stake.
They want to sell Brexit, and we're here today to beat them, we're not going to let them do it.
In these words, she addressed the enthusiastic crowd: "I would like our politicians who are preparing to betray Brexit to feel the pressure.
We call on the people's army to fight for victory over Brexit and we will not rest until we have made the United Kingdom an independent, sovereign, proud country once again.
The Remainers, meanwhile, marched on Birmingham and then held a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Some activists were waving the flag of the 'Tory' movement against Brexit at the weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis has been criticised by the Conservatives for security flaws in the party's security at the opening of the conference.
These people said they had the IT background for a Canada-plus-plus agreement, for a seamless border crossing and a borderless free trade agreement with Ireland.
They're just talking to you.
There is simply no good Brexit, he stressed.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
Senator Elizabeth Warren has said that after the November election she will seriously consider running for president.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of Donald Trump, is up for re-election in November against state Republican Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There's been speculation for some time that he might be the man to succeed Trump in 2020.
The event Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was the 36th public forum of electors since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked if he planned to run for president.
Warren responded by saying it was time for women to take a role in Washington in the overthrow of the misguided government, including occupying the top position.
The suspect in the shooting of LSU player Sims has been arrested.
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police announced on Saturday that they had arrested a suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference held at 11 a.m. Eastern time today the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson.
Earlier, they posted a video of the shooting on Friday asking for help in identifying the man in the video.
Sims, 20, was fatally shot near the campus of Southern University early Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims suffered a head injury from the gunshot wound that proved fatal", police Captain Murphy J. Paul told reporters Saturday, according to a report from 247sports.
He stepped in to protect Wayde's friend, and that's when Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted during his interrogation that he was at the scene, that he had a gun, and that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson's arrest was made without incident, and the man was taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
A Baton Rouge senior, Sims, a 6-foot-2, played in 32 games last season, 10 as a starter, and averaged 17.4 minutes per game, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closer to the world title after team-sanctioned victory over Sebastian Vettel
With Valtteri Bottas having qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was immediately clear that the Mercedes team's instructions would play a big part in the race.
Starting from pole position, Bottas started well and almost got Hamilton into trouble, as he defended his position in the first two laps, allowing Vettel to attack his team-mate.
First, Vettel stood in the boxing ring and let Hamilton get stuck in the traffic behind the midfield, which should have been the deciding factor.
Mercedes came out a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook after a close action in which the Ferrari driver reluctantly let the inside arch free after making two defensive moves in the third corner.
Celebrating his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen started from the back of the starting grid and by the end of the first lap was seventh.
He then led for much of the race, as he did not change his tyres to make a quick run to the finish and overtake Kimi Räikkönen in the hope of fourth place.
Finally, he was able to get into the pits on lap 44, but he could not improve his pace in the remaining eight laps, so Räikkönen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day because Valtteri had done a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman when he was told to let go.
"The team has done an outstanding job to secure the top two spots", said Hamilton.
His body language was very bad.
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally Saturday after the senator insisted she was not the one who leaked Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
At the West Virginia rally, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but simply stated that what was happening in the Senate proved that people are "loathsome, hateful and liars".
"What can happen, and what's wonderful about what's happened in the Senate in the last few days, is when you see the anger, when you see people being angry, mean, hateful and lying", he said.
If you look at the statements and the leaks, they say, "Oh, that wasn't me.
That wasn't me.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, you were leaked?
Remember your answer -- did you leak the document?
Oh, no, not at all.
I didn't leak it.
Well, let's stop for a second.
Did we leak...? No, we didn't leak. " He added, imitating the senator.
The letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein by Ford in July and leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak was from his office.
I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, and I did not leak his story. Feinstein told the committee according to The Hill's account.
Arra asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential as he requested.
But it seems that his denial was not accepted by the president, who noted at the meeting on Saturday evening: "I'll tell you what: your speech was very bad.
Maybe he didn't leak it, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen.
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court nominee accused by three women of sexual harassment, claiming that Democrats are using the allegations to advance their own agenda.
They were determined to regain power by any means necessary.
They see the triviality, the abomination, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to trample on to gain power and control", quoted the president by Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars and the Belfast Giants three to one
Giants' Patrick Dwyer scored two goals in the game against Dundee
With a 5-3 victory in the Dundee home rematch on Saturday, the Dundee Stars have paid for their loss to the Belfast Giants in Friday's Elite League match.
With Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier, the Giants have an early two-goal lead.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the home game, and Dwyer has regained the lead.
Francois Bouchard equalized the Dundee loss, and then Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals to secure the victory.
Adam Keefe's men have won their third Elite League game of the season, beating Dundee 2-1 on Friday night in Belfast.
The two teams met for the fourth time this season, with the Giants winning the last three games.
Dwyer's opening goal in the fourth minute, at 3:35, was scored off Kendall McFaull's goal, then four minutes later, with David Rutherford assisting, Beauvillier doubled their lead.
In a twisting opening third, Sullivan brought the home side back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt's pass to Cownie equalized at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants were in the lead going into the break when he scored his second goal of the night in the bottom of the first inning.
The home team reorganized their lineup, and Bouchard again equalized with a personal best of 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran's combined play helped Nielsen take the lead for Dundee towards the end of the second third for the first time in the match, then ensured victory with his team's fifth goal in the last third of the game.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, return to Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller died to save hundreds of people on the plane from the earthquake
A flight controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after he lost his life while ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people safely took off.
More than 800 people were killed and many more were missing after the island of Celebes was hit by a major earthquake on Friday, which was followed by a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to be felt in the area, and many people are trapped under the rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite the fact that his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the tower of control at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palou.
He stayed there to safely board Batik Air flight 6321 which was already on the runway.
Then he jumped off the traffic control tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
According to Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait, the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News of Australia reported.
We arranged for a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter could reach Palu.
We were heartbroken when we heard the news.
Authorities fear the death toll could be in the thousands, and the country's disaster relief agency says Donggala, Sigi and Boutong are all inaccessible.
The number of victims is likely to continue to rise as many are trapped under the rubble and many have not been reached said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the organisation.
Waves as high as 20 feet [6 m] destroyed Palou, where a mass funeral was held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are delivering aid and supplies.
A 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: "Ambulances are bringing in more bodies every minute.
There's a shortage of clean water.
The shops were looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, the Indonesian head of the International Red Cross told CNN: The Indonesian Red Cross is racing against time to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
This is a tragedy, but it could be worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and asked the country's soldiers: I ask all of you to work day and night on evacuation related tasks!
Are you ready?
Indonesia has already been hit this year by earthquakes off the island of Lombok, killing more than five hundred and fifty people.
Micronesian air crash: Air Niugini reports one person missing in the plane crash in the lagoon
The latest report from the airline operating a plane that crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia says one person is missing, though it was previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were successfully evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini's press release says that as of Sunday afternoon, a male passenger is unavailable.
The airline says it's working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to further information about the passenger, such as questions regarding his age and nationality.
Local vessels helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water during landing at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline says there are six passengers in the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact course of events are not yet clear.
According to the airline and the U.S. Navy, the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses say the plane went off the runway.
An American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane was flying very low.
"This is a tremendously good thing", commented Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others were able to tread water to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed, and he suffered a minor head injury.
According to the U.S. Navy, crews from a nearby dock were assisting in the rescue effort, and a float boat was used to transport the people to shore before the plane sank 30 feet [30 m] into the water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG-registered airlines in the past two decades, but none involving Air Niugini.
An analyst has put together the events of the night a woman was burned alive.
The prosecutor on Saturday introduced the defendant to the man at the retrial, who is accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst for the United States Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to piece together the movements of the accused, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and the victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said she was given location data from several phones that suggested she was with Tellis Chambers the night of her death, contradicting his previous claims, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the records showed that his phone was in the vicinity of Chambers's when the man claimed he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, the police questioned Sanford.
Sanford gave his testimony on Saturday, saying he wasn't in town that day.
When prosecutors asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said Tellis lied because he was in Nashville with my truck.
Another contradiction was that Tellis said that she had known Chambers for about two weeks at the time of her death.
According to the cell phone records, they'd only known each other for a week.
Rowlett reported that after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted her text messages, calls, and contacts from her phone.
"You've erased him from your life", Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said the case is expected to go before the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hippie trio has challenged the genre's negative outlook by infusing their music with positive messages.
According to Bristol's The High Breed, hip-hop has moved away from its roots of political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to these roots and re-popularize conscious hypnosis.
Performers such as The Fugees and Common are enjoying a resurgence of popularity in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black guy?
A nanny in New York sued for firing a party after a racist message.
A nanny in New York City is suing a couple for discriminatory firing after a wrongly-sent message from her mother complaining that they had hired another black nanny.
The couple denies being racist and liken the lawsuit to extortion.
The mother of two, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed her disappointment when she was told that she was black on her first day of work by her new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, in 2016.
"I'm sorry, but I'm a woman again", Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
However, instead of your husband, you sent the message to Ms. Maurice, twice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman, feeling uncomfortable, fired Ms. Maurice, claiming that the departing maid, who was African-American, had done a bad job and was more likely a Filipino.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a day's work and then sent home in an Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for redundancy and is seeking $350 a day in compensation for the six-month work-in-residence that he was originally hired for, albeit without a contract.
I want to show them how to stop the march, that's not the way to do it he told the Post on Friday, adding: I know it's discrimination.
The couple responded to the allegations of racism by saying that terminating Maurice's employment was reasonable because they were afraid that they could not trust him after being offended.
My wife sent him something he didn't mean.
It's not racist.
We're not racists. " That's what her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
But would you entrust your children to someone who was rude to you, even if it was by accident?
His newborn?
What the fuck?
Plasco, who likened the case to blackmail, said his wife had just given birth to a baby two months ago and was in a very difficult situation.
Would you attack someone like that?
"That's not a very nice thing to do", added the investment banker.
While the legal process is going on, the court of public opinion has already swiftly condemned the party on social media, condemning their behavior and logic.
A letter just found says that Paddington's publisher was afraid that readers would not be able to relate to a talking bear.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book's acceptance, said of the letter: "It's hard to imagine being someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
It's quite amusing to have this information now that we know how big a success Paddington is.
He said his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write a children's book about a baby kitten, would not have resented being rejected for his work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication had been a miserable failure following his father's death last year.
He called Paddington a very important member of their family, adding that his father was very proud of his eventual success.
"He was a very quiet man, not at all conceited", she said.
But since Paddington was almost real to him, he was like a child who was carrying something: we're proud of him even if it's not really our merit.
I think Paddington's success was somehow based on that.
Although he created it and it sprang from his imagination, he always credited Paddington with his success.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone.
On landing, she and her daughter rushed to the Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain for her life.
"Nad called regularly to tell me that he was in very bad shape and that he was not expected to survive", said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I got a call from Nad saying that my daughter was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
I said thank you.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication that doctors had given him to keep his heart beating slowed down and left his system.
He was dead before, and then everything stopped.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing it was all over.
I couldn't cry or scream or cry because I was in a place where I was surrounded by families and people.
I couldn't leave myself.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, by now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the rest of the group, who were not bothered by the ordeal she had just endured.
Nobody knew what he said.
I just kept bowing my head and crying the whole time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt this overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needs my love and my understanding.
I knew he loved my daughter very much.
Poster with mourning women to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from throwing their lives away.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys were hanging postcards with inspirational messages and emergency numbers on a bridge in Wales.
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he became depressed and committed suicide at 18.
I don't want any parent to feel the same way I feel every day.
Ms. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook and his smile was on everyone's face.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that your smile lights up any place.
However, before his death, he had to give up his job because he was in a very bad state.
Tyler, who took his own life, was found by his brother, who was 11 years old at the time.
Ms. Davis said, "I was constantly worried that this was going to cause some sort of domino effect".
Ms. David made these postcards to let people know that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't sit quietly You need to talk
Ms. Humphreys, who had been a friend of Ms. Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after the death of his mother.
He didn't say he was depressed or anything.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was totally out of it on Christmas day, when the kids opened their presents, not looking them in the eye and stuff.
He said that his death was a huge trauma for them, but they had to deal with it: it left a huge hole in the family.
He tore our hearts to pieces.
But we must continue the fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in question as the FBI begins its investigation
"I thought if we could achieve what he's asked for, a limited-time, limited-size investigation, we might be able to come to an agreement", Mr. Flake said Saturday, adding that the committee was afraid of falling apart because of the party's indecisiveness.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters oppose an FBI investigation?
Their resistance is due entirely to timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, November 6th, and if the Republicans don't perform well, expectations are that it's going to be much harder for them to get their man on the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators and lobby them for support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases its report?
The Senate is currently in a vote, with 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will get the minimum 50 votes in the Senate that would allow Vice President Mike Pence the power to impeach Mr. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
North Korean dissidents have dwindled under Kim's rule
The number of North Korean defectors going to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong Un took power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker has said.
Park Bjung-sok cited data from the Southern Union Ministry and said there were 1,127 dissidents in the last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that the tighter border between North Korea and China and the higher penalties for human traffickers were the main reasons.
Phenjan has not commented publicly on this information.
Most of the northern dissidents eventually become South Korean citizens.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most of them escape to China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats dissidents as illegal immigrants, not as refugees, and often sends them back by force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still practically at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
The two leaders met in Pyongyang earlier this month to discuss the stalled nuclear disarmament talks.
This came in the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they agreed to the broad outlines of further cooperation on the Korean peninsula's nuclear-free status.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jongho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the American people, there is no trust in our national security, and under these circumstances, it is unthinkable for us to unilaterally disarm", Ri said in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and "unfit for the Supreme Court".
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said his behavior was not appropriate for a Supreme Court justice.
Pelosi said this in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"It occurred to me that if a woman ever behaved like that, "I would call her hysterical". "He explained Pelosi's reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony, "which she gave before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has voiced an emotional protest against reports that he sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as a teenager.
In his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost shouting and his voice breaking as he spoke about his family and his years in high school.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him "grotesque and a coordinated character assassination" by liberals angry at Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential defeat.
Pelosi said that she believed Kavanaugh's behavior proved he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court, as it showed that he was biased against Democrats.
I think he's shutting himself out with the kind of statements and behavior that he's been making against the Clintons and the Democrats.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he took office and the Democrats gained a majority in the House.
"I'm telling you, if you don't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, you're not only not good enough for the Supreme Court, but you're not good enough for the court you're sitting on right now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh currently serves as a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions regarding the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as Kavanaugh is considered a conservative judge.
During his hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn Supreme Court decisions.
"This is no time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to enter the courtroom and expect us to fly with joy", Pelosi said.
And the women have to hold it in their hands.
It's a legitimate outburst, a rage that's been building up for months and years, and it's not coming out without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's that rare, is it?
"I was very helped by a woman who worked in a management position somewhere", she continued. "She told me that she cries in anger, but she developed a technique where, when she cries in anger, she says to her interlocutor, 'You may think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm really mad.
And then he just kept going.
And I thought, "This is a great idea".
Part of the reason they dismiss tears as a sign of anger is that they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories from an early day at my job, a male-dominated office, where I once began to cry in a fit of angry helplessness, was being grabbed by the neck by an older woman, a cool manager I had always feared, and taken out to the stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry", he told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they're happy because they've managed to upset you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having an extramarital affair with a woman named Monkey Business and was eliminated from the race, Ms. Schroeder, in her frustration, figured there was no reason why she couldn't run for president herself.
It wasn't a well-thought-out decision, he told me laughingly 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates in the race, and they wanted the newest candidate in the middle of their backs.
Someone called it "Whitehead and the Seven Dwarfs".
With the campaign now long overdue, Ms. Schroeder was behind with her fundraising, so she vowed not to run unless she raised the $2 million.
It was a battle that was doomed from the start.
He realized that some of his supporters had given the men $1,000, but he had only received $250.
"Did they think I was getting a discount?" he wondered.
When he held a press conference to announce that he would not be launching an official campaign, he was so overwhelmed by the emotion of gratitude for the people who supported him, and by the frustration and anger over sexism over a system that made it difficult to raise money and reach voters directly, that he choked.
"They thought I was having a nervous breakdown", Ms. Schroeder quoted the press reaction.
They thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to write on my tombstone?
I'm not crying.
How could a US-China trade war be good for Beijing?
The opening salvo of the US-China trade war has been almost deafening, and while the battle is nowhere near over, experts say the fracture between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning at the beginning of the year by imposing tariffs on key Chinese export products including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation has occurred this week, as the new tariffs have already hit $200 billion worth of goods, effectively taxing half of all goods going from China to the U.S.
Beijing has retaliated in every case, most recently imposing tariffs of between five and 10 percent on $60 billion worth of American products.
China has vowed to fight back every time, and the world's second largest economy is certainly not going to back down anytime soon.
If you want to get Washington to back down, it means you have to give up your waist to the demands, but publicly bowing to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressure of the US trade war could be good for China in the long run, as it reduces the dependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick decision in either Washington or Beijing could create conditions that could send either country's economy into a economic whirlwind is far more serious than observers have previously acknowledged", said Abigail Grace, research assistant for Asia at the New American Security think tank.
Syria is ready to allow the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild a country that has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
In his speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Moallem claimed that the country's situation was improving.
The current situation is more stable and secure, thanks to the achievements in the fight against terrorism, he said.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists, restoring normal conditions.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees who have had to flee between terrorism and economic measures taken arbitrarily, which affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
An additional six million people in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Moallem said that the Syrian state would welcome any help to rebuild the country.

Europe has won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the USA team 16.5:10.5 at Le Gold National outside Paris.
The U.S. has now lost six straight times on the European stage and hasn't won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe defended their title as Danish captain Thomas Bjørn's team scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
Phil Mickelson, the American star, who had been struggling all tournament, dropped his par-3 shot on the 16th hole, giving Francesco Molinari the win.
The Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all of the events, becoming one of only four players to ever achieve a 5-0-0 record since the tournament began in its current form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5-4 by the lowest ranked player in the European team, the Dane Thorbjørn Olsen.
Dustin Johnson, one of the best players in the world, lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have been on his last Ryder Cup.
Eight-time Ryder Cup veteran Sergio Garcia of Spain is the tournament's all-time leading scorer with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry, but today I couldn't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so very happy, I'm so happy to have my cup back.
It's all about the team and I'm happy to have been able to help", said the emotional Garcia after his European victory.
He hands the baton to Jon Rahm, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods in a two-and-one on Sunday.
"I feel incredible pride to have beaten Tiger Woods, the man I grew up watching", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
That's a strange statistic from one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 world titles, and is second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has been struggling all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have been excellent golfers throughout the tournament.
Team captain Jim Furyk of the U.S.A. said after the disappointing result that he was proud of these guys, because they fought.
There was a time this morning when we lit the Europe.
We fought.
Hats off to Thomas.
A great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're gonna move our team, and we're gonna work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee to move forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You guys need to raise your hats, too.
The enemy was better than us".
