A 9-year-old boy was found on the run in Tampere.
The police have been on a search mission for a 9-year-old boy who escaped in Tampere on Tuesday night.
A missing boy who left West Tampere with a friend has been reported on social media.
Police say the boy has been contacted and is not in any danger to life or health.
The boy's father told the Night-Words at midnight that the boy had been found.
He's fine, and now we're gonna start the follow-up.
The boy was found near the house, his father said.
Ronaldo is back in the game . He 's ripping the goal off Messi .
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish league this weekend and continued his exploits in the Champions League.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo for the Champions League goal-kicking title turned, at least for a moment, in the latter's favour.
Real Madrid's Ronaldo single-handedly moved into the top of the all-time goalscoring list when he scored two goals from penalty kicks and one from a game situation in the goal of visiting Shahtar Donetsk.
Ronaldo has raised his average to 80 after Barcelona's Messi, who had tied him before Tuesday, has a total of 77 goals.
Real won the match 4-0.
Juventus have been stumbling in Serie A since the start of the season, but in the Champions League D-League they started strong with a 2-1 away win over Manchester City.
The winning goal was scored by Juventus' Alvaro Morata with over ten minutes to go.
The City offense was bored by the absence of the knee-jerk Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, who was injured in a preseason game this weekend, didn't get on the field until the final 10 minutes.
Manchester United's other side also suffered in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after suffering a 1-2 defeat.
ManU's 20-year-old quarterback Luke Shaw was only able to get a 15-minute overtime.
PSV's Hector Moreno's dangerous-looking slide hit the attacking ManU pack so hard that Shaw probably broke his leg.
Shaw lay on the lawn of Eindhoven's home stadium for 10 minutes before paramedics left to take him to the hospital.
Memphis Depay took the visitors to a 1-0 lead in the 41st minute, but ManU's joy lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno evened it before extra time.
The PSV winning goal in the second half was scored by Luciano Narsingh.
The Champions League season opens with the A-League side Paris Saint-Germain.
It was Angel Di Maria, the Argentine who traded his Manchester United shirt for a PSG shirt.
Di Maria broke through from the right and lifted the ball past Malmö goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani scored 2-0 for PSG in the second half.
PSG is being touted as one of the most successful teams of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, which is a member of the league's small clubs, is not the best possible place to compare.
PSG star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic faced his former club Malmö FF for the first time in his professional career.
Ibrahimovic started his career at Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes as his team, Moscow's TsSKA, lost a B-block game in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party demanded his immediate resignation . The president made a false speech .
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe gave the same speech he had a month ago.
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has again delivered the same speech to the country's parliament as he did at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently didn't realize it was the same.
The speech raised doubts about whether 91-year-old Mugabe was at his best.
The main opposition party, the MDC, demanded that Mugabe step down as he was too old to rule.
Mugabe's aides were quick to say that the interference had taken place only in Mugabe's headquarters and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe's speech was earlier and now about China's impact on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria call for an extra summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have proposed an extraordinary summit of EU leaders next week in response to the refugee crisis.
The European Council President Donald Tusk, who chairs the summits, evaluated the request.
The German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that the Heads of State and Government should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how to register more effectively.
The European Parliament has also voted to approve the Commission's proposal to increase the number of EU citizens in the EU.
Professor admits to shooting his girlfriend on an emergency call.
University professor Shannon Lamb made an emergency call to the police at his home, saying he had shot his girlfriend.
Lamb specifically mentioned that their beloved dog was there and alive and probably scared, and the professor said that the contact information of the dead woman's family was on her phone.
Inside the house, police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note on a white sheet of paper that read, "I am very sorry and I hope I can undo what I did.
There was no sign in the house that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the campus when police found Ethan Schmidt, a history professor who was believed to have been shot, dead outside his study.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that the university authorities received a report of a shooting at 10:18 a.m.
She said Lamb made the fatal 911 call sometime after this.
There was one more death in the day, and Lamb took his own life when police caught up with him.
The day after the shooting, students and faculty remained locked behind locked doors, and authorities were still trying to determine Lamb's motive.
Researchers at both sites looked into the details, and teachers who knew Lamb told them about the man, and they came up with an image of a gifted but perhaps troubled teacher.
The students always said they looked forward to the professor's lessons.
According to the Gautier Police Department at the scene of Prentiss' death, the professor had no prior history of violence or crime.
Schmidt, in turn, had mentioned Lamb in a book he had written, in which he had given credit to "the wonderful people" with whom he had been able to spend his academic life.
Both worked in the Department of Social Sciences and History, where 17 members of the teaching staff were employed.
However, signs of problems emerged.
Brandon Beavers, a student who praised Lambia, said that the professor seemed excited and nervous "as if something were wrong".
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb had told him at the end of the 2014-2015 school year that he was suffering from stress.
Lamb had previously requested a sick leave from Delta State University due to some medical problem.
This year, he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's hiring policy meant that the thesis Lamb had worked hard to obtain would not automatically guarantee him an assistant professorship.
University president William LaForge said he was not aware of the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but noted that something was clearly bothering Lamb.
These are questions Lamb can no longer answer.
After leaving campus, police were able to determine which route Lamb had taken from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Before police caught up with Lamb, he had taken his own life with a .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a house in Greenville, Mississippi, about a mile from his parents' home, said Washington County coroner Methel Johnson.
Lamb's car was still running in the yard.
Police were not immediately able to determine why Lamb had gone to this particular house, but Johnson said he believed he knew the residents.
He spent his youth in the area.
Lamb started her career as a geography and education teacher at a university with 3,500 students.
She got her doctorate in education this spring.
One of Lamb's longtime friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston told me that she met Lamb through mutual friends when she was 15 and Lamb was 20.
He was still in high school with his friends, and Lamb was an interesting older guy who tried for years to teach Hairston to play guitar.
"Lamb was quite the heartbreaker back then.
All the girls were on him", said Hairston, now 40, of Brandon, a suburb of Jackson.
Apparently, Lamb and Prentiss had been dating for a while.
On the 911 call, Lamb said he killed his wife, but there's no record of them being married.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, and they lived in a brick house on a riverbank in the small town of Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband Shawn O'Steen revealed that he and Prentiss separated 15 years ago, but the couple remained friends and have a daughter, now 19.
"He was completely shocked", O'Steen said of his daughter.
"My daughter and my mother were best friends".
O'Steen had never met Lamb, but had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb liked music and played the blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met when Lamb and Abigail both performed at a summer event three years ago.
Later, they sometimes played together.
O'Steen says his daughter writes and performs her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for a lot of companies over the Internet.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and part-time entertainment coordinator at the humble Julep Room restaurant outside Gautier, said he saw Lamb and Prentiss on September 5th, when Lamb was playing guitar and lip harp to a small audience.
There was no denying that something was wrong.
"Happy couple", Shaffer said.
"We were joking together.
They both had a good sense of humor".
"The late Professor Schmidt was a first-year seminarian specializing in Indian and colonial history", said English professor Don Allan Mitchell.
He was married, and he had three young children.
He attended Emporia State University in Kansas, where he was president of his fraternity and sorority.
On the campus of Delta State University in Cleveland, 900 people gathered for a candlelight memorial service, including faculty, staff, students and local residents.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and Brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the evening session, where the university choir performed "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
We're back in class on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get the students back", LaForge said.
"The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing".

Assistant reporters: Associated Press reporter Emily Wagster from the Trickster in Greenville, Mississippi and Rebecca Santana from New Orleans.
The case has been corrected, as police now say Lamb made the 911 call after Schmidt was shot, and it was also clarified that while Lamb made the 911 call referring to Prentiss as his wife, there is no evidence of their marriage.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us does not intend to hire as many seasonal workers as it did last year, but the toy and baby retailer says it will offer its existing employees and seasonal workers the possibility of working more hours.
The company plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centres across the country, and in 2014 it will hire 45,000 seasonal workers.
Most of the jobs are part-time.
Interviews with applicants will start this month and new recruits will start in October/December.
Although there are still months to go before the holiday season, the shopping season is fast approaching and companies are preparing by hiring temporary workers for shops and for shipping and delivery.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana.
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a pivotal moment in Michael J. Fox's career.
The first night was also a personal one.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royals to arrive, and I noticed there was an empty seat next to me, and it was obvious to me that Princess Diana was coming to my side", Fox said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary Back in Time.
"As the film began, I realized that the situation was very much like a date with the Princess of Wales".
The documentary is a companion to the Back to the Future films, and features interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson, Christopher Lloyd, director Robert Zemeck, and producer Steven Spielberg.
Back to the Future premiered 30 years ago.
"This film is definitely the time travel movie of all time for me", Spielberg stated.
Back in Time will be released on VOD and DVD, and will be shown in select theaters beginning in October.
The UN Secretary-General: No military solution to the crisis in Syria
Commenting on Russia's intensified military action, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that there is no military solution to the nearly five-year conflict and that weapons only bring more violence and suffering to millions of people.
The Secretary-General reiterated his call on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to join forces and support comprehensive negotiations to find a political solution.
The EU has also been involved in the negotiations on the accession of the Republic of Moldova to the European Union.
The resolution calls on the Commission to take all necessary steps to ensure that the EU's nuclear programme is implemented in a manner that is consistent with the principles of the United Nations Charter.
The European Union is committed to the implementation of the UN Security Council resolution on the situation in Syria.
Chapter 8 of the poll: Is Donald Trump serious?
There's been a lot of talk about Trump being a big talker.
He's also been considered a joke.
Some people predict a collapse for Trump.
Republican circles have (so far) tried in vain to pull Trump out of the race.
Eleven out of 11 national polls show double-digit support for Donald Trump, and some are already seriously considering what that actually says about the real estate mogul's chances of running.
But the election is still in its infancy.
Nowhere has it been announced yet that Trump will be elected as the Republican nominee.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry, who was at the top of the poll, was given a chance to make room for the rising Herman Cain, neither of whom ultimately won a statewide race.
There are many reasons why Trump would have a hard time getting elected.
Outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the economic conservative Club for Growth have noted Trump's strong position and have begun digging into the picture to topple him.
The following recent polling data show that the real estate market cannot be dismissed as a bullish market:
There's been a major shift in Trump's approval ratings.
Just before Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll found that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, 40 percent had a positive view.
In early August, the corresponding figure was 52%.
Now, six out of 10 Republicans have a positive image of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten people have a negative image.
These figures also hold in the states where elections are held first.
In a Quinnipiac poll last week, 60 percent of Republicans had a positive opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of Republicans would be happy with Trump's nomination.
In a CNN and ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were very, very happy with Trump's possible choice as the nominee.
Only two out of ten would be very unhappy with Trump's candidacy.
Ben Carson is getting almost as enthusiastic a reception as Trump (43% would be very happy with Carson's candidacy and 40% with Trump's candidacy).
Who's the next most popular candidate?
Third is Marco Rubio, with a corresponding approval rating of 21%.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans would be dissatisfied or very dissatisfied if Jeb Bush were elected as their nominee.
Most Republicans don't think Trump's temperament is a problem.
Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his arrogance and offensive comments, with 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide saying the qualities of a real estate mogul are appropriate for the president, according to opinion polls conducted by ABC News and the Washington Post.
The same is true of Iowa, where the convention is first: According to the Quinnipiac Gallup poll, 52 percent of Republicans consider Trump's personal qualities appropriate for the chief of staff.
However, according to an ABC/Post poll, 44 percent believe Trump is not capable of performing his duties effectively, and six in 10 think Trump's temperament is unsuitable for the White House.
Republicans are getting used to the idea.
They're starting to take Trump seriously.
When Republicans are asked who is most likely to be elected as the party's nominee, CNN and ORC polls show that four out of ten believe Trump has the potential.
Things have changed since mid-July, when four out of ten would have put their money on Jeb Bush.
Overall, the Republicans have never had a crystal ball that was very reliable.
At this point in the last election, four out of 10 Republicans thought Rick Perry was a likely candidate, compared to only 28 percent of Mitt Romney.
The majority seems to find Trump's campaign convincing.
Even if the Republicans back the other candidate, Trump is outnumbering almost all the other candidates.
Some experts believe that a divided camp is likely to benefit Trump as Trump opponents split into supporters of different candidates.
A Monmouth University poll in early September revealed that in a fictional duel between Trump and almost any other Republican candidate, Trump would almost always have the largest support pool on his side.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14, Walker by 15, Jeb Bush by 19, and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points each.
He's even with Ted Cruz.
Is Cruz the only real opponent of Trump?
Ben Carson would have won by 19 points over Trump in a fictional duel.
A slim majority of Trump supporters say they've already made a decision.
A CBS/NYT poll released Tuesday found that more than half of Trump's supporters are confident in their vote.
Of course, the situation can change for many reasons, and at this time a confident voter can also change his mind.
Forty-six percent of Trump supporters have not made a final decision.
Trump's current strongest rival is neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who have already chosen their nominee are twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans agree with Trump's views on immigration.
After Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico rapists in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been a hot topic in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's lavish speeches will drive important Latin American voters away from the Republican ranks and hinder the rebranding.
But according to ABC News and the Washington Post polls released Monday, six out of 10 Republicans are on the same page as Trump on immigration.
As long as immigration is in the spotlight, so is Donald Trump.
Discontent with the government is at an all-time high.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are currently collecting about half of the Republican vote combined, and the popularity is greatly enhanced by the fact that both of them have run unopposed.
The Republican Party wants a fresh face to run for office instead of a political stalwart, according to a recent ABC News and Washington Post poll, which found that six out of 10 Republicans agree.
These two candidates are also angry with Washington.
According to a Des Moines Register and Bloomberg Iowa poll, three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with Republican congressional performance: 54 percent dissatisfied and 21 percent on the verge of anger".
Jeremy Corbyn made his debut at the Prime Minister 's Question Time .
After the election, Corbyn's first appearance at the Prime Minister's Question Time has been eagerly awaited.
Jeremy Corbyn, the new Labour Party figurehead, is set to rise to his feet for the first time in a question-and-answer session with David Cameron later today.
Corbyn will be asking the first of his six questions shortly after noon, with the media and Labour Party representatives closely following him.
Corbyn has called for fewer theaters and added fact to the weekly show.
He has also stated that he can skip some of the meetings and leave them to his colleagues.
The meeting will be the first time Corbyn's leadership has been weighed in context, as he now faces a parliamentary test following his speech at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday.
The decision to silence the Labour Party's flag during the national anthem at the 75th anniversary of the air war in Britain on Tuesday has drawn criticism from several Tories and has made headlines in several newspapers.
Corbyn's silence during the national anthem has attracted attention.
Corbyn's spokesman said Corbyn stood during the national anthem, paying silent tribute to the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain.
However, Owen Smith, a member of Corbyn's shadow government, told BBC Two's Newsnight that he would have urged the party leader to join the national anthem despite his opposition to the monarchy.
Ten shadow ministers have refused to join Corbyn's first team, citing differences over economic, defence and foreign policy.
The BBC's policy correspondent Robin Brant believes that political differences over UK EU membership and government tightening on benefits have accumulated in the Labour Party since Corbyn's appointment.
Corbyn told the TUC meeting that Labour was going to propose changes to remove the restrictions completely.
Hours later, the shadow Labour and Pensions Minister Smith said the party's position was very clear: it was only against the government's plans to lower the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Corbyn is the fifth Labour leader to face David Cameron in the last decade as leader of the Tory Party.
The Labour leader, who has promised a new approach to politics, says he has chosen the questions to be asked of Cameron from among the 30,000 proposals he has received from the audience.
Mr Corbyn, from Islington North, said there was too much fighting in Question Time and vowed to avoid clever language and slang and focus instead on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and youth challenges.
Corbyn has stated that Shadow Secretary of State Angela Eagle will be his backer during interrogation sessions, for example when Cameron is abroad.
The Commission is also proposing that the Commission should be given a mandate to carry out a review of the Commission's proposals.
When Corbyn took over as party leader in 2005, Cameron said he wanted a puppet theatre policy, often associated with question-and-answer sessions.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, it has been seen as a key measure of the leader's judgment, the management of the House and his status, but critics say it has become a caricature that needs major reforms.
"Shot in Joburg": from homeless youth to photographers
Downtown Johannesburg is a challenging environment for the homeless.
For a group of former street kids, a meaningful way to learn and make money has been found.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit film studio that teaches homeless youth to photograph their home region and earn money at the same time.
BBC News met a young man who graduated first in his class.

The pound strengthens as wages rise in Britain
The pound strengthened as wages rose in the UK and SABMiller pulled up the FTSE 100 index.
In July, wages in the UK rose by 2.9% compared with the same period last year, not including bonuses.
The faster-than-expected growth was the fastest since 2009.
The pound strengthened by 1 percent to $1,5505 and also strengthened against the euro to $1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index increased by 1.49% to 6,229.21.
The biggest increase was made by SABMiller, which fell by 20% after receiving an initial bid from a competitor, AB InBevi.
If the transaction were to be completed, it would bring together the two largest bakeries in the world and bring under one roof brands including Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share price rose by 0.9% amid positive results from the competing Richemont Group, which focuses on luxury goods.
The latest Richemont sales figures are better than expected, with sales also showing an upward trend in Burberry's key market in China.
Glencore's stock rose 5 percent after the mining company announced its intention to raise $2.5 billion in an IPO as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The biggest drop was in Mond, a packaging and paper company, which fell 4.3 percent as Goldman Sachs cut its share price for the purpose of selling.
JD Sports' share price rose by 3,1% after the sports company was informed that its pre-tax profit would rise by 83% to £46.6 million.
JD Sports CEO: higher wage bill could hinder expansion
According to Peter Cowgill, Chairman of the Board of JD Sports, an increase in the minimum wage in the UK would increase purchasing power for potential customers.
However, the increased purchasing power is not sufficient to cover the higher labour costs incurred by the company.
According to Cowgill, the increase in labour costs may jeopardise JD Sports' expansion plans and reduce the need for additional labour.
Metcash launches a grassroots campaign against the Aldi landslide
Metcash is trying to secure its IGA store from the seizure of Ald in South and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to maintain market share in IGA retail stores in South and Western Australia against the A$700 million invasion of Aldi.
Aldi plans to open two distribution centres and the first of up to 120 stores in South and Western Australia early next year.Metcast and IGA supermarkets will strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand through marketing in mainstream media and social media, and by hosting events such as the Adelaide Show.
IGA stores and suppliers, as well as many brands, are involved in the campaign, such as Simmo, an ice cream factory in Dunsborough, which offers tastings in IGA stores and merchants who sell tickets to South Australian Football League games at a discounted price to regular customers.
Metcash is expected to release more details of its defense strategy on September 29th, when the food, alcohol and iron trade group will host its annual investment strategy day.
This is an important market, as South and Western Australia account for almost 30% of Metcash's IGA store footprint and have higher coverage than the IGA store network in the Eastern States.
South and Western Australian consumers are known for their cornering and IGA dealers have a significantly larger market share in the region than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland, with a market share of 30% in South Australia and 24% in Western Australia, while in the Eastern States they have only 14%.
For example, Morgan Stanley analysts believe that Aldi will capture 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first stores.
This week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA dealerships could sell for $360 million and Metcash could sell for $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South and Western Australia next year and reach sales of $500 million and $600 million in these regions.
Metcash's fixed costs are high, so a loss of food sales and volume could mean a loss of $13 million in earnings before interest and taxes, Kierath notes.
Meanwhile, Metcast is losing market share in the Eastern States, mainly to Ald and Coles, even though a recent study by Roy Morgan found that IGA's customers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food sales will decline by 3.8% in 2016, 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, and its market share will decline from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% by 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, chief portfolio manager at Magellan Financial Group, told an event in Melbourne that he thought it highly likely that Metcash would disappear entirely within 10 years.
Metcash has refused to comment publicly on Douglas's comments.
It's understandable that a member of the Metcash board contacted Douglas last week.
Since 2010, IGA's market share has fallen from 18% to 14% and the profit of Metcash's food business, which serves 1200 IGA dealers, has fallen by 43% from its 2012 level.
However, the wholesaler is taking countermeasures and is investing more than A$150 million a year to match the prices of hundreds of Coles and Woolworths products each week. e chain wants to help traders refurbish their stores to increase the supply of fresh produce and improve the food selection of its own brands.
According to Metcash's CEO Ian Morrice, the price revision and store renovation plans are progressing well and the company will be able to increase its profit again in 2017 for the first time in four years.
The president of the Australian Tennis Federation , Steve Healy , is defending Thanasi Kokkinak .
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves a special mention for his conduct rather than criticism.
According to Australian Tennis Federation president Steve Healy, Thanasi Kokkinakis has been a casualty in the recent Nick Kyrgios scandal, and deserves a special mention rather than criticism.
The younger member of the duo known as "Special K", Kokkinakis, came into the spotlight when the evil son Kyrgios provoked his opponent Stan Wawrinka at the ATP tournament in Montreal.
Soon afterward, in a qualifying match between Kokkinakis and Ryan Harrison in Cincinnati, the referee had to separate the two contestants twice. "Wawrinka should have kicked Kyrgiosis' back and that guy of mine", Harrison said.
At the US Open, Kokkinakis struck out in frustration on the batting cage after a massive cramp ruined his match.
Currently, the teen star is in Glasgow, where he will battle Sam Groth for second place in singles behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-finals against Great Britain.
"I strongly believe Thanasi has been drawn into the controversy", Healy said.
"He broke his bat in the loss at the US Open, and he's not the first player to break his bat out of frustration, and I know Thanas well enough that he's not proud of what he did.
But he has done very well, for example, with Harrison's provocative behaviour at the US Open, and I think he deserves credit.
He's got a strong team and a great family around him, but I just think he's been treated a little unfairly.
He's very mature for a 19-year-old, he works hard and he's a good addition to the team, he's never had any problems with the other players, and he's respected by the players, he trains hard, he's in good shape and he's a really stable and mature young man, and I think he should be judged on his own merits".
Healy also supported the decision to drop Kyrgios from the Australian team for the important round that begins on Friday, describing the decision as a joint decision that works for all parties, but he supports the return of the Canberra groom as a long-term reinforcement.
"First of all, we want to focus fully on the matches rather than the Kyrgios controversy", Healy said.
"Nick has risen to the top quickly, and as Federer and Murray have pointed out, he's going to have to grow up in the public eye, and he deserves the criticism he gets for his bad mistakes, but we're going to try to support him to understand the consequences of his actions, and we're going to try to get him to have his own peace, which I think is best for the whole team and for Nick".
European migrant crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders, detains migrants
Hungary, which has declared a state of emergency, closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday, seizing illegal immigrants to stem the flow of migrants.
Chaos was created at the border as hundreds of migrants piled up in no-man's-land, and Serbian authorities reacted angrily.
People fleeing violence were forced to stay indefinitely in their tents on the road between the country's checkpoints
Frustration started to surface.
As a police helicopter flew over the migrants, they shouted "Open the border!" and insulted the Hungarian riot police.
Some went on hunger strike in protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister said he would not accept the return of migrants to Hungary at the same time as more arrivals from Macedonia and Greece.
"Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not add to the damage.
The situation must be discussed in the coming days in Brussels and also in other countries", said Mr Dacic in Prague.
The unrest on the Hungarian-Serbian border began a day later when the 28-nation bloc failed to develop a common migration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
The Council also called on the Commission to take a more detailed look at the situation in the country and to take a more detailed look at the situation in the country.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for an extraordinary summit next week to discuss the continent's migrant crisis.
Hungary did not, however, place its hopes in the swift action of Brussels or its neighbours.
On Tuesday, the emergency situation in two southern regions allowed authorities to take more effective measures, such as closing roads and speeding up asylum procedures.
The European Union has also been involved in the fight against terrorism, and has been involved in the fight against terrorism.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports that even prisoners entered a bidding war to finish the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a clear bottleneck and transit point for migrants to the European Union, many of whom are refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
The EU's newly elected Prime Minister Viktor Orban said that the majority of people arriving were refugees for their livelihoods, not war refugees, with the right to seek asylum.
A new law in Hungary, which came into force at midnight, makes it a crime to cross or damage a 4-metre high barbed wire fence erected by the government on the southern border with Serbia.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the government is declaring a state of emergency", government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
"We're sticking to a strict line: illegal border crossing is a crime".
In practice, parliament still has to approve military action, which is expected next week, as Associated Press reporters have been seeing heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and military dogs on the border for several days.
Orban's internal security adviser, Gyorgy Bakondi, said authorities had arrested 45 attempted border crossings at the border and 15 further afield.
People who cross the border by breaking the fence are now in police custody, charged with crimes under the new laws.
The authorities will repair the fence quickly.
In addition, two of the seven border crossings with Serbia were closed by Hungarian authorities on Tuesday, one of which was closed by a railway carriage covered with barbed wire.
Chaos reigned at the main border crossing near Roszk, Hungary, when Hungarians opened a small metal container checkpoint where people packed in.
About 20 of them got in, but thousands stayed out.
Another group of migrants blocked the main road linking Serbia and Hungary, saying they were on a food and drink ban until they were allowed to return to Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders is down by half, according to national polls.
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is still in the double digits of the Democratic national nomination race, but Senator Bernie Sanders has come close.
Clinton now has 47% of the Democratic vote (down from 58%), while Sanders is second with 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced his candidacy for the presidency, and his approval rating among Democrats is 15 percent.
With more than five months before the primary, it's too early for most Democrats to say which candidate they're supporting.
But Clinton supporters are more confident in their choice than the other candidates.
Since CBS News' poll last month, Clinton has lost support in several Democratic groups, while Sanders' camp has seen a surge in support.
Clinton still has a solid lead among women and moderates, but her lead has narrowed.
Clinton's approval ratings among men have dropped dramatically, and she has a five percent lead over Sanders.
Clinton has lost her lead among Democrats under 50, and she's now tied with Sanders.
But Clinton still has a clear advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton's lead in the Liberal vote against Sanders was double digits, but now Sanders has taken a five-point lead over Clinton in this group.
About half of the Democrats say they would be happy to support Clinton if she were elected as the party's nominee.
A quarter would support Clinton with the least reservations, and 15% would support her just because she's a candidate.
Six percent would not support Clinton.
It is perhaps no surprise that Clinton's current supporters would be particularly enthusiastic supporters if she were elected.
There is more division among those who do not currently support Clinton, only about a quarter of whom would support her enthusiastically.
48% of the Democratic voters would support Clinton, while only 35% of the Republican voters would enthusiastically support the most popular Republican candidate, Donald Trump.
When Clinton voters are asked freely to describe why they support her candidacy, the most popular reason is Clinton's correct experience (16 percent), the second most popular answer is that it is time to choose a woman president (13 percent), and the third is that Clinton is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also mention her connection to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
It also mentions common views and chances of winning the actual election.
The vice president is still weighing his possible candidacy, and 57 percent of the Democratic voters would like him to run, while a third would prefer him out of the race.
When Democratic voters are asked about the second most popular candidate for the party's nomination, the majority vote for Biden.
For more than half of Clinton's supporters, Biden is the second most popular candidate after Clinton and far outpacing Sanders.
If Biden doesn't run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton will increase her lead over Sanders, which is 20 percentage points with Sanders, and it will increase to 30 percentage points if Sanders doesn't run.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters consider Clinton the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election, but that's down from 78 percent last month.
Biden, who is second, is a long way from Clinton, but more and more people believe Biden has a chance to win the election.
But Democratic voters put their opinions on issues above the candidates' chances of winning.
Voters don't find any Democratic candidate or potential candidate impossible to accept.
Voters consider the Democratic candidates or potential candidates as suitable for their characteristics.
Most people think of Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest, trustworthy, and leaders.
Biden is usually described as an honest man, while Clinton is usually seen as a leader.
As many as 30 percent of Democratic voters don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, 15 percent think Sanders is honest, and 27 percent can't say if Sanders is honest.
Democratic voters say the views of Clinton, Sanders and Biden are close to the voters' own ideology.
On all the traits, about a quarter have no opinion of Sanders.
When voters are asked for their views on Hillary Clinton's use of private email and her own server as Secretary of State, the majority of Democratic voters say they are satisfied with Clinton's explanation and it has not changed their perception of Clinton.
The American people, more broadly, disagree.
Half the American people are unhappy with Clinton's report, and only a third are.
Public opinion was divided in March, when the conflict had just come to light.
A majority of Americans feel that the controversial use of e-mail has not affected their overall image of Clinton, with 36 percent saying that it has changed in a negative direction.
Of these 36 percent, the majority, six out of ten, are Republicans.
Although Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by her own party voters, these qualities are subject to improvement when asked for the views of all voters: only 32 percent consider her honest and trustworthy, 8 percentage points less than last month and 15 percentage points less than in May.
62% of all voters don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy.
On the other hand, 55% of all voters in the entire country also don't think Trump is honest and trustworthy.
But both Clinton and Trump get good leadership grades.
Of the six candidates polled, Biden, Carson and Bush were considered the most credible.
Most people think Sanders is honest, but like Carson, a lot of people don't have an opinion about Sanders.
The sample of 351 voters, and the margin of error in the survey is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is holding onto Donald Trump's lead in the national opinion poll.
According to the latest CBS News and New York Times opinion polls, Ben Carson has overtaken Donald Trump.
These two candidates are up by more than half in the new poll, far outpacing the other candidates.
Trump's approval ratings among Republican voters across the country remain strong, rising from 23% in a CBS poll conducted before Fox News' debate last month to 27% in a poll released Tuesday.
However, Carson's approval ratings have risen dramatically over the same period, from 6 percent to 23 percent.
The poll shows Carson has strong support in all segments of the population, and in the college-educated segment, he's a close second to Trump.
The other candidates, except for Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, are far behind, while Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's approval rating is the weakest, down from 10 percent last month to 2 percent.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio split third with 6 percent of the vote.
The margin of error in the 376 Republican voters' sample is 6 percent one way or the other.
According to the latest CNN/ORC poll, released last week, Carson's approval rating is up, with 19 percent of Republicans supporting him, compared to Trump's 32 percent.
In the most recent poll by ABC News and the Washington Post, Trump was also a clear lead over Carson.
In a meeting with the men last week, Trump made unfounded accusations against a retired neurosurgeon, but Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy", Trump said on Saturday during his Iowa campaign.
Five members of the department charged in the death of Baruch College's fox.
Almost two years ago, after the death of a college student at a fraternity ritual in the Poconos Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people are facing murder charges.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity at Baruch College (City University of New York) brutally assaulted Chun "Michael" Deng at a September 2013 christening ceremony, and police said the fraternity failed to rush Deng to the hospital in time, which was believed to have contributed to his death.
Authorities said the victim was blindfolded, had a 50-pound bag of sand on his back, and had been repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a target on the other side of the icy field.
Deng reportedly complained of a headache and then lost consciousness.
Police say that the Pi Delta Psi unit did not call 911 when Deng lost consciousness, but they said they waited an hour before taking Deng to the hospital.
Police Chief Chris Wabner told a news conference that members still have time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms and contact the department's chairman, Andy Meng.
"At this point, members began to hide the equipment, putting the interests of the partnership ahead of Michael Deng's health", Wagner said.
Deng could not be revived, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was struck multiple times in the head, upper body and thighs with a blunt object.
"Too many families have been shocked by the school's cholera outbreak, with at least one student dying from cholera every year since 1970", said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer for Deng's family.
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the social partners are able to participate in the process.
A Monroe County grand jury has indicted five members of the department on charges of third-degree murder.
In addition, 32 members of the squad are charged with embezzlement and criminal conspiracy, including Meng.
"We want to hold not only individuals but also the organization that officially or unofficially approved the shedding to account", Wagner told a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College suspended the department, and the national department resigned from the local department.
This is how the US Federal Reserve's rate hike will affect the
Interest rates are rising and the stock market is in a slump, yields are rising and the economy is in recession.
We know that.
We don't know how long it will take or how long the effects will last.
In particular, in the economic sphere, we find historical evidence of timing.
The recession has come up to 11 months after the first interest rate hike and lasted up to 86 months.
The central bank often raises interest rates aggressively, but not always.
That is why central bank officials have already been keen to stress that investors should pay attention not to when the rate hike starts but to how long it takes for the situation to normalise.
There are, of course, a number of variables.
However, market participants may eventually find that any hype surrounding the rate increase may be exaggerated.
"The first central bank raise since the global financial crisis was no doubt often interpreted as a sign of the end of cheap money", Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics, told his clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect a gradual normalization of interest rates to a fairly low level.
But that doesn't mean there won't be repercussions.
Here are examples of how the effects can be seen across different sectors of the economy, based on historical trends:
As the market has seen for about a month, the prospect of interest rate increases may add to the volatility for some time.
When interest rates finally go up, the impact won't be as dramatic.
"The trend seems to be a 12-24 month stagnation in capital gains after the first rate hike, perhaps again reflecting a delay in monetary policy", said a Deutsche Bank analyst in a recent study on the impact of rate increases.
Over a 35-year period, the market usually sees a sharp rise of about 14 percent during the period of interest rate increases, a fairly steady 250 days afterwards (average increase of 2.6 percent), a normalization after 500 days, and an average yield of 14.4 percent after six stock trades, says Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management at Barron's.
According to Deutsch, the effect on equities usually intensifies at a slightly later stage in the cycle and interest rates start to decrease.
The recession is a fact of the economy, but rising interest rates usually do the trick.
In this case, if the central bank faces circumstances that did not exist before and could accelerate the downward trend.
The Commission has also taken into account the fact that the Bank has not yet taken any action to address the issue of the debt ceiling.
According to Deutsche Bank, only twice since 1950 have the 118 key interest rate hikes had a nominal rate below 4.5%.
While the second quarter of 2015 is forecast to be 3.6 percent, many did not expect it to be sustainable, and the third quarter is at 1.5 percent, reports the Atlanta Regional Reserve Bank.
The Commission's proposal to increase the rate of interest in the euro area is not a new development.
Market participants have been talking about raising the benchmark interest rate all year, and all eyes are now on this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends on Thursday.
Many strategists and economists believe that even if the open market committee approved the increase at this meeting, the futures trade only shows a 25% probability.
"In our studies from 1950 to the present, all upward cycles have been in a supercycle, with GDP falling before the downturn and rising very quickly after the upturn", the report says.
The recovery has been very slow compared to the worst recession in the history of the world.
The cycle is clearly the longest the central bank has been waiting for since the last recession, a record 35 months, now in its 74th month.
Fixed income securities have also been volatile when the market is predicting a rise in interest rates, and the pattern is also repeated on the capital side.
"The fundamental difference is that the effect is faster in bonds than in equities when the central bank changes the rate.
For bonds, yields appear to reverse immediately after the first up/down cycle.
At the end of the boom cycle, the returns immediately fall", Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that a rise in interest rates will bring long- and short-term bonds closer together and even out the curve.
"High-yield bonds often do better in this environment, even though we are still cautious about yields", said Kathy Jones, a fixed-income securities analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones says the market has already adjusted to the central bank's upcoming change of direction.
"In addition to the strengthening of the dollar and inflation forecasts, there are already several signs of adjustment to tightening fiscal policy", says Jones.
Short-term interest rates are rising, the yield curve is straight, credit risk margins have widened and volatility has increased, all characteristic of a market in which the central bank is tightening policy.
Broadly speaking, companies operating mainly in the US market benefit as interest rates fall and local products become attractive.
The outlook for indebted multinationals is worse, as a strengthening dollar drives their products up in global markets and their debt up.
"History shows that high-quality stocks are more profitable in the three months following a rate hike", Goldman Sachs analysts tell their clients.
Companies with a strong balance sheet outperformed companies with a weak balance sheet by an average of five percentage points after the interest rate hikes of 1994, 1999 and 2004.
The companies with high returns on capital and the low volatility stocks also fared better than the lower quality ones, on average by 4 and 3 percentage points respectively.
"Debt is a big issue.
Companies with a significant share of variable-rate debt are the biggest losers", Goldman said.
Outside the stock market, consumers also generally benefit from a strengthening dollar.
Savers also benefit from higher returns, although experts disagree on how quickly the effects will be felt.
MP Andrew Bingham: BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM
Conservative Andrew Bingham criticized the station for being too popular.
Bingham said that it is now difficult to distinguish the channel from its commercial competitors.
He also claims the BBC Music Awards are just a copy of the British gala.
MEP Damien Collins, for his part, has accused The Voice of being impersonal.
A prominent MP said BBC Radio 3 was gradually becoming a copy of Classic FM, adding to the pressure on the station to prove it was offering the same service as every other commercial station.
Conservative Andrew Bingham also told the BBC that the broadcaster's radio channel was becoming too populist and was no longer distinguishable from its commercial competitor.
"I don't want to talk about popularisation, but Radio 3 seems to be moving towards Classic FM", Bingham said.
Bingham also received criticism at the BBC Music Awards last December:
"Last year's BBC Music Awards, which were first held, look like a replica of the British Awards.
These two examples are examples of what is already on the market being copied rather than new and different", Bingham says.
The BBC's chief executive denied the allegations, saying that BBC Radio 3 had a significantly higher live music and educational content than its commercial competitor.
"I learned about classical music on Radio 3 in a way that I cannot learn from other channels.
The channel's commitment to live music and music making is in a class of its own.
I also think it is important that Radio 3 is also committed to finding new music and ordering new works", the CEO said.
Earlier this year, Alan Davey, director of BBC Radio 3, said that the station had to work harder to keep its audience interested because the British are more familiar with classical music.
However, Radio 3 is not the only BBC channel to be severely criticised for entering the commercial channels' territory, with a limited hearing by the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Tory MP Damien Collins has criticised The Voice, a talent competition the BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated £22m.
"The programme is not much discussed because it is not unique or particularly distinctive".
According to Lord Hall, the BBC1 show, with star judges Paloma Faith and Boy George, was produced for the BBC in a typical way.
Collins also urged the company to look for a hit show in its own barn the next time it launches a new entertainment series.
However, Collins did not rule out the possibility of continued subscriptions to The Voice or of taxpayers' money being used for other entertainment formats.
The slowest growth in online sales in August ever recorded, perhaps due to Black Friday
In the first months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
Online sales have been recorded since 2000, and last month saw the slowest growth in history.
E-commerce really picked up three years ago with the rise of mobile shopping.
Experts believe that Black Friday in November can curb shopping.
The decade-long conquest of online shopping has devastated many of Britain's shopping streets.
According to experts, there are signs that online shopping is levelling off and the new sales figures show only a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
August saw the slowest growth in total sales since the year 2000 when online sales were recorded, with an increase of only 5% last year.
According to experts, there are signs that online shopping is levelling off and the new sales figures show only a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
"If you compare last year's growth with the figures for 2000, it is clear that growth will flatten over time", IMRG editor-in-chief Andy Mulcahy told the Guardian.
Mulcahy said online shopping picked up momentum three years ago when consumers embraced mobile shopping.
"This made it possible for more people to shop online and for many to shop in a different environment, such as from a home sofa.
With mobile shopping now more moderate, growth may even out".
The Black Friday phenomenon originating in America is considered one of the reasons for the slowdown in growth.
Experts say that a theme day on the last Friday in November can make consumers delay their purchase decision before Black Friday.
Last year, five times the number of online shoppers than usual caused many retailers to shut down their websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which causes consumers to rush to buy, can curb buying during other times.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that a fair £1 for every £5 spent was spent online.
More than a third of certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, are purchased online.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in a fashion store.
Mecca is the burial place of the victims of the crane crash, the family of bin Laden, the responsibility of the victims.
Muslims carry the bodies of 29 victims through the streets as the first funerals are held in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia has said that the Saudi Binladin Group, a construction giant, is partly responsible for the accident.
The Ministry of Health also said that 394 people were injured when the elevator fell.
Bodies were carried high in the air as Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of a crane that fell on the Great Mosque of Mecca
Crowds of people dressed in white had gathered in the streets to bid farewell to the victims on their final journey to Al-Moaissem's cemetery.
The mourning procession passed a pilgrimage site where a downed construction truck had just the day before penetrated the roof of a mosque onto Muslims.
The King of Saudi Arabia is holding bin Laden's family construction company responsible for the crash that also injured 394 people.
The bodies of 29 victims of the crane accident at the Great Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead from the elevator collapse was Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, who had made his first pilgrimage to Mecca.
Akram had been at the Grand Mosque with his parents as they began their annual pilgrimage.
Saudi authorities have promised to organize the Hajj pilgrimage as thousands of people are currently arriving in the city for the pilgrimage.
According to King Salman, the Binladin Group should not have left the crane upside down when it was not in use.
According to an Arabic-language press release, the Binladin Group is partly responsible for the accident.
The English-language service of the news agency did not provide details, but the English-language press release said that the group's management was prohibited from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the elevator to collapse in the grounds of the Grand Mosque, where thousands of Muslims are heading for a Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
The Binladin Group has not published a notice on the crane accident and no representatives of the group have been contacted for comment.
The King also accused the group of not having complied with up-to-date safety regulations and of not having cooperated with meteorological experts.
Dozens of cranes surround the Great Mosque of Mecca as part of a giant construction project by the Binladin Group.
The bin Laden family has had close ties to the Saudi ruling family for decades and is responsible for several major construction projects.
The late Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was a renegade boy abandoned by his family in the 1990s.
The crane accident, which occurred in heavy rain and strong winds, occurred just days before the pilgrimage to Mecca, which every able-bodied Muslim is required to make at least once in his life.
Authorities say 158 people are still in hospital.
Authorities ordered a payment of one million rials (about $250,000) to the families of the victims and the permanently disabled.
The other injured in the accident will receive half of the compensation.
The B&Q boss says the problem is cheap Eastern European labour.
British people are hiring house-levels more often, says Veronique Laury.
The popularity of the service has been boosted by skilled, professional workers from Eastern Europe.
Over 200 new workers-only Screwfix stores are opening.
Meanwhile, Kingfisher is closing 60 B&Q stores across the country.
The Commission has not yet received any information on the situation in the country.
It is said that the British are handing over the hammering and painting jobs of the home to makers from Eastern Europe.
The skills of hammering and painting seem to be rare these days.
The head of the company behind B&Q says that more and more people in Britain now hire housekeepers to do household chores.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, a chain of home improvement stores, says that the phenomenon is caused by skilled workers from Eastern Europe who offer services at great prices.
As a result of the revelation, Kingfisher plans to open 200 new Screwfix stores for business customers, while 60 B&Q stores will be closed.
Laury needs more female employees in B&Q stores because eight out of 10 purchase decisions in the store are made by women.
At present, the majority of the staff are men.
Laurie says that it is important to be aware of population trends, since today more and more single women are also renovating their homes.
"Our store staff is still predominantly male", says Laury.
"We need to balance the situation.
Half our customers are women, and 80 percent of the purchasing decisions are made by women.
Women have a significant role to play in the decision-making process.'
Laury is one of five women to lead a British FTSE 100 company and has reorganised the company's management team to have equal numbers of women and men.
Kingfisher is almost unique in its category, with exactly 50% of its staff being women, including the CEO and CFO.
"This was a conscious decision, and diversity is an important issue for us", Laury said.
"It's not been difficult to find good women on the board".
Kingfisher's six-month operating profit and sales figures are down, despite the company's hard work after the store closures.
Kingfisher is responding to current trends: it owns the Screwfix and B&Q chains and plans to open 200 new stores.
The three-star government decided to resort to coercive legislation to save the country's economy.
It was a pretty quick time to get the effects.
The sharp head of the SAK and other workers' organizations was immediately forced to stand up and as a result the country stood on Friday in the face of a large demonstration by workers.
A lot of people think that makes sense.
We're asking if we should strike when things are bad enough.
They've even formed a resistance movement.
More than 50,000 people have already gone online to say they will not participate in the demonstration and will go to work.
In the good old days of consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no Internet to protest, but to openly declare yourself a rich man would have been political suicide for a small person.
The protest of a few tens of thousands of people from a union of millions of members is not a moment, but it is a cause for thought.
The position of the trade union movement is not as clear as it was 20 years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement, the values have changed.
From the point of view of the interest in Ay's activities, the government's drastic solutions can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
After years of seemingly unending negotiations, unions are finally getting to the point of defending workers' rights in a visible and appropriate way.
The government may thus wish to strengthen the role of the ay movement, when union membership is perhaps seen as more necessary than before.
Whatever one thinks of the actions of the organisations, it is nonsense that a demonstration on Friday would somehow stop Finland.
Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has been in decline for 31 consecutive months.
GDP continues to fall and unemployment is rising.
You'd think these things would be on everyone's mind.
University of Lappeenranta to make a big savings: target of 8.5 million savings, staff cut by 130
The Technical University of Lappeenranta is launching a cost-cutting programme aimed at reducing costs by a total of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the university will start staff-wide consultations with an annual savings target of €6.5 million.
In practice, this means a reduction of about 130 employees.
The other activities are also expected to save two million.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any comments from the Greek authorities on the measures taken by the Greek authorities to implement the restructuring plan.
The government's budget cuts also have an impact.
This fiscal year, the university is running a deficit of about $2.6 million.
The expenditure will increase slightly next year, but at the same time the funding from the Ministry will decrease by EUR 2 million and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The total budget of the University is about EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The combined effect of massive cuts in teaching and research and a reduction in corporate funding is very significant for our university", says Rector Anneli Pauli in a university press release.
Before the summer, the impact of the cuts appeared to be even more moderate, but now the reduction in supplementary funding is showing new proportions.
Negotiations with the trustees will begin next Tuesday and will last six weeks, as required by law.
Onnibus wants to join Finnish railways
The owner of the low-cost bus company Onnibus, Sir Brian Souter, a British citizen, tells YLE that the company also aims to provide rail services in Finland.
I'm very interested in joining the Finnish railway.
My company, Stagecoach, is one of the biggest railway companies in Britain, Souter says.
The railway sector is to be opened up to competition gradually.
The first is the metropolitan area in 2017-2018.
After the local traffic, the long-distance traffic.
Souter says he's already reached out to the Department of Transportation.
The Department of Transportation welcomes the Onnibus' plans, according to Yle.
Among other international companies, at least Transdev (formerly Veolia), which also operates bus services in Finland and rail services in the rest of Europe, has expressed an interest in rail transport.
The ECB shall report the interest rate rate on the ECB's balance sheet.
The world is watching the Fed's meeting on Wednesday and Thursday to decide on a possible rate hike for the first time in nearly a decade.
A fair half of economists who only last week believed the central bank would raise rates now believe the central bank will maintain its current rate of 0.25%, according to a Reuters survey of 80 economists.
"This is a historic situation, because the central bank has kept interest rates at zero for seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a major central bank can raise interest rates from zero and thus start to normalise interest rates", said Angel Ubide, senior researcher at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has been relatively good, with the recovery bringing in trillions of dollars in additional balance sheets and only a slight boost to inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore the global situation, which is not as rosy.
It has urged the market to prepare for change, but there are also signs to the contrary.
The decision is due to be published on Thursday at 8pm Central European time.
The shooter at Delta State University left a note apologizing .
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning before shooting a colleague later that day Shannon Lamb wrote a note apologizing for the first murder and hoping to undo it, authorities said Tuesday.
In Gautier , Mississippi , Lamb , a professor of geography and social sciences at Delta State University , called 911 about 10: 00 a.m.
Monday and told me he shot a man.
Lamb called 911 to ask for a 911 call to his home.
"I shot my wife last night", Lamb said, adding that there was a friendly dog in the house that was harmless to anyone but probably scared.
The police asked him his name, but he wouldn't tell them.
And Lamb didn't give us a motive for the shooting.
Police arrived at the scene and found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a note written by Lamb, which read: "I am very sorry and I hope I can undo what I did.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me".
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed history professor Ethan Schmidt before taking his own life late Monday when police caught up with him.
University president William LaForge said he was not aware of the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but noted that something was clearly bothering Lamb.
On Monday, it was reported that Lamb supposedly believed that Prentiss was also in a romantic relationship with Schmidt, but on Tuesday, authorities said there was no information or evidence of a threesome.
Shawn O'Steen, who was married to Prentiss for seven years, described his ex-wife as a good person.
The couple had been divorced for 15 years, but remained friends.
O'Steen told me that he and Prentiss have a 19-year-old daughter who's in shock.
He said the daughter and the mother were best friends.
According to the Sun Herald, Prentiss' close friend Lindsay Knowles told us that Prentiss was working online from home.
Knowles said Prentiss had been dating Lamb for about three years, and he also told her about her dog, Lightning.
"She was always willing to help others", Knowles said.
Police say Lamb called his family Monday night and told them he wasn't going to jail.
When police caught up with Lamb on Highway 1 near Greenville that evening, Lamb stopped the car, fled on foot, ran into the woods, and took his own life.
According to the university's website, Lamb received her doctorate in education from Delta State University in the spring of 2015.
The dim stars
The past few years have been difficult for the actor (pictured at left with his son Redmond).
In 2001, he battled leukemia, and in 2009, his longtime partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
The actor has also struggled with drugs, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
Everything that's happened has really taken its toll.
Manchester United 's Luke Shaw has been sidelined for months with two fractures .
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in a Manchester United Champions League match against PSV Eindhoven.
The defender will be forced to sit out for at least six months, but Louis van Gaal remains optimistic and believes Shaw will be back on the pitch this season.
Shaw, 20, was injured in the PSV defense in the 15th minute of the game after Héctor Moreno's poor tackle.
Shaw was in the field for nine minutes on first aid and needed oxygen before he could be taken to the hospital.
"Shaw has two broken legs and is in hospital", Van Gaal said.
Shaw is being transferred to Manchester for surgery tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.
The youngster, who joined Manchester United at 18, has been through a lot and is now injured after spectacular performances.
They were in the dressing room, giving Shaw oxygen.
He was crying.
I'm no doctor, but when he breaks his leg in two places, he's out for six months and he's not playing in the blocks.
I hope he's able to play again this season.
Moreno had little impact on the score when the situation was not followed by a red card and a penalty.
The referee of the match, Nicola Rizzoli, did not punish the Mexican player.
Van Gaal says the Italian referee made a mistake.
"You can judge for yourself, but I think the situation was worth the penalty kick and the red card.
It was a two-legged, unrestrained tackle".
Shaw tweeted, "Thank you all for your messages, I can't describe how devastated I am, my recovery starts here, and I will come back stronger".

The England defender has a special reason to recover to compete in the European Championships in France in June.
"This is a very bad injury", said the PSV coach.
"In these types of injuries, all parties are always very sorry.
The intention of the players is never to harm the opponent".
Moreno didn't break his leg playing for Mexico until the 2014 World Cup, when Van Gaal was in charge of the Netherlands.
"He is very sorry because he did not mean to harm his opponent.
"I didn't see it myself.
I just saw the ball going the other way, so it looked like he (Moreno) touched the ball, but I didn't see Luke's tackle".
"I know how it feels, I know how difficult a situation like this can be", Moreno told SBS6.
"I feel really bad. I'm really sorry".
PSV's Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after a collision with Chris Smalling.
David Cameron should know the Lorax better than you do.
Every parent will soon find that a child learns almost by heart his favorite book.
Except for seeing you with David Cameron.
When asked by the Children's Holiday Foundation to name his favorite children's book, Cameron chose The Lorax, a 1971 environmental story by Dr. Seuss.
In a post on SuperCamp's website, Cameron writes that the choice was difficult. "The story is funny, touching, creative, and has a powerful message, and I love reading it to my kids because there's always an image or message that we haven't noticed before".
Sounds good, except the next section where Cameron is supposed to describe the plot of the book is a summary of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to complement the shorter opening credits.
"In a city of need, where real trees and plants have disappeared and even air is a commodity, there lives a boy named Ted who wants to get into the heart of his dream girl Audrey by fulfilling his greatest dream: to see a real tree", the text reads.
If this is not suspicious enough, Cameron's text is partially consistent with the plot summary of the Lorax movie on the Internet Movie Database website, which begins: "In a town of need, where everything is artificial and even air is a commodity, there lives a boy named Ted who wants to get into the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey".
Cameron is known as an active parent, so it seems unlikely that the plot of the book would be so alien to him.
It's likely that a low-level PR job like this has been entrusted to an assistant, apparently someone who hasn't read The Lorax 20 times in a row as a child.
The Prime Minister's spokesman said the text was likely from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps declined to comment further but confirmed that the text was handwritten by Cameron's staff.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being left out of the England squad, but it's still tough.
Facing Pakistan in the UAE is a tough task, but after seeing the last 3-0 Test series defeat of the England team on tour, it is not to be expected.
I wouldn't rule out a guest win.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the team three years ago, but the batting lineup has good players and the attitude of the team is strong. They have no bad experience from 2012, just youthful positivity.
As a footballer, Moeen Ali develops into a striker, and Adil Rashid, although he has no Test-level experience, represents an attacking option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from England 's Test team and replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to dismiss Adam Lyth is obviously hard for me to understand as his head coach at Yorkshire.
His seven Tests have been two good attacks against challenging conditions, and the simple and cruel truth is that cricketers are judged by their results.
For example, Joe Root is not a questionable choice because, as I said before, players are the best selectors.
A few 50-point games would have been a great team for Lyth, but his fate was in his own hands.
I hope he gets another chance when he hits more runs for Yorkshire.
England's head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when he wasn't doing as well as he could have, which doesn't surprise me.
The question of how long the Test batsmen will have the chance to make an impact is a difficult one.
Lyth had seven home runs, as did his predecessor Sam Robson, while Nick Compton had nine.
Compton was the only one who got a chance to play both home and away.
The only complaint is perhaps that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean when Lyth was at its peak, but this missed opportunity is now history.
Alex Hales is coming into the team, and he's a hitter that I respect very much.
He's a cricketer of unknown origin, as we saw in Yorkshire earlier this season when he scored 236 against us at Trent Bridge.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but of course this depends on the composition of the UAE team.
There's been a suggestion that Moe starts the batting with Cook, which would get an extra pitcher in the game while keeping four fast bowlers, and I'm not against that.
I see no reason why a top-order batsman should be batting here, and this left-hander has already proven himself to be a great cricketer.
Moeen may not have achieved much with his local team in Worcestershire, but he's been a third baseman for the team, and that's not a big difference.
My former teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 Tests as a first-class substitute before making his debut in 2001.
He scored 300 points in one go, and there was no turning back.
Zafar Ansari is the team's starting quarterback, and from what I've seen of him, he's proven to be a very impressive young man.
People can look at his stats -- he averaged 31 points as a batter and 35 as a pitcher -- and this could be a shot, but a lot of pitchers haven't shown they're ready, and the selectors decided to take a young player.
He's gonna learn a lot on this match trip.
Outside the playing team, England seem to have made some smart choices in their coaching staff.
The appointment of Sri Lankan batsman Mahela Jayawardene as a Test match advisor could be a breakthrough.
This is one of the kindest men in the game, who brings a lot of experience, because he's played in all kinds of conditions and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes to the white ball section of the game, bringing with him both energy and ruthlessness.
I think he has always seemed to fit in with international cricket, whether in his role as a player or a coach, and like Mahela, he has a mind to work with.
Sometimes a new voice in the locker room, even if it says the same thing as the one before, can be a stimulant.
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Even if everyone disagrees, coaches and selectors don't dictate the schedule.
And we must remember that like the players, their jobs depend on the results.
These are never decisions that are made without thinking.
The Brexit camp may win if the economy is in a bad shape in 2017
David Cameron's half-way negotiated strategy for Britain to remain in the EU is sinking deeper and deeper every day, even without the pleasing Jeremy Corbyn's "yes or no" election to the leadership of the Labour Party or the TUC's mocking of Europe on Tuesday.
Other countries have their Corbyns and Nigel Farage.
A European diplomat recently explained how the EU is involved in many crises, although not all of them are its own doing.
The annual congress of the TUC in Brighton decided that they too would not like the EU if it undermined social security.
We could call it, like, Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The prime minister and chancellor hang out at summits and bilateral talks in different capitals, take pictures of themselves in front of famous monuments, with or without high-ranking officials, return home and claim to have allies for reform.
It's all about me.
To my European friend who wants a Britain with a broad-minded view within the EU tent. 'Don't leave us alone with France', says Berlin, suggesting that a growing number of short-sighted ministers and officials in different capitals have reached a point where they no longer care whether we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, Germany's sensible Chancellor, is an ally but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave before it goes bad, as happened to those who stayed too long: Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
François Holland of France will be re-elected or will be elected in 2017.
His power is also waning.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, and Spain a left-wing government.
It is hard to imagine them rushing to help the self-absorbed Britons who could better use their energy to try to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom.
Some of these ministers may be planning to deliberately make useless comments in the style of the Scottish National Party in the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
The negotiations were arranged, and Britain had no control over the negotiations.
Europeans know how the British press preys and how the EU-skeptic oligarchic press is, just like Tony Benn's 1975 referendum, which was 2:1 in favour of joining the EU in 1973.
Some of you may remember Boris Johnson, the European opportunist who became known as our "EU banana-straight correspondent" in Brussels in the early 1990s.
At least Ed Miliband knew his enemy.
These include tax evaders, phone hackers and the pretend temporary residents who own most of our good newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought pretty much the same thing about them, but then he realized that when you're in a cage with a rough gorilla, you have to hand out bananas as a decoy so the gorilla doesn't eat you for lunch and dinner.
Miliband was also a Blairite strongman in his opposition to the referendum, after Blair conceded to the EU constitution, which was then rejected.
And the press never forgave him for that.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn who kindly patted me on the back in Westminster on Monday, I told him he had no more time to waste on me, there was a risk that he would adopt the media boycott strategy of Neil Kinnock from the 1980s, which was a mistake and still is.
It may take time, but Corbyn must develop a coherent strategy for dealing with the media, not me, but Andrew Marr, whose BBC couch he sat on on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what we politely call constructive.
He says he wants to keep us in a reformed EU.
Most people outside the Ukip and Tory groups can probably answer this in the affirmative.
That's what Hilary "Benn but not Bennett" Benn said on radio and television this week, when her inner boy scout tried to deny that it was a bad move by Corbyn to appoint the tough John McDonnell as shadow Treasury secretary.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his old father had difficulty being disloyal to his Labour colleagues on television without going too far and losing his seat in the House of Commons.
Hilary's problems were more interesting.
The report also calls for the EU to be able to take on board the EU's nuclear programme and to take on board the EU's nuclear programme.
Corbyn's desire to care, however admirable the image, must be remembered that he touched even me.
Mr Cameron does not need to be given a free pass on the EU to take Labour's support for the referendum for granted, as Mr McDonnell has said.
At least that's what Simon Jenkins thinks.
McDonnell and Corbyn's echo of EU membership is a perfect fit for the blockade economy and the anti-capitalist past: the debate is no longer confined to a narrow circle of left-wing dissidents, for whom the idea of similarity is a central tenet in doctrinal disputes.
The echo chamber has also been seen in NATO, Tom Watson is adamant that Corbyn will not campaign for leaving, and foreign diplomats are forced to try to clarify this at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital, they have a sceptical electorate, why should they make concessions to Britain when all else may be for nothing?
The United States is already quite disappointed in the British military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even the cuts made by the Tory government, which I was reminded of on Monday at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize UK government statements on e-cigarettes
According to the researchers, the claims of the state-funded institute that e-cigarettes are 95 percent less harmful than traditional smoking originated at a meeting in which 12 participants had ties to the tobacco industry.
Experts in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and the Lancet Medical Journal criticized the evidence presented in a report on e-cigarettes by Public Health England (PHE), a public health authority.
PHE described its report published last month as "a revolutionary and comprehensive review of the results".
However, several researchers have questioned the reliability of the data and pointed to the links of some experts to the tobacco industry.
Last month, an editorial in the Lancet Medical Journal took on the "remarkably cheap base" for the PHE's most important conclusion on teeth.
In addition, two researchers in the BMJ have considered whether the claims are based on "rock or sand".
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, have stated: "The basic premise of public health is that policies are based on clear evidence of their effectiveness".
According to McKeen and Capewell, the general public assumes that PHE's claim that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95 percent less harmful than conventional cigarettes" should be based on detailed analysis and modeling of research results.
The claim stems from a meeting of 12 people convened to develop a model based on a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to unify participants' views on the harm of nicotine products.
According to McKeen and Capewell, the meeting was supported by EuroSwiss Health, whose previous independent research by its CEO was funded by British American Tobacco (BAT), according to sources.
The Commission also noted that the management of the BAT project was not in line with the objectives of the BAT.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting granted financing from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but, after previously claiming financing from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, the participant did not.
The selection criteria for the panel were not clarified, but included a number of well-known supporters of e-cigarettes, some of whom admitted to being involved as industry funders.
However, some participants are not known for their expertise in the field of tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the tobacco officer of PHE.
According to McKeen and Capewell, the Group's study report shows that there is no incontrovertible evidence of harmfulness for a large number of products and their compliance with the criteria.
However, no links or deficiencies are mentioned in the PHE report.
The PHE report states that so far no evidence has been presented that e-cigarettes can promote smoking in children or non-smokers.
According to PHE's Director of Health and Wellbeing, Professor Kevin Fenton, the allegations have been answered before.
Fenton says e-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than traditional smoking.
One in two people who smoke in their lifetime will die from tobacco addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are lower than those of conventional tobacco, but the long-term effects need to be studied further.
The PHE has a duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not, especially in a situation where the relative dangers compared to conventional tobacco are unclear.
In the United Kingdom, there are nearly 80 000 smoking-related deaths each year and the cost to public health is £2 billion a year.
Responsible action requires that we present clearly the current evidence that e-cigarettes are not a risk-free alternative, but that their harmful effects are a fraction of those of traditional tobacco.
The BBC should give up EastEnders, says Channel 4 boss
Luke Johnson, former head of Channel 4, has said that the BBC should stop broadcasting certain programmes, including EastEnders and The Voice, and that commercial competitors would give up their right to hit shows such as Albert Square.
Johnson said that the licence fee should be used only for programmes that other television stations do not make.
He criticised the BBC for presenting programmes likely to reach a smaller audience at the same time as the programmes of its competitors with large audiences, and for example on BBC4.
After the BBC's chief executive Tony Hall announced that the company wanted to increase cooperation with other organisations, Johnson said he had been trying for six years to get Channel 4 to work with the BBC, without success.
"I do not agree with the idea that the BBC should buy formats and broadcast programmes that would clearly be part of a competing channel's programme", Johnson told the House of Commons Communications Committee, which was examining the BBC's future.
If the BBC wants to keep its broadcasting licence, which I think is not necessarily a good idea in the medium or long term, it should at least limit its offer to programmes which are not produced and bought by others.
The BBC is broadcasting The Voice at the best possible time because it wants the widest possible support for the future.
If no other channel is doing the show, it's clearly ridiculous nonsense.
"I don't see why a regressive tax should fund programmes that could be funded without subsidies", Johnson said.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders is another, even though it's a production of its own.
A lot of networks would give their right hand for that.
I don't see how this serves the broadcaster's service offering.
I don't think these would be losses for the BBC".
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, believes the BBC is in need of good viewership because it has ambitious people working for it and because they believe it is the best way to ensure long-term support.
Johnson's comments on the BBC's most popular shows are in line with former Sky boss Tony Ball, who suggested in his MacTaggart lecture in 2003 that the BBC should sell out shows like EastEnders.
According to Johnson, the BBC's niche programming is shown on BBC4, where viewership is usually unmeasurable, but the programming serves its purpose. "The BBC can say that in defending its hypocritical mission of paying £4 billion for special programmes that nobody watched".
"The BBC shows them at times when no one ever sees them".
Regarding public radio fees, Johnson said: "I challenge you to find another system, one that is as old-fashioned in the sense of who gets the best out of it.
Of course, everyone thinks £150 a year is cheap, but people for whom it is a lot of money, especially if they don't watch the BBC very much".
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief executive David Elstein, who also shared his views with the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should change its old mission to "inform, educate and entertain".
Elstein said that the BBC's current offer of educational programmes is barely 1 percent on television and 0.1 percent on radio, adding that the BBC should learn from Australian and Canadian broadcasters and embrace a new faith in its mission: "to inform, enlighten and entertain".
On the question of cooperation, Elstein suggests that the BBC could add broadcasts of events such as the Proms, where only a fraction of concerts were broadcast last year.
Brain cells can be controlled by sound waves using sonogenetics .
This video shows how the shuttle worm changes direction when it is exposed to ultrasound.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically engineered nervous systems that can be controlled with ultrasound.
The small shuttle-like craft change direction when they are directed at ultrasound at frequencies above the range of human hearing.
Sound waves activate motor neurons that have been genetically engineered to have a transport membrane that responds to ultrasound.
See also: Scientists monitor brain activity with light
The researchers say that the worms were able to demonstrate the efficacy of a new technique called sonogenetics, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart, and muscle cells with an external stimulus.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the technique could one day replace deep brain stimulation (DBS), an invasive technique used to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease in which the brain is stimulated by electrical impulses.
Shuttle worms do not normally respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that worms do when they are placed in a liquid with microscopic bubbles.
Chalasani says the bubbles amplify the ultrasonic waves that travel inside the worms.
The enhanced ultrasound waves affect TRP4 ion channels in some of the cell membranes of worms.
According to an article in the journal Nature Communications, sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate the cells to which they are attached.
To control the shuttle worms with ultrasound, Chalasani genetically modified the worms to produce TRP4 ion channels in some of the nerves that control their movement.
When ultrasound was directed to the modified worms, the microbubbles amplified the sound waves and passed them to the worms, setting off a signal in the nerve cell.
The method is somewhat similar to optogenetics, a revolutionary tool that allows researchers to activate nerve cells with light.
However, according to Chalasan, sonogenetics has certain advantages over optogenetics.
Light is directed to the brain by light fibers, but low-frequency ultrasound can easily pass through the cell and be directed through the skull to the brain.
"We believe that gene therapy and viral therapy can temporarily expose human nerve cells to ultrasound in the clinical setting for certain neurological treatments", Chalasani said.
The researcher says that the method could also be used in muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture devices at your door!
The ads are a disgrace to the British arms trade.
Watch the video of the Amnesty International anti-arms rally.
The Karmic Killer Missiles!
The ankle-breaking footcarriages!
Grape bombs!
Remote controls that cause excruciating pain but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and cartoons clearly reveal that the advertisement in question is a parody of the world's largest arms fair.The video, produced by Amnesty International, is designed to highlight the British government's efforts to sell arms to repressive governments at the DSEI (Defence Security and Equipment International) exhibition, which is being held at the ExCel Exhibition Centre in London's Docklands.
More on DSEI: Authoritarian governments arrive in London
Bus stops and subway cars are also littered with posters that demand a second look.
"Important announcement: are you travelling on the 15th of September?" The sign looks like the London Underground's signage.
"In September, a group of arms dealers will arrive in the Docklands, asking customers to help with the elimination of the arms embargo".
Three hundred posters were created by artists whose work was exhibited at Banksy Dismaland's Museum of Cruel Designs.
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped distribute the posters around London with a £6 "ad space hacking kit" containing six-inch keys that allegedly access about a third of the world's bus stop billboards.
Transport for London is not laughing at the vandalism of the posters.
One of the spoof ads for the Special Patrol Group collective.
Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, says artists are beginning to question things and want to bring their political work outside the gallery to the public.
Artists have found that social impact through art requires bringing art into the real world, and many have moved to work with protest activists.
Another anti-gun poster greets public transportation users on the subway.
The video has been viewed over 100,000 times on Facebook in 24 hours, and was designed by the advertising agency VCCP, without any remuneration, and both the graphic designer and narrator have also done their work without remuneration.
Matt Lever, artistic director of the VCCP, was puzzled by the absence of trade fair advertising and the empty space in Excel's event calendar, saying, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid".
They tried to make a more realistic, shady corporate video, but the bright colors and animation are more eye-catching".
"They have done a wonderful job helping us to highlight the fairs that are involved in the illegal trade in torture equipment", says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
"Now the government must act to ensure that no instruments of torture are illegally traded right on our doorstep".
Perhaps the most creative aspect of the gun show is the ExCeL showroom itself, where exhibitors use the most exotic expressions of their merchandise.
In its press release, Saab announced an order for the US Army for 'the portable AT4CS RS'.
The product includes a "specialised warhead that penetrates directly into the target".
That doesn't sound very pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in student housing
I moved into my dorm 11 years ago, and I was an innocent 19-year-old, still believing in barets and moral relativism, and only now do I remember the violent smiles of those I irritated and the countless, long complaints of others.
I can summarize the most important lessons in eight simple rules.
Moving into a new apartment is a mildly stressful experience at best and a shocking one at worst.
It is easy to start gossiping: you tell everyone where you are from, whether you took a break and why, what you like about Corbyn and why you don't "really hate or love Marmite because it's just a whiz, haha, I'm in my room".
Take a breath now and then.
And help others to breathe, by showing interest and asking other things.
Asking questions will drive conversation and help you find people you like and people you wouldn't talk to even if your eyelashes were on fire and these people were sharing fire extinguishers.
Give the others some room.
Private rooms often serve as drinking establishments, movie theaters, and general living spaces, but private rooms are also places where people dress, starting with their underwear.
See also: Don't even think about mixing dating and college
College is a tough place for introverts.
Your room should be a place to relax, but in many dormitories, a social culture is formed where you wander from room to room and form lifelong friendships.
This culture can be a nightmare for a person who longs for a place to return to.
In this environment, it is not possible to say, "I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I want you to leave so that I can recharge the energy I used to spend dating you".
Try to see if any of your classmates are tired of social interaction, perhaps instead of knocking at the door, you should text.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
There was this guy in my dorm who thought an unlocked door meant he was welcome in.
He saw things.
Make friends by baking.
You start your studies conveniently when baking is in, so if you're baking brownies and knocking on someone's door, you don't look like a 50s, a little bit weird case of, "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you a little something.
Homemade treats are a great way to make new friends.
Your classmates are bound to talk to you, and a tasty surprise can leave a positive impression on them.
Of course, this will require you to have reasonable baking skills.
If you serve unfortunate cakes made with flour, sugar, and fat, others will probably pretend to be asleep when you knock on the door.
Food spoilage is also a common offense in student dormitories.
Of course, taking another chicken is stealing, but can one's tea spill a drop of milk from another's can?
Always check with the owner of the milk can.
You're probably gonna get it, even if the milk quote would make the owner of the can giggle.
I understand that it is annoying when someone tells you something, but try to handle it as adultly as possible, unlike my own schoolmate who spilled detergent in her milk as punishment for milk thieves.
She's in prison now.
Don't make a lot of noise when people are trying to sleep or pee.
Not only is it polite, but it's also worth remembering that every other hole you dig...
In my dorm room, a girl asked the person next door to turn down the music because it was three o'clock in the morning and she had an exam.
The neighbor just raised the volume.
When I finally got quiet in the next room, she let the neighbor sleep for two hours, then she went to the exam for three hours, left the music in her room, and locked the door.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same dorm?
And wouldn't it be strange if you first thought your college roommate was your future spouse, started dating, broke up, and had to see him every day and lose the right to see your mutual friends?
Of course, your heart wants what it wants, but if your college boyfriend is definitely not the one, try to control your urges.
If you find out in a moment of desperation that someone has left his key in a room with an unlocked door, the line between prank and bullying is more blurred than you might think.
A good joke is fun, but one that you recover from in an instant.
Hiding an object can be a valuable and fun lesson, but no one should mess up their room with toothpaste and shampoo.
You can lock the door to the other room and drop the keys into a glass of water that you put in the freezer, but do not fasten anyone's belongings to the ceiling with a blue plaster more than a couple of times.
A racist attack on a hostel for foreign students in Kite - a house designed as a reception centre was dusty in Salo
A racist attack was carried out on the hostel of foreign students in Kite in North Karelia on Saturday morning.
Contrary to what the police had previously said, the accommodation is not for minors seeking asylum but for foreign students who have been in Finland for a longer period of time, says Heidi Luukkainen, a teacher at the Kitee Evangelical Folk School.
The windows and walls of the dormitories of the National University were painted with racist signs, such as swastikas, and a metal object was thrown through the window of one of the dormitories, reports the police in Eastern Finland.
According to Luukkainen, who teaches social security education to young people at the National University, there were about ten people in the building at the time of the attack.
"It was a weekend and adults are free to move around, so some of them might have been elsewhere", says Luukkainen.
The People's University has people from 12 different nationalities.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time and recently arrived minor asylum seekers.
Everyone who was in the messed-up building has an A-rat.
Some are in primary school, some are in vocational studies and some are studying Finnish", says Luukkainen.
A-status is a so-called permanent residence permit, which can be issued for four years at a time to a foreigner who has already been in Finland for some time.
The police in Eastern Finland are investigating the attack as a misdemeanor and a violation of the peace.
According to Luukkainen, a press conference was held on Monday for the students, with the necessary interpreters present.
There's no panic here, and no one's wanted to leave.
We have had foreign students for twenty years, and this is the first time that something like this has happened", says Luukkainen.
According to Luukkaine, the mess has already been cleaned out of the walls.
The suspects were at least three men, and they were driving a white car.
I think this is a youth weekend headline, now that this subject has come up.
Nothing more serious than that", says Luukkainen.
Saló also has a hospital, which has been designed as a reception center.
It happened last week.
MTV reported on the website Tuesday night.
The wall of the hospital had a swastika and the words "You are not welcome" written in English.
It's been reported to the police.
Corrected on 15th September at 16:02 for incorrect information provided by the police regarding the age and status of the people living in the building.
The government is shutting down the Y train to Karelia. Passengers are in their tracks.
The Y-train running from Helsinki to Raaseporin Karja will stop running in March.
The news angered passengers on the first shift of the train at Helsinki's main railway station.
The people of Siuni are particularly affected by the drought, said Torbjörn Bengtström, a resident of the municipality.
It is a very stupid thing to do, because the population is growing all the time and people who go to work need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can't be down to anything but political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says in the HSTV interview video that he will come to the capital by tractor.
There are also changes in trains in other parts of the Netherlands.
The H and R trains running on the terminus will be combined to form a new R line.
The Purola station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna in Tuusla will be decommissioned.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications and the VR on Tuesday published information on the routes for which the Ministry will purchase rail transport for the next contract period.
The contract period changes every year and there are routes to be cancelled throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement, to be finalised in the autumn, will be adopted by the Monetary Committee at a later date.
Bengtström from the Dionysian region considers that the State's train-cutting operation is short-sighted.
We make the same mistakes that have been made before and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then it's time for a little remorse.
The Y-train is also used by people other than the people of Raasepor and Siuni, as it is fast and bypasses several stations.
Annina Pöyrö from Espoo was saddened by the fate of those who traveled farther from the city by train.
"It's especially bad for people who have to re-plan their trip", he said, lamenting the Y train.
I'm sure you'll be a little relieved.
A new train connection is likely to be built to the coastline, replacing the Y-train in the Helsinki Region Transport Area (HSL), which will take you to Kirkkonum.
This adds to the costs for HSL, which in practice is the local authorities of the region and their taxpayers.
"We are now starting to investigate the different options and their impact on service levels and ticket prices", said HSL CEO Suvi Rihtniemi.
It is not yet possible to estimate the exact costs.
Rihtniemi says that based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid approximately EUR 1 million per year for the Y-train, although the Ministry has paid much more.
The R line coming up the end of the line will miss two stations.
Instead, the number of train journeys in Ainola and Saunakalli will double.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes stop throughout the country.
The Ministry will no longer purchase train services on the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The Beating-Joensuu route is shortened to Beating-Theft route.
The train frequency will be reduced on the routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka port and Kajaani-Oulu.
The total number of journeys made by the terminated shifts is over half a million a year, while the total number of journeys purchased by the Ministry is about nine million.
The new agreement is intended to bring the State savings of 12.3 million a year.
The contract is worth approximately EUR 27,5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in his book, The Current State of Capital, entitled "Marx is a Person to Be Familiar With".
The world economic crises have brought Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his major work Capital, published between 1867 and 1894, to the fore, writes former SKP chairman Yrjö Hakanen in his book, The Current Situation of Marx's Capital, published today.
"He is now taken more seriously than in a long time", Hakanen writes in his foreword.
Marx's predictions of the development, internationalization and ever-widening penetration of the capitalist economy into all spheres of life, the concentration of capital and the growing role of money and imaginary capital have proved astonishingly far-sighted.
The author of the book, based on the Capital Seminars organised by Hakasen, is also Professor Sixten Korkman, a respected economist at Aalto University.
In his book, Korkman writes that Marx is relevant "now and forever".
But the former director of the Institute of Industrial Research and the Industrial Delegation is not a Marxist, is he?
No, not at all.
Korkman says by telephone that he does not consider Marx a contemporary economic thinker but rather an interesting social theorist.
Today, the social sciences have become differentiated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator, and literary connoisseur.
"The common perception is that ideological history tells of the wrong opinions of dead men", Korkman begins.
It's true that Marx's predictions were badly wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew conclusions that were too far-fetched from the beginnings of capitalism, Korkman argues.
But Korkman sees value in Marx's radical stance.
"What is more relevant about Marx is that he asked good questions", he says.
Now we're back to discussing Marx's interests in wealth distribution.
"Marx may be an inspiration to anyone who wants to understand the big picture, the changing world of the technological revolution", Korkman analyzes.
But in what the government is expected to decide tomorrow, Marx will not help.
I mean, he thought capitalism was a hopeless case that should just stop.
Still, Korkman thinks it's worthwhile getting to know Marx.
"In the '70s, Marx was impossible to read", says Korkman.
"The Maoists and the Trotskyites and the other sects all hated capitalism, but each hated the other even more".
Today, the debate is more diverse and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political weight of the past.
"Every social scientist should be familiar with Marx's world of thought - as with other classics", says Korkman.
UN calls for war criminals to be brought to justice in Sri Lanka
The UN is calling for the establishment of a special court to investigate war crimes committed during the Sri Lankan civil war, AFP news agency reports.
The UN report on the civil war between 1983 and 2009 was released on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report blames war crimes on both the Sri Lankan military and the rebels known as Tamil Tigers.
The Sri Lankan civil war is estimated to have killed at least 100,000 people.
The exact number of casualties is also unknown.
The UN report calls for a thorough investigation into the major military offensive in the final months of a long war in 2009.
The report blames the Sri Lankan armed forces for torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, which were as likely to be suffered by men as women.
The report says the rebels are guilty of forcing bystanders and children to fight.
The report says both sides are guilty of murder.
Sri Lanka responded on Wednesday that it would conduct its own investigation but would not allow the establishment of a UN court because of foreign judges.
In England , they gave you a yo-yo test and you had to check your social media .
The autumn student papers were on Wednesdays in a long foreign language, the majority of which was English.
Over 16,000 people tested their English skills.
You could write a paper on social media.
Based on my own experience, I had to ask myself if social media makes us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, an article of 150-250 words in English could be pointed to the owner of the advice column on the website.
It was titled Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt is in charge of Lelia's Finnish lounge chair.
She had to ask for advice on how to get parents to view things from the perspective of the young ones.
There were four subjects in total, one of which had to be chosen.
"It was the hardest of them all", says Mia Lybeck, an English instructor at the third Swedish-language high school in Porvoo.
The third topic was merely a quote from former European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso.
And the fourth subject, Lybeck said, was pretty cool.
I had to write a speech on why companies should hire young people.
"At least our school has a speech-writing program", says Lybeck, who rates the whole experiment as "fairly normal".
The Finnish or Swedish test was conducted in English, and asked questions about texts that, for example, addressed the adaptation of the summer squid to climate change and the processing of large amounts of data.
On Wednesday, some long Russian (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written.
The autumn tests will continue on Friday, when the next test will be held in Sweden or Finland.
In high schools, the test is administered as normal, so it is not affected by the attitude of the employees.
The University Graduate Council urges students to find suitable transportation in time to make it to the test.
An additional period may be granted if it can be shown that the delay was not due to personal negligence.
A shop was robbed at gunpoint in Oulu .
In Oulu, a shop in the Kellon district was robbed on Wednesday morning.
Police said the robber was wearing dark clothes and a commando uniform that covered his face.
He's a normal-sized man in his 30s.
Police say the man threatened staff with a small weapon and was given a small amount of cash as a bounty.
They're investigating it as a grand theft.
Police are preparing for tens of thousands of demonstrators arriving in Helsinki with support patrols from elsewhere in Finland.
A protest against the government's cuts will blockade Helsinki city centre on Friday, police predict.
According to preliminary reports, tens of thousands of people may be expected.
The members of the SAC, AKA and STTK associations will meet at the Railway Gate at 11 a.m.
Police are also believed to be involved in the demonstration.
The police on duty are responsible not only for alerting and policing but also for ensuring that the giant show goes on.
The roads leading to the railway terminal will be closed to motor vehicles from approximately 9:30 to 14:00.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed in the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is cut off at the Kaisaniemi traffic circle, from the west direction starting from the Mannerheiminte.
Captain Seppo Kujala, is the Helsinki police station manned enough?
At least for now, it looks like we've had enough.
I'm not taking sides on police labor struggles.
The European Union has a responsibility to ensure that the EU's nuclear safety policy is implemented in a timely manner.
Police won't give us the exact patrol numbers.
"Some are coming, but as a rule we will manage on our own", says Kujala.
Police are advising people to avoid private vehicles in central Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates the worst traffic jam will extend from Hakaniemi level to the core.
Traffic will be at a standstill from dawn to dusk.
The arrival of protesters from other parts of Finland is accompanied by a large number of buses.
They won't be allowed into the Iron Gate.
Buses are usually a little far away.
The rest of the journey then involves walking to the protest site", says Kujala.
The demonstration will also stop public transport in Helsinki.
From a police point of view, there's a silver lining.
The issue of the smoothness of public transport, which is normally at hand at these large crowds, is now partly taken care of by itself.
The organizers of the demonstration have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of the government's economic policies may come to Helsinki.
Police expect the demonstration to go smoothly.
They're ordinary people, working or unemployed, ordinary citizens.
Finns are reasonable and peaceful people", says Kujala.
Local demonstrations will also be held on Friday throughout Finland.
The Friday demonstration is extraordinary in many ways. Remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The large demonstration organized by the trade unions on Friday is in many ways interesting and extraordinary.
For example, there is no good comparison in Finnish political history, says Martti Siisiäinen, professor emeritus of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
No wonder the ay movement protested.
If it did not, it would raise its hands to the government, says Sieskeinen.
The far-right government has struck at the core of the Finnish corporatist tradition - and also at points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's tight grip on contract law is a failure.
There are many features here that really try to bring the ay-motion to its knees.
And the ay movement has a place to look in the mirror.
The mirror is needed, for example, because the ay movement does not have the support of all employees for Friday demonstrations.
What is new is the sharp division that the demonstration will create among those who the ay movement would like to join the demonstration.
The unemployed from all over Finland demonstrated in Parliament in November 1993.
If you look for a Friday protest to compare it to, it could be the giant unemployment rally, the 1993 Murrostorstai, says Siisiäinen.
In the midst of the Great Depression, the organized Brutal Thursday brought together 20,000 unemployed.
The Esko Ahon (centre) government stumbled from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that relations between the Finnish government and wage-earning organizations had never been so bad as during the bourgeois rule of Ahon.
Now the government and the ay movement are perhaps even worse than in the days of Murrostorstein.
Besides, the most bourgeois government in Finland is now in power, says Siisiäinen.
The current coalition is still interesting in that it is so far to the right, despite what the fundamentalists say.
Even in the days of the Jüttik, there were certain elements of the old workers' movement.
Several thousand protesters are expected to attend on Friday.
The demonstration will also stop public transport and possibly close daycare centers and schools.
Although the protest may not receive unshakeable support from the salaried, it may become the largest in years.
In recent years, about 300 demonstrations have been held in Helsinki every year.
They're all over the place.
Traditionally, the Finnish ay movement's demonstrations have been quite peaceful - although the methods have become more severe in recent years.
Traditionally, in Finnish demonstrations, conflict is avoided, and law is obeyed.
The protesters try to avoid damaging or destroying property, says Siisiäinen.
The late 1990s, however, brought a new wind.
The culture of protest has changed.
The EU membership made farmers nervous to throw eggs and the police prepared to get pig shit on them.
In 1998, the firefighters went on strike for three months.
There were also striking demonstrations by pilots and air traffic controllers, among others.
Remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Strikes in the 1970s
The most important strikes of the 1970s were the metal strike of 1971 and the power plant and electricity strike of 1977.
The metal bands' strike was attended by 70,000 metal bands.
The strike was suspended at the suggestion of the Conciliation Board after seven weeks.
The metal workers got a 16% raise.
In the spring of 1977, a 49-day power strike caused blackouts across the country.
The first was in 1993
On 4 November 1993, some 20,000 people, many of them unemployed, gathered in front of the Houses of Parliament to express their support for work.
Firefighters went on strike for three months in ' 98 .
The firefighters' strike was one of the longest in the 1990s, if not the longest in the nation.
Farmers protested against the EU in 1994 and 1999
The police were caught in the act of chicken eggs during a farmers' protest against the EU in 1994.
"Siberian teaches, EU stops", was one of the slogans.
The farmers in Espalde dropped tons of snow.
The 1999 Helsinki EU Summit also saw farmers protest and burn hay outside the meeting place.
The nurses went on strike in 1983 and 1995.
Nurses went on strike for about a month in 1995.
The last time they went on strike was in 1983.
The strike of 1995 was marked by a few deaths during the strike.
You threatened to strike and fire nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass deportation finally led to the negotiations.
Doctors went on strike in 2001 .
"Doctors on strike - forcing", was the slogan of the doctors on strike in 2001.
The strike by local doctors and hospitals lasted for about five months and sparked a lively discussion about how strikes can jeopardize patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised doctors' salaries.
Students on the move in 2013
In 2013, around 5 000 students marched in Helsinki from the Senate Tower to the Parliament House in support of their studies.
The Central Criminal Police is investigating the background of a Finnish truck full of refugees for the Austrian police.
The Austrian police have asked the Central Criminal Police for help in investigating the background of a migrant truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, Austrian police stopped a truck carrying 42 refugees in Aisterheim, near the German border.
It is not known whether the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
The people on the refrigerator were all in good condition.
We've been exchanging information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and main responsibility lies with the crime scene in Austria, says Tero Haapala, Chief Inspector of the Central Criminal Police.
At the end of August, other refugees in Austria who were traveling in trucks met a more fatal fate.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board apparently died of suffocation.
According to the public broadcaster Yleisradio, which first reported on the cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited company.
The company is engaged in, among other things, the restaurant business and its CEO is a man of foreign origin, about 40 years old.
Two Iraqi men have been arrested in Austria on charges of human trafficking.
A captain who beat up refugees, a former drug trafficker and a rich businessman. The story of five smugglers.
A greedy king of smugglers, a violent boat driver, a stylish missionary and a self-righteous cab driver.
For example, such people are involved in human smuggling into the European Union.
Criminologist Andrea Di Nicola of the University of Trento and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers", and their book The Death Travel Agency is being published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present the backdrop of human trafficking, offer solutions and introduce smugglers at all levels of the business.
HS will present five of them.
I 'll kick your ass right now .
The Kerkenna Islands off the east coast of Tunisia are not a popular destination for foreign tourists, but many Tunisians head there for the summer.
The islands are also ideal for smuggling because of their location, being only 120 kilometers from the Italian island of Lampedusa.
For comparison, the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometres.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives the Emir, a chained-up captain and father of six children.
The Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimp, but it's more profitable for a fisherman to transport people.
And that's what Emir has done in his blue, 30-foot wooden boat hundreds of times.
If the boat is full, it can hold 40 people.
The Emir earns about 8,000 euros after expenses for one trip.
Emir has five assistants who look for clients all over Tunisia.
Customers come from many countries, but during the Arab Spring, a huge number of Tunisians fled the unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until the refugee crisis again began to flare up.
Customers arrive in small groups from the mainland to Kerkenna Island.
The Emir will house them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
The food is served in such a way that the customers barely survive.
The cost of accommodation is about 75 euros a night, and if the customer runs out of money, it's their problem.
We'll be out on the water at midnight with the lights off.
The first night, you drive off the islands, then you pull over, wait for the day, and drive the next night to Lampedusa.
Sometimes the sea is rough, and in 20-meter-high waves, passengers cry and vomit.
At the destination, the human cargo will be unloaded in half an hour and the Emir will be on his way back.
Emir wants to be feared.
That's why he beats his clients, and at least he claims to beat the hanging men to death.
In his book, he relates that when a policeman once caught him, he threw all his passengers overboard and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I grabbed customers by the neck one by one and threw them overboard", says Emir.
The quietest travelers come from the Sahara.
His countrymen say he's got to beat this one up for this.
I'll kick your ass right now.
We need to show them who's in charge here immediately.
Just a regular cab driver .
Goran is a regular cab driver in Bogovača, Serbia.
His cab's not very good, the starter is dying, and he's seen his best days anyway.
However, the most important thing for Goran's customers is that the taxi is moving at all and that it is moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 40 miles [60 km] southwest of Belgrade.
The village is adjacent to an asylum centre, which is mainly for families.
In the forests surrounding the city, men traveling without their families are housed in tents, huts, and abandoned cars, which each has now managed to find or build.
The forest also has families who, for one reason or another, have not applied for asylum in Serbia.
Some are also housed in private residences, but that's a public secret.
Among the savages, Goran finds most of his clients.
They are often walking exhausted - the route through the Balkans requires a large number of border crossings and weeks of walking through difficult terrain, often in mountainous areas and in darkness.
When they finally reach the Bogovada area, a major hub for human trafficking, the people are dead tired.
Goran's passengers are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in his book.
"They say their piece once and that's enough", Goran praises.
He says the Africans are trying to pick a fight.
That's not what Goran likes.
You're a fool, you're a fool, you're a fool all the way.
First, they agree on a price of, say, 300 euros, then they cut it down to 200 and finally offer 150.
Goran emphasizes that he is a kind and good-hearted man.
I'm not interested in money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people", he says in the book.
Goran says he works cheaper than others and charges only 50 euros per person for transport to the Hungarian border.
It's a thousand miles, most of it on a comfortable highway.
I heard the colleagues are asking for three or four times the price.
Goran earns about 50,000 euros a year.
It's not a lot of money for a smuggler, but it's a pretty nice annual income in Serbia.
Serbia has ordered that taxis not be allowed to transport migrants within 12 kilometres of the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care: he knows the roads and shortcuts and takes his passengers a mile from the border.
Then he points his customers in the right direction and then he's gone.
In a Work of Mercy
A 35-year-old man in the Congo is called a Missionary, and that is not just a nickname.
Indeed, in Kampala, the capital of Uganda, he has a Protestant church that is frequented by many Congolese refugees, and a small center that helps Congolese refugee children.
In addition to preaching, the missionary runs a smuggling business that moves people from the Congo to Europe.
He thinks he's doing a work of mercy.
It's important to look good as a missionary.
She polishes her shoes many times a day and makes sure that the rubber band of her white underwear sticks out elegantly under the low waist of her jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, SUV, and three motorcycles.
When not preaching, the missionary organizes people from the Congo to Uganda and on to Europe.
The customer first calls one of the five missionary telephone numbers.
He advises arriving at the border in the morning, hiding the money in a safe place, and mingling with the merchants crossing the border.
To obtain asylum or refugee status, you must tell the Ugandan authorities that you are from, say, a war zone in North Kivu and that you have been forced to flee violence in your home.
Often that's true, but if it's not, the missionary arranges for the client to have a new identity.
The old identity card is destroyed and replaced by a new one.
A missionary's contacts in the Ugandan police help.
The client is then directed to the same place where the real asylum seekers go: to the asylum procedure, to NGOs, finally to the UNHCR.
The missionary knows the red tape, having come to Uganda as a refugee himself.
He charges for each step separately: filing an application with the Ugandan police costs about 100 euros, handling documents for a humanitarian organisation about 150 euros and the process of moving to, say, a European country costs between 4 500 and 7 000 euros.
Foil and ice cubes
Tom is a novice smuggler, former drug courier.
A 40-year-old Irishman is on patrol off the French coast in Calais, where his job is to load people onto trucks bound for Britain.
He has an Afghan living in London, a French taxi driver, and dozens of truck drivers who may not even know they're in the human smuggling business.
At night, Tom and the cab driver pick up their customers, usually two or three people, somewhere near the centre of Calais.
They're driving on the A26 trying to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would go straight to jail for organizing illegal immigration.
Tom doesn't want that. He's been in prison for seven years for drugs.
The taxi stops, Tom and his customers run across the highway to a rest stop where the drivers sleep before continuing across the Channel to Brittany.
Tom chooses the right truck, makes sure it's going to England instead of Holland, and then he cuts the safety belt on the safety cover.
It's got to be quiet, so the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver is involved, but then it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his customer in aluminum foil, the same as the one wrapped around a roast or oven potato in the kitchen.
It should keep the police's heat scanners from spotting who's hiding.
Some use an ice-filled sleeping bag for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck and leaves the scene, hoping that the driver will not rush the smugglers at least before Britain.
The King of Smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the most famous human smugglers in the world.
The rich Turkish has been called the master of marketing and the undisputed king of illegal landings in the Mediterranean, controlling the sea routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been operating since the 1990s and has continuously developed new smuggling methods.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: He demands money only when he arrives.
One of the new methods is the luxury ship scam, whereby a leisure fund is allegedly chartered from Turkish ports to take American or European families on comfortable, tourist cruises of a few days.
In reality, the ships are full of Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who are transported from Istanbul to a port on land and then by sea to Europe for a fee of between EUR 5 000 and 7 000.
Customers are kept in human warehouses, such as old industrial buildings, until it is time for them to leave.
They're gonna put people in minivans and drive them somewhere along the coast.
They're told to hide in the vegetation and wait for the signal.
Once it's given, we must board quickly.
Passengers must remain hidden under the deck for the entire journey.
The Coast Guard can only observe the depth of the ship, since no other signs of a crowd are visible.
Food and drink are provided, but the less passengers defecate and vomit, the better.
Küçük receives approximately EUR 53 000 after the expenses of a single luxury cruise.
Instead of handling the practical matters himself, he hires captains, recruiters, guards, hosts, and other lesser agents to do the work for him.
In the summer, there are at least hundreds of transports and Küçük makes millions.
He is believed to have acquired land, a pharmaceutical company and over 100 apartments through shell companies.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as a Turkish Democratic Party MP and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
Since then, he's obviously been missing.
Correction: The book Death Travel Agency is coming out this week, not next week.
In her book, an American Olympic runner tells of her illness and her prostitution.
A new book by three-time Olympic 1500-meter runner Suzy Favor Hamilton has drawn attention in the United States.
In his book Fast Girl, Favor Hamilton talks about quitting his career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated published excerpts from the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton ended his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came into the race in top form and finished second in the qualifying round.
But in the finals, he panicked.
He was on top right from the start, defending his lead with a manic run.
But 150 yards before the goal, his strength was over.
He collapsed on the track, and the other competitors passed him one by one.
I felt like an idiot and I thought I'd never run again.
But I forced myself to cross the finish line, Favor Hamilton says in his book.
It was later revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself felt enormous pressures to succeed.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but she was fascinated by the idea of making money by having sex with strangers.
She also persuaded her husband to approve of her actions.
Hamilton Favor's fee was 450 euros an hour.
He says he spent the money on luxury.
Another explanation given by Favor Hamilton for becoming a prostitute was that he wanted the same adrenaline rushes he had from competing in track and field.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out that he had bipolar disorder.
The former star runner's double life came to light in late 2012 when Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton competed in the Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney Olympics.
In 2000, he set a world record of 3.57.40 in the 1,500 meters, but finished last in the Sydney Olympics.
The world champion cheered as the federation disciplined the Norwegian ski jumper, "Straight-back".
The Norwegian skiing king, Petter Northug, has crossed the line of propriety, at least in the opinion of one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Federation have been twisting the athlete's contract all summer and fall, just like last year.
Although the federation has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been enough for the multiple world champion and Olympic champion.
As a result of the contract dispute, the Norwegian Ski Federation decided to exclude Northug from the World Cup next season.
The decision was praised by two-time world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad the union disciplined the ski jumper.
"Thank you for showing your back", Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook page.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for a federation sponsor", he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Federation and Northug is about money.
Apparently, Northug would like to be part of the national team for the season so he can advertise his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent an association that cares about future generations and doesn't leave one athlete alone.
He also stressed that the Union had granted Northhug financial and other privileges for many years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb doesn't accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just because he's the best.
Northug issued a statement on Tuesday asserting that he would like to represent Norway at the World Cup next season and then the World Cup and the Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six World Cup medals in her career, including two golds.
He was on the team that won the gold medal last winter in Falun.
The day of the shield of the roasters is also celebrated in the Nordic countries
On the day of the festival, September 25, there will be a pickup in various restaurants and shops that have been awarded the "Fried Translators" badge.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland's high level of culinary expertise and to lower the threshold for leaving the restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of high quality.
At the same time, it is worth noting that not all high-quality restaurants are concentrated in the capital region, but top restaurants, checked and rated by an independent operator, can be found throughout Finland.
The international attention it has received is a testament to its importance as a way of raising awareness of the chain and the organisation.
In the northern part of the country, the day will be held in Vaasa, in the restaurant Fondis and in Kantarelli.
The festival is being held in Kokkola, with the participation of the restaurant Old Town.
The event has also received considerable international attention.
It has been decided to make the event one of the organization's major international events, held on the same day in different parts of the world.
Finland will continue to host the event.
The Court of Justice has been informed of the establishment of the Terrible Reception Centre
The Finnish Migration Agency and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are cooperating to establish a refugee reception centre on the grounds of the former garrison of Kauhava, currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
The complaint states that the area still has a permanent nature of critical infrastructure, which is used by the Defence Forces and its partner, Finland's Special Networks Ltd.
The Kauhajoki newspaper reports that the private individual said that placing the reception centre in the same building would pose a significant security risk, which was not taken into account in the preparation of the case.
The complainant claims that the Defence Forces may have interests in the area of the former Air War College and the airport, the impact of which has not been ascertained during the preparation of the reception centre.
The case states that for the last two years, negotiations have been held on the organisation of flight training and the possible entry of a foreign operator to the airport.
The issue was discussed with, among others, Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (PS) and Arto Rady, Chief of Staff of the Ministry of Defence.
The individual submits to the Registrar that the complaint is not a matter of objection in principle from the reception centre but that the planned location in the former garrison area is wrong.
The terrible city council handled the reception center issue last Monday.
The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU citizens who are in the EU to a maximum of 15 per cent.
The President said that the concern for the management of the refugee situation united all participants.
He said the EU had to be more open to the idea of a common foreign and security policy.
Especially in these times when we face great challenges.
The situation in Syria, as well as the actions of Russia and the United States in the region, could also have an impact on Ukraine and, consequently, on the Baltic Sea region.
The Commission is optimistic about the development of the dialogue.
If that situation develops in a positive direction, that is to say the United States and Russia are able to, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the continuing tensions in the Baltic Sea.
The report also states that the NATO question was also sidelined in the discussions.
The president didn't make a statement about the labor market.
Finnair is cancelling 16 domestic flights on Friday, starting a couple hours before closing.
One flight is cancelled Thursday and 15 on Friday.
The list of cancelled flights can be found on Finnair's website.
Finavia reports that the airport operations are managed by the management during the stoppage.
However, traffic jams and delays at security checkpoints and other service points are to be expected.
Protests close down streets in central Helsinki
The demonstration on Friday will close down the streets of central Helsinki.
Police say the streets leading to the railway tunnel will be closed to vehicles from about 9:30 to 2:00.
Cars are not allowed to enter the direction of the mainland from the Kaivakattu, the Postkattu and the Töölönlahdenkattu railway stations.
From Union Street in the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is diverted to Union Street at the Kaisaniemi traffic circle.
According to the police, the closing time depends on the number of people attending the demonstration.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed in the area.
Metro and tram drivers will be on the streets all Friday .
Metro and tram drivers will take part in a demonstration on Friday morning from morning traffic to night traffic.
The railway and metro workers' association informed STT about the incident this evening.
Most of the Alko's will close for two hours, even with the post office closed.
The protest on Friday will also cause disruption to the Postal Service.
Significant delays are expected, for example, in the delivery of daily mail.
Most of the post offices are closed.
The Finnish Red Cross is still running the blood drive despite the strike.
Meal transportation, hospital shipments and laboratory samples are also being taken care of.
The status of services is available on the Post's website.
Most of the Finnish Alps close their doors for two hours on Fridays.
The service industry union Pam has instructed its employees to stop working between 11 and 1 p.m.
Pam has also urged workers in the grocery store to join the trade union demonstration.
The representatives of SOK and Kesko tell Helsingin Sanom that they will try to keep the stores open if necessary by force majeure.
According to Kesko, no information is available yet on the possible closure of individual shops.
Helsinki day care centres partially closed
The Helsinki Department of Early Childhood Education reports that day care centers in Helsinki will not be fully functional on Friday.
In response to the protests of the professional associations, day care may be concentrated in certain day care centres and no club activities in day care centres and playgrounds will be organised.
Daycare centers and groups for children with developmental disabilities and multiple disabilities will remain open.
In addition, afternoon activities for students with developmental disabilities and autism are normally organised.
The Department of Early Childhood Education promises to provide more information about the changes in operations tomorrow.
Media analyst: The bee is taking a big risk
The Commission has also been involved in the preparation of the draft directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to carcinogens.
This kind of direct speech channel is also needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä told reporters in parliament.
The Commission has not yet decided on the frequency of the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches.
According to Sparrow, speeches may not always be broadcast on the YLE channels in the future.
If any other channels sign up to be channels, then let's see.
"Now we'll use this channel tonight", said the Squirrel.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires a television and radio address to the citizens.
This is a rather complex issue which requires a longer discussion.
That's why we ended up on this channel.
The speech will be broadcast from 21.05 to 21.20 on both TV1 and Radio Finlandia.
You can also watch it at the Yule Arena.
The owl takes a big risk
The media researcher hopes Sipilä's television speech does not reveal a more general government inward-looking.
Is it an attempt to take more power over the public debate and to refuse to question the public debate?
I am reminded of the recent comment by Foreign Minister (Timo) Soini that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define him.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope these matters are not connected.
I understand the commercial media is outraged by the announcement of the Squirrel.
It would be strange if the media field didn't respond.
The communication styles of policy makers are not a matter of publicity in a democracy.
The role of the media is to ensure that politicians' agendas are not taken for granted.
Koivusi says that the TV speech is a big risk for Sipil.
The sparrow should bring something new and special to the table when it speaks to meet the exceptionally high expectations set for the speech.
Is there anything else on the table today that we've already heard?
Or can he speak in a different tone, a different way, or different words, or say something new?
Koivunen says that if the promise is just more of the same old thing, one has to wonder why such a big gesture was made and Yle gave it an exceptional time.
I would like to say that I am not in favour of the Commission's proposal to introduce a new system of taxation.
There is a danger that the message of politicians or parliament and government will be branded as a message which is certainly not in line with the interests of the party or the general line.
A sly move by a lizard
The media expert stresses that what the Prime Minister does not say is also important in Sipila's forthcoming speech.
In the evening, we should look carefully at what Sipilä lacks and what it lacks, says Heikki Kuutti, research coordinator at Jyväskylä University.
Kuut said the TV speech was a clever move by Sipil, because it allowed him to express his own views without any noise.
This will allow the message to reach a wide audience without the journalistic filter, unlike a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
The Sparrow is going to bypass the media and speak directly to the people.
However, there is a danger that the media will misinterpret the speech because they will not allow detailed questions to be asked.
According to Kuut, it's very important how the Gull is portrayed on TV - the amount of sweat, whether the hands are shaking.
He's likening Sipil to a father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipil can present his case well, it can work.
It is different from a governmental announcement, for here one person is speaking directly to another.
This is what Obama and his associates do regularly.
It 's really extraordinary .
Political researcher Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister's speech to the citizens to be truly exceptional.
He said that this had not happened in decades for a prime minister to speak directly to the people.
"Exceptional times require exceptional means", says Railo.
The researcher believes that the prime minister wants to get the Finns sympathetic to the forthcoming blackmail.
On Friday, the workers' organizations will organize a demonstration and strike against the government's actions.
The chairman of the Left Alliance, Paavo Arhinmäki, says on Twitter that Sipilä could make a speech on the state of the nation in parliament as a prime minister's announcement, which would also allow for discussion.
The report also calls for the EU to be involved in the fight against terrorism.
This is no time for monologues.
Six months from the election.
You can't hide forever, Rinne wrote on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy on the run has been found in Tampere .
The boy was in good health when he was found.
The boy's father updated his Facebook page.
The police department also confirmed the incident to the Evening Standard.
The boy went out to play at four o'clock in the afternoon.
Later that night, no further contact was made.
Dad thanks everyone who helped him find it.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations you've made in the last few hours.
The update was shared close to 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short time.
The Finnish UFC star was disappointed by the violent wilding of young people:
Volunteer activist Makwan Amirkhani posted a video on Facebook that appeals specifically to young people from immigrant backgrounds.
Makwan Amirkhani was to make a powerful speech against street fighting by young people.
Born in Iran and arriving in Finland with his family at the age of five, Amirkhani has won both of his professional fights in the most prestigious UFC freestyle series.
Amirkhani says he got a text asking him to look at an Instagram account.
The account has been uploaded videos of teenagers fighting in extremely violent ways.
Amirkhani says he's disappointed in the way the youths are being made crazy.
Amirkhan, 26, has more than 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys kick people on the ground, sit on top of each other and hit each other without any thought of these consequences, what happens when you do these videos, Amirkhani updates.
It 's hard to defend anymore .
Some of the young people in these videos are immigrant.
According to Helsinki Police Commissioner Jarmo Heinosen, the fighting videos on social media have been uploaded by both immigrants and native Finnish youths.
The fact that you guys are fighting in the street.
You make the lives of so many other immigrants in Finland more difficult, reminds Amirkhani from Turkey.
Amirkhani reminds that in Finland there are websites that search for crimes committed by immigrants.
These isolated cases have become quite outrageous.
It's a little hard, boys, defending you anymore.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign land and will be visitors here for quite some time.
That's a slightly different way of saying thank you for being here, says Amirkhani.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever become the victims of racism, you will blame yourselves.
Now, you guys, think twice before you go along with this.
Amirkhani says that violent action fuels racism.
You're making me hate you in a way that I don't like myself.
You're in a pretty bad place anyway, and you're not gonna make it any better, Amirkhani decides.
SAK pledges its stance on the austerity package
The chairman of the SAK, Lauri Lyly, said on Twitter that the employee association would consider its position on Monday on the alternative savers proposed by the STTK.
Lauri Lyly commented on the STTK proposal on Twitter.
The STTK, a union of staffing agencies, said earlier on Wednesday it would present its own proposal to the government to achieve the five percent productivity cut demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of education and training.
However, this would require the largest employee organisation, SAK, to soften its position.
The SAK chairman, Lauri Lyly, commented on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAC working committee will consider the matter on Monday.
Lylly said the SAK was looking for solutions to 'open up the labour market' and that agreements between active parties were needed to replace mandatory laws.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a new directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
The Commission has already concluded that the aid was necessary to ensure that the aid was compatible with the internal market.
Comment: "The show of greatness threatens to slip". "It feels a little funny to punch".
It may feel a little funny to punch if you already have a piece of paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The mood at the mercenary camp varies from one end to the other.
Is it to yell at the government to overthrow it or to make a deal with it?
On Monday, the leaders of the SAK alliance expressed their holy rage against the government of the Republic.
Threatened to shut down the whole of Finland.
The threat was spreading to the Akawa.
The teachers' union OAJ threatened to close schools and daycare centers.
On Tuesday, the OAJ cancelled. No school or day care center will be closed completely.
The Commission has also adopted a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
He said he had contacted the government and was preparing an alternative proposal for a five percent productivity cut demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center).
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of education and training.
At first, there was no word of a yard from the SAK office.
The report also calls for the EU to be able to take on board the EU's nuclear programme.
However, Lyly finally announced that the SAC's working committee would meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that the SAC would seek solutions to "open up the labour market".
In order to create a common representation among employees, the SAA should tend to adopt a 5% productivity cut as a target.
No wonder Palolan's NSC has good relations with the Sipil government.
The right-hand man of Palola, Jukka Ihanus, the director of the STTK's social impact, previously served as special assistant to the Prime Ministers of the Centre, Matti Vanhasen and Mari Kiviniemi.
Palola described the government's Ay skills as being constantly improving.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should be given a mandate to investigate the alleged violations of the principle of subsidiarity.
I know it feels a little weird to punch a guy when you already have a piece of paper in your pocket.
Edited at 6:00 p.m. to add to the list of comments made by Lilly.
Russia accused Finland of being a bad host: 'This must not happen again'
The President of the Russian Duma, Sergei Naryshkin, criticized the Helsinki Conference of the Enterprise.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of energy.
The autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the OCTs began in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia, where Naryshkin gave extensive comments on the July celebration in Helsinki.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of education and training.
We considered that this was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, Naryshkin stressed, according to the Interfax news agency.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin's criticism was directed at the United States, where he was also banned from entering.
The EU's sanctions are political suicide, he said.
The Russian delegation arrived in Mongolia without incident, so Naryshkin continued to poke Finland by praising and thanking Mongolia for its "excellent organization".
I am confident that the Parliamentary Assembly will proceed constructively and with positive results, unlike the one held in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that there should be no obstacles to parliamentary dialogue.
Naryshkin has met with the meeting leader Ilkka Kanerva (cook) in Ulan Bator, who has already held talks with the Russian delegation, according to Russian media.
The lock is facing the real playoff troll, "goals in a nutshell".
Tappara and Lock continue their bull days in Hakam Forest today, as both are on fire for the second day in a row.
Janne Lahti predicts that no real celebration of goals will be held in Hakamets today.
Tappara came to Kuopi yesterday to cheer for a 3-2 over Kalpa.
The rise was manly, as last season's silver team was at its worst after a two-goal deficit.
Tuesday was a lot more fun.
The Blues, who had started the game with a bang, had a round zero score and a losing record of 2-3.
Tough game, goals close, if they play anything like last year, Lock striker Janne Lahti predicts the setup on the club's side.
The killer's turned into a playoff nightmare for the Ravens.
Because in the last two seasons, Tappara has dropped out of the finals of the same series as Luko.
Both times, the deciding seventh game was required.
Last season, Lock cut the series in the fourth game, but Tappara moved up the next three and passed.
There are no major changes in the squad, except for the goalkeepers.
The cashiers who were both rejected yesterday will be paid a small fee today.
With the goal of the Tappara, Mika Noronen makes room for Tom Bear, and between the Lock-Pols, Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
Point of view: a bad play in progress
Sports director Toivola wrote an inappropriate sequel for head coach Iron Maiden, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote the script for the movie Rocky, in which he himself played the lead role.
The challenger sensationally put the world heavyweight champion Apollo Creed in the ring.
Rocky was a big fan, even though he lost the title fight.
Thirty years after the premiere of Rocky, Mika Toivola wrote the story of the restless ashes of Pori.
The nameless, knife-handed potato chipper, to everyone's surprise, advanced to the 2006 SM finals.
The team was full of unnamed but tenacious underdogs like Rocky.
There was a white Indian, a Porin Matt, and a Pele Field.
In the playoffs, the players would dye their heads red and cut off their Iroquois.
Hope turned into a blonde.
The great TV anchor JP Jalo called Coach Neumann.
The ace took the silver.
Hope was one of the heroes.
The writer Toivola believes that this season's novella will work the same way as it did ten years ago.
A man who works as the Ace's athletic director has built a patchwork of bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been digging up guys in the back like Rocky pigs in a slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäen, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparisen's merits are somewhere other than in the disc-playing game.
I think you're forgetting that Rocky VI has the lead role of Big Iron Rock.
Karri Stone has crossed Iron Stone for Sean Connery.
The Iron Rock is as clumsy a lead actor in the scripted Rocky as Connery would have been in the original 1976 production.
There's nothing in the Iron Throne but Rocky as a nickname.
The Iron Calf's philosophy is not to rush and play tricks.
He appreciates a hard game, but it's one thing to play hard like a pig.
Last season, Garret Stafford of the Aces knocked Tappara Jere of the Cowboys over the head.
He got two minutes and ten minutes from the judges, but the Iron Rock put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only play the ones who deserve it.
I don't approve of this kind of game, and it's not part of the ace race. Iron Man, who was hot, went after the game to the Hundred Kingdoms.
The Aces this season are a weirdly structured team.
There are trains, there are veterans, there are cops and there are lifeguards.
There are virtually no key players of the best playing age.
No wonder the head coach has been complaining about a lack of skill.
How much influence have you had on player acquisitions, Big Iron?
Last season's events are affecting procurement and unfortunately the market situation was rather tight, Irutakallio replied diplomatically.
There's a cop under the surface.
The 1953 model year Iron Horse is reportedly interested in moving to the position of sports director.
The men's contracts expire in the spring.
The aces are tied at 1-6 in three league games this season.
I don't think it would have been a good idea for him to write a sequel.
Olga Temonen is playing the mother of Sipe Santapuk.
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuuka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen is acting for the first time under the direction of her husband.
Yes, I play the mother of my husband's friend in the movie.
In a way, it feels crazy, the actress and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
She has been married to former bassist and director Tuukka Temose of Apulanna since 2008.
The couple has worked together before, but this is the first time Olga has acted under Tuuka's direction.
Olga's role in the film You Made Us Beautiful, which tells the story of Apulanna's early years, is that of drummer Sipe Santapuk's mother, Sirkka.
Sirkka is supportive of her son, even though his father, Risto (played by Lorenz Backmann), tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I get to know my real role model, the easier it seems to be to play the part.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuuka for trusting me with the part.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but since then the two have become very close.
They've met, talked on the phone, texted.
The grass has been a great help.
We've gone through a lot of different angles in their history.
And it's also a good thing that Sirkka understands that drama is drama and the truth may need a little coloring.
Olga emphasizes that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that ApuLannas would become the biggest band in Finland.
The '90s were a recession. It was really sad.
There was a pretty slim chance that anyone would actually make it, but Sirka had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga says that she had heard a lot from Tuuka about his youth before filming.
But sometimes the parents' stories have been a little different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much do your parents really know about what you did?
Olga reveals that her own youth was very different from that of Tuuka, known as Heinolan's notorious skateboarder.
Olga was a simple, nice girl who had nothing to do with the movie Tuuka.
The best he could have done was fall in love with her in secret.
Olga says that she has worked with Tuuka so much in the last 10 years that a big joint project is not scary.
Everything's always been super great.
Now the whole production team is going to shoot in Heinola for a month.
True, a couple in the city often plan to drive home for the night because of their young children, since the distance is not too long.
We'll take over the whole of Heinola for a month.
They've given us a very warm welcome, just asking which streets and when to clear.
Iron Sky 2 became the most expensive Finnish drama film
The film Iron Sky: The Coming Race, directed by Timo Vuorensola, has a budget of 17 million euros.
We're shooting in Belgium in October.
Director Timo Vuorensola is set to start shooting Iron Sky 2 in Belgium in October.
The sequel to the sci-fi film Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, becomes the most expensive Finnish drama film of all time with a budget of 17 million euros.
Previously, the title of Finland's most expensive film has been Jalmari Helander's Big Game.
The ongoing Angry Birds animation will also surpass Iron Sky 2 once completed, with a budget of over €100 million.
The film, directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaan, will start shooting in October at the AED Studios near Antwerp and will last eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola is leaving for Belgium next week.
I'm not afraid of a giant budget.
I've been so sick of relaxing!
I have such a relaxed feel for the script because I know exactly what kind of movie it should be.
Everyone on the task force seems to realize that we're doing something unprecedented.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though time is tight, there's no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited and I can't wait to show this movie to the public", she tells Iltalehti.
The film was originally budgeted at $8 million to $10 million, but as the script progressed, the budget also increased.
It's a big budget, but it's also a big story.
But I'm afraid it would cost $100 million to make a movie because every angle and every effect is so expensive.
Now everything's twisted so tightly, there's not a drop of loose.
The film's production company, Iron Sky Universe, launched a crowdfunding campaign on Wednesday and a bond offering an annual interest rate of 4 to 8 percent.
The final rate shall be determined by supply and demand during the campaign.
The company shall repay the loan within two years at the latest.
The film stars Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
- What's that?
Big logos are coming back on shirts .
The trendsetters' fronts have recently been decorated with large logos.
Not long ago, a fashion conscious person avoided clear, large logos like Crocces as a trap.
Advertising a sweater or a T-shirt was seen as a bit of a joke.
But times are changing.
Sports have become a real fashion mega-trend, and so have old, familiar sportswear brands like Adidas and Nike.
And as so often before, the line between funny and trendy is blurry: if something is already really cool, it starts to become ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, or the taboo fashion, where the trendsetters surprised by favoring the most boring basic clothing as a way to stand out from the crowd.
Now, instead of the gray basic college, they put on that shirt buried in the bottom of the closet with the manufacturer's gorgeous logo on the front.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to logos, Adidas' recognizable tracksuits, fan-team jerseys, and New York Yankees flags have also made a comeback.
The Calvin Klein logos on the underwear that start at the edge of the jeans are now a cool detail.
The trend seems to be moving from sports brands to luxury brands.
For example, the front of Versace's autumn sweaters makes it clear which iconic garment is in question.
Would you be willing to show off logos in your outfit?
A Russian politician published evidence that I wasn't stuck in a tank door for hours!
The alleged special incident took place in Nizhni Tagil, where the Russia Arms Expo 2015 was held, showcasing products of the Russian defence industry.
In recent days, the Russian media have reported in colorful terms that the Russian Emergency Management Agency had to detach the large Zotov from the tank door for five hours.
Zotov has since done everything he can to deny the information.
He even posted a picture on his own public Facebook page showing him peering out of the hatch of an armored vehicle in a rather good mood, and at least the pictures show no sign of being stuck or angry.
It's all bullshit.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go in a tank. It was a BMP-3.
I'm an ex-soldier myself, Lieutenant Colonel, I served in the Urals.
I went in there, looked around and came out peacefully, Zotov told Komsomolskaya Pravda.
I wasn't stuck, and I certainly didn't spend five hours in that position, he said.
Zotov told the Russian military TV channel that he was fascinated by the new Russian technology at the exhibition because he himself is a former professional soldier.
That's why I was interested in what was inside the wagons, I was fascinated by our technology.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I've been to every tank.
And in the next exhibition, I will definitely visit all the tanks and all the armored fighting vehicles, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the reporter who wrote the story a fool.
One idiot wrote it and everyone else repeated it.
There was no such thing.
I went in, and I came out.
I am tall and rotten, but nothing like being stuck in a tank somewhere happened", he told Russkaja sluzhba novotei radio.
Zotov's statement is supported by the fact that no photograph of the alleged trapped gun has been published, despite the fact that 50,000 people visited the exhibition in a few days.
The allegation of Zotov's being trapped originated from a story on the Bloknot.ru website, where Zotov was told that he had broken out of the tank door while trying to escape and eventually threatened to shoot everyone around him if he did not get out of his cage.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up story in which the exhibition organizers shared their views on what happened.
Everyone's just used to soldiers jumping out of armored vehicles quickly.
But Congressman Zotov, because of his size, simply lingered when he came out.
But he certainly did not sit there for five hours, said Alexander Pisarevski, coordinator of the exhibition, to Bloknot.
This is the favorite item of the interior bloggers
Designed by architects Mogens (1901-87) and Flemming (1902-84), Lassen's 1962 pinnacle looks as if it were designed today.
A cubic steel skeleton is like a work of art, and that's what it was originally.
The architectural brothers are known for refining the shape of the nail for a long time with mathematical precision.
It was originally presented only to the distinguished dinner guests of the gentlemen.
The cube candles are made by the family company By Lassen, which continues the design heritage of the famous brothers.
The candles are handmade in Holstebro, Denmark, in eight, four and one-candle versions, in four different colours.
The cube comes in black, white, and nickel and copper.
The candle is very relevant right now and it fits into many homes.

You don't want to stay put. You want to move on.
You emphasize a certain thing about yourself so much that someone starts talking to you about it.
This conversation is not gonna end.
It just goes to show how interesting you are.
A leak has occurred at the Kittilä mine of Agnico Eagle, a Canadian-owned mining company.
The process water purified from the gold mine has been leaking into the ditch from what is called the enrichment basin.
The company has announced that measures to correct the leak have been initiated.
The pool contains neutralized enrichment sludge from the foaming process and purified process water.
In general, the water is either pumped for reuse as process water or discharged into the environment via a surface treatment plant as permitted.
The leak was estimated to be about 300 cubic meters per hour when it was detected.
The company claims that the quality of the leakage water meets the current permit requirements.
Nothing else was released into the environment.
The leak was detected on a routine inspection Monday morning.
No structural damage to the pool's damaged structures has been detected.
The company says it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and remedy the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent workers.
Danish Minister for Foreign Affairs warns against cutting too much
The report on the country of Finland published today by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) broadly follows the views of the government and the Treasury.
The organisation pushed Finland to undertake comprehensive structural reforms to cope with economic problems.
The IMF believes that reducing overtime pay and paid holidays would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed to the whole system of contracts and to unemployment insurance.
Danske Bank's chief economist Pasi Kuoppamaai said that while there was agreement on structural reforms, there were some minor differences.
The IMF's assessment contains many messages of sympathy for the government's actions, but also contains words of warning about what should not be cut too much.
This is the case, for example, with infrastructure investments, says Kuoppamäki.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be implemented as quickly as possible to support weak economic growth.
The IMF forecasts Finland's economic growth rate to be 0.4% this year, accelerating to 0.9% next year.
In its new economic forecast, Danske forecasts growth to be at zero this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic about this year.
They could have been based on the latest observations.
This morning the Statistics Office reported that total production was in a low growth in the summer, notes Kuoppamäki.
The decline in industrial confidence or other so-called softer indicators may have once again attracted less attention.
The differences, however, are only a few percent decimal places.
Nintendo , recovering from a deathbed , has appointed a new CEO .
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer in July, will start work on Wednesday, Nintendo said Monday.
Iwata had been running Nintendo since 2002 and was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
Iwata, for example, was responsible for the successful launch of the Wii console.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names that were put forward as possible successors to Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow in Iwata's footsteps, Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda told Reuters.
Kimishima's mission is seen as bringing Nintendo heavily into mobile gaming, but not eating the company's bread on the side of traditional gaming consoles.
More and more minors arriving in Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Migration Agency admitted that up to hundreds of children who have arrived in the country disappear every year.
The Swedish Migration Agency reports that hundreds of minors disappear every year in Sweden, according to SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter.
The Finnish Immigration Service's inspector-general, Juha Kannelmaa, explains the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is it the same in Finland?
How many asylum seekers go "underground" each year? - In Finland, a total of 156 unaccompanied minors applied for asylum in 2013.
Nine of them disappeared.
In 2014, 196 such applications were made and 11 of them disappeared, says Kannelma.
The reason for the disappearance may be that the proceedings show that the applicant is already registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and has been found to be of legal age there.
In this case, it may be more attractive for the applicant to disappear than to continue the proceedings in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for processing the application.
Similarly, some disappeared persons are also found later when they seek asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of which 134 applications were rejected on the grounds that the applicant had probably moved out of Finland, so 123 adult asylum seekers disappeared in the past year, he says.
Is it increasing?
As of 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 applications for asylum from unaccompanied minors.
He also stressed that the EU had to make a concerted effort to ensure that the EU's nuclear programme was implemented in a way that would ensure that the nuclear weapons would be used effectively.
What about those who have made the decision to convert?
Do they also disappear into the "dark market"?
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of asylum seekers in the EU to a maximum of 150.
The EU has a number of programmes to support the development of the European Union's external relations.
He's taken action on this.
The EU's minister for home affairs, Orpo, discussed refugee issues on Monday and described practical measures to control the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen is selling Timo T.A. ' s studio online . Look at the pictures of the equipment .
The equipment used by Timo T.A. Mikkos, a media pioneer who lost his ability to work due to illness, is now for sale.
Mikkonen's wife Nina Mikkonen sells devices on Huuto.net that were once the most advanced tools for professionals in their field.
The first to report the online ad was the online newspaper Iltamakasiini.
Today, much of the equipment is left behind by technological progress.
In the digital media world, we no longer record television programs on Betacam tapes.
Nina Mikkonen is confident that there will be interest.
Of course, the hardware is no longer as up-to-date, but these are needed as long as there is old-generation material that needs to be digitized.
On the other hand, there are also many amateurs, collectors and builders of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen, who is considering IS.
The reason for the sale is that the Mikkos are trying to move out of their current home in Stormland.
There's no way we can take all this stuff with us.
I've been slowly starting to inventory and see what stuff is being given away.
This is where I started, Nina Mikkonen says.
There's no use for TV and radio anymore.
The evidence of recent strokes clearly shows that a man with a long career will never return to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are sold.
The real life work of Timo T.A. Mikkonen was already archived in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to the box shop to pick up films and other material from Myrskylä.
Traffic is at risk of being more congested than expected, with subways and trams likely to be shut down all day Friday.
Metro and tram drivers will decide today whether to expand their force on Friday's demonstration.
The original plan was to suspend subway and tram services only for the Friday demonstration.
It's the afternoon to decide if we're gonna have a traffic stop for the day.
Chief Pekka Hirvonen says the threat to the field is high.
Since night and shift surgeries are bad for drivers, government plans to cut the livers are opposed.
However, Hirvonen thinks that a day's traffic is a kind of dilemma.
If the subway and tram stop on Friday, public transportation in the capital region will be virtually completely stopped.
According to VR, trains do not run on Fridays between 6am and 6pm.
There's no traffic on Friday, no long-distance or short-distance.
Trains departing before 6 a.m. will be taken to their destinations.
According to HSL, most of the buses will be left in storage.
The ACP members are absent from work on Fridays from 3 a.m. to 3 a.m. on Saturdays.
A small number of buses are likely to be driven, they are driven by a supervisory force, HSL spokesman Pirkko Repo believes.
Repo says HSL can't tell you exactly what bus shifts are running on Friday.
The employee organisations will organise a demonstration at the Helsinki Railway Station on Friday from 11 to 13 o'clock.
Hungarian police use tear gas against refugees
Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident occurred on the border of Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to make their way to Europe, reports the AP news agency.
Sky News is reporting that refugees have been trying to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of them women and children, fled in panic.
Local media reported that Hungarian police had also used water cannons against people.
A Muslim boy was arrested at a school in Texas after his teacher thought his own watch was a bomb .
In Texas, U.S.A., 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested after his teacher thought a homemade clock he brought to school was a bomb.
Mohamed told the Dallas Morning News that he just wanted to show off his electronic hobby.
But one of the teachers kept the watch looking like a bomb.
The police were called, and the situation eventually ended with the boy being taken in handcuffs to a juvenile detention cell.
At no point has Mohammed been found to claim anything other than that he had made the watch.
Still, it's possible the boy could be charged with making a fake bomb.
According to Mohammed, the police had said that the watch looked like a "movie bomb".
The watch is in police custody, but it was reportedly made up of a circuit board and a digital display with wires between them.
The incident happened last Monday and Mohamed was punished with a three-day forced vacation from school.
Her father is furious about the incident and the country's American-Islamic Council is considering whether it is another manifestation of Islamophobia in the United States.
Britain is in a state of unrest after the Labour leader refused to sing the national anthem.
The song is a plea to God to protect the Queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of the monarchy.
The criticism of the right-leaning press has been echoed by members of Corbyn's own Labour Party.
This has offended the people, said Labour MP Kate Green in a BBC radio interview.
Green thinks Corbyn should have joined the song.
Yesterday's memorial service honored the British Air Force pilots who fought the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Labour Party has issued an official statement defending Corbyn, saying he showed respect for the pilots by attending the event.
We all owe a huge debt of gratitude to the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He stood respectfully silent during the national anthem, the statement underlined.
Corbyn's election as leader has divided the Labour Party.
There are those among the MPs in particular who fear he will drive out moderate voters with his radical views.
Corbyn is in favour of a unilateral ceasefire, an end to austerity and an increase in public spending.
Corbyn is due to appear for the first time as leader of the Labour Party in Parliament today during the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Mr Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what questions should be asked of Prime Minister David Cameron.
Cameron tweeted at the weekend that Corbyn had been elected leader.
The Labour Party is a threat to our national security, our financial security and the safety of our families, the Prime Minister tweeted on his personal account.
The cause of death in the Minnesota family is still unclear . The father of the family was awaiting trial .
South Lake Minnetonka police have been investigating a family death in Greenwood, Minnesota for nearly a week.
The family of five was found dead in their home on September 10th, and a few days later, police confirmed that the shooter was the father of the family, Brian Scott Short, 45.
After first shooting his wife and three children with a shotgun, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of his home.
Dead for days .
The family was found after the school became concerned about the children's absence.
Based on this report, the police went to the house for a search and found the Short family dead on all sides of the huge house.
According to the Star Tribune, it's possible the victims had been dead for days.
A Million-dollar House and a Successful Business
The investigation into the death of South Lake Minnetonka Police Chief Michael Siitar is still ongoing.
The motive for the bloodshed is still unclear.
The shooter, Brian Short, was a successful businessman who had made his fortune on a social media site for nurses, AllNurses.com.
In a 2014 interview with StarTribune, Short said the site had four million unique visitors each week.
I've had 50 offers to buy the company in the last ten years.
I've given up on them all.
But I still have a lot of ideas I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
One of the things that helped them to succeed was the purchase of a two-million-dollar, luxury home in Greenwood in 2011.
The house is advertised on the Zillowi real estate website as a car collector's dream: not only does it have 12 rooms, but it also has a garage large enough to hold eight cars.
The case is pending.
But according to the Star Tribune, the father of the family was facing a lawsuit.
She was sued by the test prep company Achieve Test Prep over comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, Short's website had not removed comments defaming prep courses and, as a result, they had lost customers to competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a very significant impact on Short's business.
The Loire was offering the cupcake coffee.
The owner trio was also awarded the Finnish Hippo Horse Owner of the Month Award at a feeding event.
This is great, Loiri said cheerfully of his honorary plaque.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won the Derby on the first Saturday in September and won €100,000.
The legendary artist Loiri was still confused by Fabrice Duo's success in the Grand Prix.
I still can't believe that happened.
According to Loir, a successful horse trainer, working with a horse gives him complete peace of mind.
Pekka decides and decides where the horse is taken to race.
And I'm going to keep my mouth shut, Loire.
A stunningly beautiful gesture from an NHL star. "The greatest gift ever made by an athlete".
Montreal Canadiens superstar P. K. Subban has donated $10 million to the Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to a hospital press release, this is the largest single donation ever made by an athlete to a charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban has pledged to help the hospital in another fundraising effort for the next seven years.
Subban signed with the Canadiens a year ago for eight years and $72 million.
Subban's donation is therefore significantly higher than his annual income of $9 million.
As a reward for his donation, Subba will be given a hall in the hospital that bears his name.
Canadiens players have made significant contributions to local hospitals in the past.
A year ago, longtime captain Jean Beliveau, who died, raised millions of dollars for the same children's hospital, among others, and Saku Koivu raised a huge sum for another major city hospital to get the hospital the PET scanner needed for cancer research.
You can order a wife for dinner at a Japanese cafe , serve her nothing but bikinis and a skirt .
Teahouses are a big deal in Japan.
There's already goat coffee, rabbit coffee, vampire coffee, hazel coffee and now wife coffee.
It strikes lonely, lonely, lonely people, hungry people.
Metro is reporting on it.
At the Ore no Yome (My Wife) Cafe in Tokyo, you can order yourself a wife or husband for the evening.
It's a waitress pretending to be a customer's spouse.
A "husband" is chosen from the list before entering the cafe and he prepares and serves the food.

The website provides all the information about the bride-to-be, from height and weight to the mattress they prefer to sleep on.
Soon 150 million vehicles will be connected to the Internet: The cyberattacks on cars are being prepared
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological development and innovation in the industry, Intel said in a press release.
The board is made up of top security experts from around the world.
The ASRB researchers will conduct continuous security testing and audits aimed at standardising best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel released the first version of its best practices for cybersecurity.
The company will update the report based on the findings of the ASRB in the future.
The international ICT research and consultancy Gartner estimates that by 2020 some 150 million vehicles on the road will be connected to the grid.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
The same estimate suggests that 60 to 75% of these vehicles will be able to consume, create and share web-based data.
We can and must improve the cybersecurity of cars, says Chris Young, Director of Intel Security.
The ASRB will allow Intel to establish security best practices and support the view that cybersecurity is an important component of the design of every connected car.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in computing.
The Ford Focus RS costs about 52 000 euros in Finland!
The Ford Focus RS has been waiting for years like the moon rising.
Finally, the car is also starting to be in the spotlight in Finland.
Ford has released the RS data as the automotive world looks to the Frankfurt Motor Show.
Powered by a 2.3-liter, 350-horsepower engine, Ford's new four-wheel-drive RS accelerates from zero to 100 in 4.7 seconds and reaches a top speed of 175 miles per hour (266 km/ hr).
The Finnish version also has an interesting price, which is reportedly EUR 52 000.
The car is now available for order, although Ford does not say when the first cars will arrive in Finland.
At the Frankfurt Motor Show , Kia introduced two new models , the new Sportage and the Optima .
The most important of these two innovations is certainly the new fourth generation Sportage, with which Kia intends to take a bigger hand in the ever-growing market for off-road vehicles.
The new Sportage, designed by European design director Gregory Guillaume, is more round than before.
The axle spacing and the outer dimensions have been increased by an inch here and an inch there, and the car is clearing the air more efficiently.
The engine range is essentially the same, but with the addition of a 1.6-litre turbo engine producing 177 horsepower.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established the exact amount of the aid.
We're gonna have to wait a little longer, because we're getting a new Sportage in the spring of 2016.
Before the turn of the year, we'll have the new Kia Optimus in our country.
At first glance, the novelty doesn't seem to have changed, but it's a brand-new car.
Kia intends to win the hearts of upper-middle-class buyers with even better driving characteristics, lower noise levels and higher-end equipment.
Optima will be available with a 1.7-litre turbodiesel and a 2.0-litre petrol engine.
Next summer, the pace will pick up when the 2.0-litre Optima GT comes alongside them.
At the same time as its arrival, the Optima Farmer will be on sale.
Chisu returned to the stage, and he was in a bold suit.
The singer Chisu is in the "Life for a Child" concert with other local stars.
The light blue suit has a conspicuous open neck hole.
The costume is a beautiful display of the singer's chubby waist.
The whole thing is crowned with a gold metal belt and red lipstick.
During her three-year hiatus, the singer-turned-mother has shed the extra pounds with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter is about to turn one.
The singer released her first single from her new album in August.
I'm not really excited about getting back on stage and getting in front of a big crowd after a long break.
"I've missed everything music-related", says the singer.
Chisu will release his new album in a couple of weeks, and his fourth album, called Polaris.
I've been inspired to write new songs because of my new life.
At this point, I'm wondering if people will find my new album, Chisu wonders.
Kim Kardashian 's mothering style is stunning again . Now you can see her breasts .
Reality TV beauty Kim Kardashian is making headlines one after another.
She's been showing off her pregnancy belly and breasts in a wildly sexy outfit, most recently last night at 1:00 AM EST, when she walked out of a show with her sister Kourtney Kardashian and husband Kanye West.
The black maternity dress is transparent from the breasts.
It's a flash of lightning that reveals the leathery bras underneath the dress.
The last time Kardashian wore an Amazon-style maternity suit was when she visited a friend at a dinner party in New York just a few days ago.
The black high-heeled boots highlighted the outfit.
The third special maternity suit is as fresh as last Friday night when the show was on maternity.
The hard laws of modeling: no home, lonely, competition is fierce.
Top model Manon Leloup wanted to challenge the notion that the modeling world is a pure glamour and champagne party.
She made her own documentary, Speaking Dolls, in which Leloup and her colleagues speak out about the modeling business.
Harpeer's Bazaar magazine compiled six harsh truths about Leloup from behind the scenes.
Every season starts from scratch.
Even if you posed in top-notch designer outfits last season, the new season starts with casting again.
And every season, there are new, fresh faces in the business, competing for jobs with the tough guys.
Models rarely have a place to call home.
The work is a constant journey, and it can last for years, with the model staying in a hotel room or apartment.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be unbearably difficult.
New York and Paris are desirable places to work, but they're the most stressful.
There's not just one kind of thinness.
You know, an agent in New York might ask you to lose weight, but in Paris, they'll say you're too thin.
Getting a job is always a gamble.
At fashion weeks, models and designers are together all the time, and they act as a support network.
When the fashion weeks are over, the breakup is a pain.
Models are attracted to the industry because of the opportunities it offers, but they are plagued by the idea that everyone thinks the job is just a showcase.
Models like to have their own personalities.
It makes models feel like they're actors with a role.
But you can also express yourself in the work of a model.
The models at the Tory Burch show last night.
New York City is currently hosting Fashion Week, where designers will reveal their lineup for next year.
Roope Salminen , who has changed his style , plays the most unknown of the ApuLanta musicians .
Roope Salminen plays Antti Lautala, a founding member of the band, in the film based on the early years of the band.
Lautala formed Apulanna in 1991 with Toni Wirtas, but left the band in 1994.
I mean, this is a pretty big challenge for me because I'm a rap artist who's about to turn 26, and in this movie, I'm playing a 16-year-old guitarist, Salmine Laughs.
I've always been reluctant to meet the real Ant before the shoot because I want to make him my interpreter.
Antti is obviously more unfamiliar to people than that group, so I think it's okay to just learn his playing style from video.
I don't want to make an imitation of a human.
A man who trusts the empty Roope Salminen and the Dogs will not be cast.
Punk manners come naturally to a man.
I'm sure many of you saw a preview of the punk era of Stars, Stars, and if you've ever been to one of our shows, you've seen a preview.
We've never been a little show, but we always go full.
The cast of the film "You made us beautiful" directed by Tuukka Temese, who played bass in the band from 1993 to 2004, was announced today.
The core of the band, which has become familiar to the public, is performed by young actors who are still relatively unknown to the general public.
Drummer Sipe Santapukkia is played by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirtsa Tatu Sinisalo and bassist Tuukka Temosta Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a hint of her upcoming bust last night when she shared on Snapchat that she was mysteriously preparing for the most important day of her career.
Roope posted a picture of his new look on Instagram yesterday, which he had to implement for the film.
Roope, seen earlier with a mustache and chin chin, has shaved his face silky and dyed his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: This is how you tell your children about refugees
In recent days, many parents have had to wonder how to tell their children about the situation of refugees trying to reach Europe.
Or is it worth telling at all?
There is no need to force the issue, advises psychologist Ferdinand Garoff, a member of the SPR crisis team.
Younger children should be protected, for example, by not letting them watch the news alone.
Young children may not always understand what they see, and it can be a memory and a source of anxiety, he says.
However, if a child has seen news reports about refugees on television or has heard about them elsewhere, it is worth discussing.
It is good to talk about the child's points of view and to listen carefully to what he asks.
A child's fears can be surprising.
They may not be the ones that a parent imagines he fears.
You don't want to scare a child for no reason, even if it's scary and scary.
A younger child closely observes the behavior of his parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the discussion, the child will feel safe too.
Older children are more likely to encounter discussions about refugees at school, with friends, or online.
If the child is concerned, parents do well to discuss the matter with them.
The fact is, not all people in the world are doing well.
Parents and children can discuss how our family will handle this.
But in the end, do we feel that the world is a safe place or an unsafe place?
Parents may also have different parenting views - some may want to protect their children from anxiety where possible.
On the other hand, if difficult matters are discussed in the family, the child will have a model for dealing with the challenges of life ahead.
This could be useful to him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your children to help the weak"
Your own power at the end?
You can still be a good parent to your child
The ball of smoke that hits Vermillion is hard to contain
The North Pole was able to finish the attack of the Apilan Ball Ice in mid-summer.
It was racking up wins and second places until it collapsed at the end of July at the Tampere rave.
When the stallion froze to the bottom, the trainer suspected something was wrong and ordered his protégé a time with the vet.
The explanation for the blackout came up during surveillance.
The horse had strep throat.
The disease was not a mild one, but it required two courses of medication to conquer it.
Since Apilan Balloslama had to be lightly exercised, Pohjola says that she was positively surprised by the horse's last run.
It was the second SE strike in Turku in record time after Taruntuli.
The Apilan Balloslama was under a lot of pressure after a break, having been able to run normally for only a few weeks.
Given these things, the slight slump at the end was understandable, says Pohjola.
Coach assumes a good competition gave the stallions a kick in the pants.
The horse's gait must have gone on, and hopefully it would have evened out.
The Apilans have been the so-called horses of humour.
If he's not entertained, he could have been fat without getting sick.
On a good day, however, the bulls have been struck by lightning that has amazed their opponents.
At low speed, the rivals cannot match the Ball-Slam, which even warm-blooded riders can ride.
The North's hopes are in Vermont for a peasants' run.
But it's a different matter how the Apilans' Ball-Slam agrees to it.
It's kind of hard when you're leaving and you might even get stuck under the bumper of the car and stuff.
I hope the stallion is calmer than when Turku left.
Apilan Balloslama, when he's fit, can also come from the bow, and we're going to drive it to win, the coach promises.
This is why you can 't get rid of useless iPhone apps .
It's the CEO of Apple, Tim Cook.
At least some of the apps that come with Apple's iPhones may be removed at some point in the future - but not all of them.
Apple may be planning to remove some of its own apps from iPhone phones in the future, CEO Tim Cook told Buzzfeed.
Apple's iPhone has a number of applications that are relatively unused: FaceTime calls, newsstands, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts and Vinkes come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is the Apple Watch, which came as a mandatory update for iPhones, although it is only necessary for Apple smartwatch owners.
Cook says removing Apple's software is more complicated than it looks.
Some of the apps are linked to something else on the iPhone.
If they are removed, it could cause problems elsewhere on the phone, Cook tells Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which of Apple's iPhone apps work seamlessly with other applications.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So over time, I think we can develop a way to let the user delete them, Cook added.
Cook says Apple is investigating the matter because it doesn't want to waste memory on people's iPhones.
Inflation in the euro area fell to 0.1% in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only marginally in August, by 0.1% year on year, the EU statistical office Eurostat reported today.
The price increases were driven down by the fall in energy prices.
Eurostat thus revised slightly downwards its forecast of 0.2% a few weeks ago.
In July, the inflation rate was 0.2%.
So-called core inflation fell to 0.9% in August from 1.0% in July.
Eurostat forecast for underlying inflation was 1.0%.
Energy prices in the euro area were 7.2% cheaper last month than a year ago.
In all 28 EU countries, average inflation was zero in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1%.
The highest increase in consumer prices in the euro area was recorded in Malta in August, at 1.4%.
The lowest inflation rate in the price downturn was 1.9% in Cyprus.
In Finland, inflation was negative 0.2% according to the EU harmonised price index.
Euro area inflation remains firmly behind the European Central Bank's (ECB) target of a moderate rise in prices of 2%.
The ECB forecasts inflation in the euro area to average 0.1% this year.
The rise will pick up to 1.1% next year, the central bank forecast in its new inflation forecast published in early September.
The Fed is now trying to tighten monetary policy.
The next recession in the United States will begin at its fastest in less than a year, but more likely in three years, after the Fed raises interest rates for the first time in a long time.
And the downturn in the financial markets starts before the next recession.
The Fed has hinted that it will start raising rates possibly as early as this week and no later than the end of the year.
So the next recession could hit at its fastest by next autumn and the financial markets before that.
Or at least that's what will happen if the world's largest economy and financial market continues to operate as it has been doing and if it reacts to the Fed's blackmail of money-sharks as it has in the past.
This is the conclusion reached by market research strategists Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker of Deutsche Bank in London in their extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank distributed a 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study to its international large clients last week.
The strategists who produced the study and report do not believe they know exactly when the Fed will raise rates or what will happen to the economy and markets afterwards.
Instead, they use the cold facts and calculations of economic statistics to show how the economy and markets have behaved in the past, during and after the Fed rate hikes.
In addition to historical observations, they look at what key economic and financial market variables are now in the same or different patterns as during previous rate hikes - and what the possible consequences are.
It is clear that both the economy and financial markets are now in a better position to withstand rising interest rates than at any time since the 1950s.
The recession may not even begin in a year.
Throughout the summer and early autumn, the Fed's monetary policy and adjustment leaders have been signaling that the time is ripe for interest rates to rise.
The first interest rate hike in over nine years could be this week.
The matter will be resolved between Wednesday and Thursday when the Fed's so-called Open Market Committee meets to decide at its two-day meeting.
The Fed last raised its so-called Fed funds rate in June 2006.
This was the end of a series of relatively regular but small 0.25 percentage point rate hikes over two years, with the Fed raising its interest rate from 1.25 to 5.25 percent.
The financial market syndrome began in 2007 with the problems of the most risky housing finance in the United States, and a year later the financial crisis erupted into a global doomsday nightmare.
The Great Recession hit in 2009.
The last time the serious setbacks in financial markets and the real economy started were slower than has typically happened since the previous Fed rate hikes.
Accordingly, the trials were then more severe and severe than at any time since the depression of the 1930's.
Deutsche strategists have screened the ups and downs of the world's largest economies and the financial market ups and downs since 1950 and in some places since the early 19th century.
They've been talking about Fed interest rate hikes and their economic and financial implications since the 1950s.
The fastest time since the first rate hike to the onset of recession has been less than a year, most often less than three years and on average less than three and a half years.
The rise in the price of the financial markets has ended within a year or two of the beginning of the Fed's interest rate hikes.
The Fed has raised and lowered its policy rate in successive cycles since the early 1950s.
Each time has varied somewhat and the rates are relatively low, so that no definitive conclusions can be drawn from them on the effects of subsequent interest rate increases.
As the strategists remind us, this time around, many things are different.
And not just better.
Interest rates too low for too long
Decades of research may not be enough to uncover the root causes of the financial crisis and the culprits.
But three things about the causes of the crisis and its destructive power are probably fairly clear:
1) The Fed, the euro area ECB and the other major central banks of the world kept their key interest rates too low for too long in the 21st century.
They were patching up the tech bubble while growing the next one.
(2) The already excessive debt accumulation over decades in the various sectors of the financial and real economies was exacerbated by the impact of monetary policy on central bank surpluses.
The biggest debt bubble in economic history was born.
3) The almost unrestrained inflow of cheap debt financing into the financial economy in particular led to the biggest price bubbles in the history of most financial markets, from stocks to real estate, bonds and commodities.
It is hardly hard to argue that the financial markets, which had soared to new heights on the back of ever more complex debt levers, were in an unusually dangerous and volatile situation when the Fed and other central banks last raised rates.
The valuation bubbles, which were based on leveraged financial structures, only lasted after interest rates had started to rise and the cost of debt financing had started to rise.
The risks were realised in the financial crisis, which was followed by a major recession.
Bigger bubble and more debt
Deutschen strategists do not predict what will happen next, but give reason for speculation by mentioning, for example, the following:
1) The Fed and other major central banks have now kept monetary policy in a more relaxed alignment for even longer than before the financial crisis.
If before the crisis interest rates were too low for too long, they have now been lower for even longer.
(2) For a long time, borrowing has not been as cheap as it was ten years ago, but now at its lowest, it is literally cheaper than paying off debt.
Thus, the debt burden on the financial and real economies has not been eased but is now much higher in different sectors than at any time before or since the financial crisis.
(3) The liquidity from central banks, which has become more liquid and cheaper, has remained for the most part in financial markets, pushing the key asset classes to their highest levels since the pre-crisis peak or ever.
Not only do strategists ease the mood with warning signs from financial markets but they also point out that even the U.S. economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and the worst recession in decades to the extent that it has in the past.
The euro area economy has barely recovered.
The real economy is in unusually weak shape, but accordingly financial market pressures and risks are far greater than before the financial crisis, as the Fed tighten its monetary policy next.
Perhaps the future picture of Albert Edwards, strategist at the French bank Société Générale, is not as strange as it may suddenly seem.
He has been training the Bank's international investment clients for a long time on the following full-time Fed roles:
First the Fed raises rates, then the financial bubbles burst, and soon it's time for the Fed to rush to put out the financial bubbles with even bigger strikes of QE.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), a computer and printer company, plans to cut as many as 33,000 jobs.
Most of the reductions are for HP's corporate services business, the company said.
In November, HP will split into Hewlett Packard Enterprises, a company focused on corporate sales, and HP Inc., a company focused on consumer PCs and printers.
HP's workforce peaked in 2011 when it had 350000 employees.
In October last year, the staff was reduced to 302,000.
The company records a one-off cost of USD 2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion) for the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprises is cutting 25,000 to 30,000 jobs.
The consumer deductions will remain at 3300 over three years.
HP intends to move its operations to low-cost countries so that 60% of its workforce will be in low-cost countries by 2018.
The company claims that it has already balanced its business so that no longer any of its customers accounts for more than 10% of its operating profit.
In the second year, its three largest customers accounted for 65 percent of its revenue.

General: Minister Berner has served on the board of a tax haven company
The Commission has also adopted a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
According to Yle, the company's operations are linked to so-called tax planning.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided whether the contested tax ruling is compatible with the internal market.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner remains officially a member of the Board.
Berner himself says he resigned in May.
I checked it out, and all I have to do is leave a notice of termination.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains happen on the agreed schedule, Berner says in an interview with Yle.
Membership after merger
The Luxembourg company manages the holdings of the Swedish company Kährs.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer that merged with Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner served on the board of Karelia-Upofloor from 2010 to 2013 and, after the merger, on the board of Kährs and the Luxembourg company.
According to Yle, Kährs' holdings in Luxembourg are managed through a multi-tiered ownership structure.
Berner tells Ylle that he accepted a board membership in the Luxembourg company at the request of the second largest owner of Kährs.
This is owned by Hartwall Capital.
I've been on the board of Karelia-Upofloor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was looking for a partner, and they found him in Sweden.
This company was owned by a private investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my job was to ensure that the interests of the Finnish family company's capital were realised.
It is important that we ensure that the capital gains of our Finnish companies are taxed in Finland and that starting point was secured in this context, says Berner.
Berner tells Ylee that Hartwall Capital's holdings in the company are not tax-planned.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure of the tax havens is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs, the Triton capital fund, already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for the holdings.
Espoo opens a company-run reception centre
Espoo Otaniemi opens the first company-run reception centre for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take in the first 100 residents starting tonight at 6pm.
The number of seats can grow to 300-400 people within a week.
The Immigration Service is setting up a reception centre on the former Salvation College property.
The activities are carried out by Luona Oy, which is mainly engaged in the provision of healthcare and nursing services.
The City of Espoo, the Immigration Service and Luona Oy agree together on security arrangements for the centre.
The SPC prepares an alternative workplace extortion package
The SPCA is preparing an alternative package to the government's blackmail of working people.
The organisation also wants other employee centres to join.
According to the chairman, Antti Palola, the focus is on Friday's demonstration.
Alternative means of reducing the cost of labour are then reviewed.
"Everyone understands that life goes on after Friday", Palola told reporters during a break from the organization's board meeting.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of education and training.
The economists at STTK have calculated that the change protection provided by the government's competitiveness package will cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million, while the other half of the package is EUR 2 700 million.
I don't know if there's a huge enthusiasm on either side to have a conversation when there's a one-to-one ratio on the other side.
Palola: Negotiating contacts were constructive
The Commission has also been asked to provide a list of the Member States which are to be included in the new programme.
Palola did not comment on whether the timetable was realistic.
Palola said that there is a dialogue with the government and that it has always been constructive.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
The organization requires the government to withdraw from mandatory legislation, which would be implementing some of the extortion.
According to Palola, the STTK is not keen on the preparation of an alternative package with the SDP, which raised the issue.
Employees will gather in Helsinki on Friday to protest the government's blackmail package for working life.
The package includes cutting first-day sick pay, halving overtime pay, reducing Sunday pay to 75% and shortening holidays.
The STC emphasises that the central organisations have invited employees to demonstrate and that the strike was not intended.
Fjäder of Akavan thanks you
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of energy.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of education and training.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of education and training.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should take a decision on the application of the new rules.
The Commission has also been asked to submit proposals for a new directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
We want immigration and working-time banks.
Akava said on Wednesday it had been preparing its own proposal for a long time, in which it was ready to negotiate the government's goal of 5% competitiveness as an alternative to cuts.
The Akva has always been open to negotiation and we have been writing alternative models for the government's proposals for a long time.
We're prepared to consider the terms of your employment as part of the contract.
In return, we want change protection and working time banks, says President Sture Fjäder.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of energy.
Without the SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together to produce a model that will be useful to the government and employers", says Fjäder.
The Aqaba Working Committee will meet on Thursday at 3 p.m. to decide on the possible content of the agreement.
"Same boat, coal, houses" playing bingo with the Sparrow talking tonight
Green Left at the University of Tampere
The green left of the University of Tampere, Viva bingo ticket for the evening.
Prime Ministers have previously made extraordinary speeches during the Mäntsälä rebellion and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä will speak to the nation on the state of the Finnish economy on Yle channels on Wednesday evening at 21.05.
To find a similar speech by a previous prime minister, one must go back to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was prime minister and delivered the famous radio speech that marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
After that, the president and ministers made several radio speeches during the Winter and postwar years.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a New Year's speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the strike of the railway workers with a televised speech.
A private call, monarchist thoughts.
Sparrow's speech has been a source of criticism and speculation all day about what's to come.
The chairman of the Left Alliance, Paavo Arhinmäki, said on Twitter that "Sipilä could make his State of the Nation speech in parliament as a prime minister's announcement, which would also allow for discussion".
The Green Party's Ville Niinistö said: "The one-on-one has already been seen.
Leadership is about dialogue, about listening to people.
SDP's Erkki Hakim condemned on Facebook that "monarchist thinking: the prime minister tells the people what is best for them".
The European Parliament has also voted to approve the Commission's proposal to increase the number of EU citizens in the EU.
Not a single appearance by the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
I tried to.
What is @leaderspin afraid of?
Public service
According to the Cabinet Office, Sipilä's speech is pre-recorded and lasts about 15 minutes.
According to the SAK, the report was commented on live by the SAK's chairman, Lauri Lyly, and the EC's CEO, Jyri Häkämies.
The General Assembly has been criticized for the speech of Sipila.
We considered the matter and concluded that it was part of the public service's duty to promote publicity throughout Finland", says Ismo Silvo, Director of Publications at Yle.
♪ Like we were in the time of the Tammeloos ♪
The speech has also been ridiculed.
When evening comes, dinner is enjoyed in good time, children are combed and dressed in their best.
Mommy puts on a nicer headdress and Dad fits a tie around her neck.
At nine o'clock, the TV is silenced like in the old days of We the Tammeloids", writes blogger Saku Timonen.
"Does Prime Minister Sipilä also explain in his speech why the Finnish government is full of millionaires hiding their capital in tax havens, who draft amnesty laws for their fellow tax evaders and at the same time tell the people that they have to cut when the government runs out of money?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
One guess about what Sipilä says is that the green leftist Viva of Tampere University is doing it.
He's posted a Facebook post about the bingo game.
Tonight, we're gonna hear about the same boat, the same coal, living in debt and the same team spirit.
Coupons and pens ready, at 21:05 it starts and the channels are TV1, Radio Finlandia and Yle Arena.
Ahtisaari in the Guardian: Western countries reject Russian proposal to remove al-Assad
More than three years ago, the West rejected a Russian offer to force Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down, President Martti Ahtisaari told the Guardian.
According to the Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador to the UN proposed a plan to remove Assad from power in style after a while.
The Western countries, however, did not accept the proposal because they believed that al-Assad would fall in a matter of weeks anyway.
In 2012, the Republic of Azerbaijan discussed the Syrian crisis with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to the report, the Russian ambassador, Vitali Tshurkin, outlined a three-point plan for the two-way conversation: the opposition must not be armed, the opposition and Assad must be able to talk immediately, and Assad's abdication must be carried out in a restrained manner.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not always agree on everything, but we can have an open discussion.
I told him what I was doing there and he said, "Sit down, Marty, and I'll tell you what we need to do", Ahtisaari recalls in an interview with the Guardian.
Diplomats are not commenting .
The archipelago says it has passed on Tshurkin's message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing has happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the conversation, but Ahtisaari said it was not a two-word conversation.
UN diplomats also declined to comment on Ahtisaari's claims, but said that al-Assad's forces had already committed several massacres by that time and that key opposition groups rejected any agreements that would have allowed him to remain in power.
The European Union is also calling on the United States to take a more active role in the fight against terrorism.
Officially, Russia has been supporting al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari's claim is that Tshurkin spoke on behalf of Moscow.
If he had told me about the speech by Mr Tshurkin, I would have said that I wanted to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so that I could take it seriously.
Jenkins said he would have suspected that Putin's trick was to keep power in the hands of some al-Assad supporter.
The flood of refugees is our own doing.
The European Union is also calling for a comprehensive reform of the internal market.
The UN estimates that the death toll exceeded 220,000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is our own doing.
I see no choice but to take good care of these poor people.
"We are now paying a bill that we ourselves have caused", Ahtisaari tells the newspaper.
Asylum seekers' centre on the move to Tornio
The Asylum Seeker's Centre planned by the Government for Northern Finland is likely to be established in Tornio.
The centre would be set up in the centre of the city in an empty building in the Tornio community centre.
The Ministry of the Interior has been looking for a suitable location to better control the flow of refugees across the Swedish border.
Helsinki's Sanomat reported on Tuesday that the city council had already decided to submit a school building as a replacement for the ministry.
According to Sauli Hyöppinen (left), vice-chairman of the Tornio city council, this is not true.
"We have to make sure that the people who are in charge of the project are aware of the importance of the project and that they are aware of the importance of the project", he said.
The debate was attended by 36 of the 43 delegates.
The 13 delegates from the Planning Centre opposed the proposal.
On that basis, one might expect the decision to be positive, says Hyöppinen.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was notified on Monday and the matter was quickly resolved.
The EU could accommodate around 500 asylum seekers at a time.
An expert has been to check that it could be used for this purpose.
The location is a few hundred meters from the border, so it would work in that sense too, says Nousiainen.
The European Union is still hoping for an alternative to blackmail
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilän (center), halving the public holiday pay would only cover part of the government's aim to lower the price of work.
He also said that the government would welcome an alternative package if the social partners could agree on it.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
He also did not know how seriously the organizations were looking for alternatives to the government-reported blackmail of working people.
If such an agreement is reached, we will certainly welcome it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä's view, halving holiday allowances would be a viable option, since it would affect almost all employees, unlike, for example, the government's planned cut in Sunday lunches.
The labour market organisations could agree on a reduction in holiday pay because it is written into collective agreements rather than law.
The government will present these prospects to parliament next Wednesday in a Cabinet statement on the workplace blackmail.
The Sparrow says the proposals of the organizations should be known before this.
This is not the final backstop either.
The legislative work then starts, the train is in motion and it gets harder and harder.
It's a good time.
It doesn't take long for things like this to happen if you have the will.
The list published by the government last week includes the conversion of the weekend and the Thursday into unpaid holidays without reducing annual working time.
In addition, first-day sick pay will be cut, overtime pay will be halved, Sunday pay will be cut to 75 percent and holidays will be shortened.
The reforms are being implemented as mandatory legislation bypassing trade unions, which has attracted strong criticism.
The workers' organizations are organizing a protest on Friday in response to the measures, and several unions have declared political strikes.
The Tohma lake council approved the expansion of the hops warehouse
The council of Tohmajärvi approved the expansion of the Nordic Koivu Oy's warehouse, or hops hall, which was unanimously but slightly grumpy.
The criticism was that the project was larger and more expensive than originally discussed.
I'm also a little busy.
It was a little surprising that the need for space was not known a year ago when the decision was taken on the previous extension.
At this stage, the expansion of the warehouse by 400-450 square metres was approved in the investment programme, but the amount will be decided later in the interim report.
The agenda still mentioned an investment of EUR 150 000-200 000 but at the meeting the technical director Erkki Ikonen said that the estimated cost would be EUR 300 000.
The investment was supported on the basis that it would bring jobs and tax revenue to the local community.
The municipality is not at risk, as the company pays the investment as rent, Vesa Väistö (PS.) argued.
The Karelian language has a place in the River Danube
The city government softened its previously tough stance to bring street signs in the Karyansk language into downtown Joensuu.
The new decision is important and right in terms of preserving the cattle tradition throughout the province.
The river river is not declared the capital of the Kareli language because it has no historical basis and the Kareli language is not an inherent part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the Rijksregion has been more of an Eastern Savoy dialect.
Even after the new decision, there will be no street signs in the city center in the Krei-Futan language.
However, the city of Joensuu is also prepared to use the Karelian language, for example, in information boards and tourism marketing.
The same approach is recommended by the city to all other operators.
Although Joensuu is officially a monolingual municipality, it is also worth taking a more open-minded approach to the use of the Karelian language now that multiculturalism is alive and changing strongly in North Karelia.
The language of Karelia is still a feature of the province, as is the image of Joensuus as the forest capital of all Finland.
Both can be put to good use in the province's various marketing activities.
The closure of the railway lines is cutting the province's vitality.
The cuts to the railroad are a major blow to the province's vitality.
The transport links have a direct impact on the economy and competitiveness of the province.
And that will affect whether it is even possible to live and work here, wonders Joensuu Mayor Kari Karjalainen.
He also mentions air transport, which has also been the subject of several reports.
It is important for the whole province that our ability to cope is not diminished by government measures, as is happening now.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of energy.
The deterioration of transport links poses an additional challenge to the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here, such as transport links and housing, the easier it is to get students and workers, says Jukka Mönkkönen, rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor transport links also affect the research staff, who are highly mobile and travel extensively for research.
The recruitment manager, Marko Junkkarinen, says that it is already difficult to market the university in western Finland because of poor transit links in the transverse direction.
Currently, about half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland come from outside Eastern Finland.
Some 10-20% of them are from the New World, partly because of the direct train connection.
From the river , I 've become one of the voice of the Sioux War .
The view of the Rijksmuseum about the Siun Sotte project is apparently unanimous, but there is one voice among the voices.
City councillor Pentti Keskisalo (Sd., pictured) proposed abandoning the entire project at a council meeting on Monday, but his proposal was rejected as unprofitable.
The Council approved the proposal for a decision by Mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be reviewed in early October before the meeting of the City Council, which will give its final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train from the Eagle to Kouvola will be out next year .
Passenger trains will continue to run from the city of Orkney to Kouvola, although at a reduced number of stops.
Passenger train services between the Eagle and Kouvola will be changed in March.
One train pair is left out, but still five times a day from the Eagle to Kouvola and vice versa.
The contractions are due to government austerity measures.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications' purchase allocation for rail transport for the next four years will be reduced by EUR 12,3 million.
The quietest routes will be completely cut off.
The VC will draw up new timetables by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed up on the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys slipped out.
The rescue team let a 12-year-old climb onto the roof from a spire, but he couldn't get off on his own.
The incident occurred on Tornion Mountain Ketot Road at approximately 6:30 on Tuesday night.
There is an old two-story wooden house with no ladder to the roof.
That did not stop a group of boys from climbing up the roof of the house over the amateur radio mast next to it.
The other boys got down the same route, but one didn't.
As a result, the others slipped away, and passersby alerted the rescue team to help lift the last one on the roof safely back to the surface.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any comments from interested parties.
FedEx reported a weak quarterly earnings report, with the transportation sector still weakened its full-year earnings forecast due to lower demand for freight services and higher costs of ground transportation.
The company plans to hire 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
This time last year, FedEx announced it was hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The company's stock fell about 2.5% 45 minutes before the actual opening of trading on Wednesday.
FedEx is forecasting $10.40 to $10.90 for the fiscal year ending May, down 20 cents from the previous forecast.
According to FactSet's research, analysts were forecasting $10.84.
The forecast has weakened despite price increases of 4.9% on average, which will take effect on 4 January and additional charges for heavy or bulky goods in November.
The company still expects earnings to increase from the previous year, thanks to cost cuts, higher sales and growth in online sales.
Fred Smith, chairman and chief executive officer, said the company had performed well ahead of expectations in a weaker economic environment, which has particularly tested production and global trade.
The announcement of the seasonal workers' hiring plans came a day after competitor UPS announced its plans to hire approximately the same number of seasonal workers as last year, i.e. 90 00095 000 people.
For the quarter ended 31 August, FedEx's operating profit was $692 million, an increase of 6%.
Earnings per share were $2.42 which is a drop from the $2.44 forecast of 12 analysts at Zacks Investment Research.
Revenue increased by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research said that the company was expected to generate $12.23 billion in sales.
FedEx has been undergoing a decline in international first class shipments in recent years, which has led to the suspension of its Express business.
The strong growth in online sales has been confirmed by the performance of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the turnover of land transport increased by 29%, but the operating profit reflected the increased costs of large shipments and insurance.
Express unit was more profitable due to higher base charges, while freight business decreased due to higher labour costs.
About an hour before actual trading opened, FedEx's stock had fallen $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, the stock closed down 11% from the year-over-year average and 17% below its all-time high on June 11.
This week, the Fed's board of governors is meeting for the most anticipated meeting in years, sitting around a 30-foot-wide wooden table in Honduras to decide if it's time to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
The wall of the central bank's ornate two-story conference room is adorned with a magnificent mural depicting the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues must put the financial interests of the state above all other interests.
The Fed has a two-fold mandate from Congress: maximize employment in the United States and keep prices here stable.
However, since the Great Depression, the central bank's management has noted a third unwritten mandate: financial stability.
This mandate may be missing in a painful decision, as the Fed is due to announce on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to begin a reversal of the unforeseen stimulus provided by short-term interest rates that have held near zero since late 2008.
While most data indicate that the economy is growing steadily, the recent financial market turmoil may well prompt cautious central bank officials to fear increased volatility by raising the federal reference rate of tax by  even a quarter of a percentage point.
"The labor market and inflation are of course the first and most important in their practical monitoring", says Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the banking firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"However, I believe that if the central bank is looking for an excuse not to raise taxes, the increased uncertainty in global markets is enough to make it wait", Piegza continues.
The central bank's intentions are not agreed upon by those who are considering the matter, which in itself is a source of nervousness.
About half of the economists surveyed by Bloomberg said they expected interest rates to rise this week.
However, the financial markets expect the central bank to be waiting and the key indicator is only a 30% chance of a rise.
If the central bank raises its key interest rate, stock prices may fall unless policy makers soften the blow by promising another hike.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 228.89 points, or 1.4 percentage points, to 16,599.85.
"The reason for the flare-up was expectations that the central bank would keep the key interest rate stable this week", said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the central bank raised rates at this stage", he said.
"If this were to happen, the central bank would have to think carefully about how to keep the hands of financial market participants steady".
Another expert concluded that raising interest rates could calm financial markets and remove uncertainty about when the central bank would act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed inclined to raise rates by 0.25 percentage points this month, a first small step in tightening financial conditions and thereby strengthening the US recovery.
The Commission has also proposed that the Council should adopt a common position on the proposal for a directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling of foodstuffs.
Although job creation slowed in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 percent last month, now at its lowest level in seven years and close to what the central bank calculates as full employment.
The payroll seems to be picking up .
Although inflation continued to fall below the central bank's annual 2% target, central bank policymakers stated that the main reason for this was the temporary impact of the sharp rise in oil prices.
"The economy can and needs to cope with higher interest rates, as long as they take into account the tight labour market", said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world were not shocked last month when China deregulated its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as 16 percentage points from a record high in May, and investors feared that the Chinese recession would also affect global growth.
Markets have picked up this month, and the Dow Jones is now down almost 10 percent from its May peak.
The market turmoil means that central bank decision-makers will find it even more difficult to consider raising the key interest rate.
"The central bank's work is becoming more complicated despite what happened in financial markets and the news of the Chinese economic slowdown in recent weeks", said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior researcher and former central bank official at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate.
Now he believes the central bank will wait at least a month to be able to deal with the effects.
"There is a great deal of uncertainty about the impact on the US economy, and there is little reliable information on the situation following recent developments in the Chinese economy", Oliner said.
The recovery of the global economy is not the central bank's main concern and should therefore in principle not influence its decision-making.
In practice, however, the central bank is the most influential force in the world's monetary system.
The central bank's influence over the past few years has been enormous.
In 2013, the mere suggestion by then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanke that the central bank might scale back its operations caused a worldwide upheaval.
In today's interconnected world of markets and economies, the central bank is required to monitor global trends and to liaise with other central banks and experts in order to have a good overall picture of the world economy.
"The decision-making process of the central bank is more an art than a science", said Zachary Karabell, global strategy manager at Envestnet Inc., a money management firm.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Richmond Regional Bank, said this month that the central bank has overreacted in the past to movements in financial markets that do not seem to be linked to the fundamental pillars of the economy.
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, has called for a hike in the key interest rate, citing the decisions taken in 1998 and 1999.
"The Asian financial crisis led the central bank to decide in three meetings to lower the key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points, despite only limited identifiable consequences for U.S. growth", Lacker said.
A year later, the central bank reversed the decision.
"The central bank should only prioritize monetary stability in a major crisis, such as the 2008 crash", said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate committee.
The latest wave is not even close to that", he said.
"There is absolutely no need to fear a rate hike because of market upheaval", added Posen of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
"The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and it doesn't mention monetary stability, and until this changes, I don't think we should get ahead of ourselves".

Association of Pediatricians of Rio Grande, Brazil, promotes a healthy diet for breast-feeding infants
The Brazilian Association of Pediatricians of Rio Grande, SPRS, has developed a dazzling way to teach breast-feeding women the importance of a healthy diet by showing them pictures of babies being breast-fed with pictures of unhealthy food painted on them.
Human breast milk is made up of proteins, fats, vitamins, and carbohydrates, which provide the baby with all the nutrients he needs and enable him to develop a strong immune system.
Because of the extra energy consumption, pregnant women are advised to add about 500 kilograms [500 lb] of calories to their daily intake.
The new study suggests that in addition to increasing calorie intake, other dietary changes should be made.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, revealed that a healthy diet of a pregnant woman can affect the genes of her baby and protect the baby from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on the child's immune system.
Seven Sunrises has the most viewers, even though Nine is trying to get a lead on their Today Show.
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson have been campaigning in Canberra to make a morning show about the aftermath of the Liberal Party leadership election, but that has not improved Today's ratings much.
The Channel Nine morning show was broadcast from the capital after Malcolm Turnbull ousted Tony Abbott.
The morning program of the rival channel, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was broadcast from London, with week-long specials also broadcast from Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls, and Cancun.
The distance seemed to be of no importance to Australian television viewers, since Sunrise averaged 397,000 viewers in five state capitals and Today 339,000.
The number of viewers increased slightly from 317,000 on Monday and 283,000 on Tuesday, but fell short of 343,000 on Thursday.
Today has been stretching its distance to Sunrise for the past few months.
In August, Today averaged 318,000 viewers, while Sunrises had 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was 40,00050,000 viewers.
In September, Sunrise has averaged 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting event of the morning.
The changes in the winds this morning will affect Parliament more.
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!
The Commission has received comments from interested parties on the measures taken to implement the Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 September 2015 on the financial corrections to be made to the Greek banking system.
A notable new feature on Seven was the 800 Words news series, featuring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama, about a recently widowed father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with his two children, reached a whopping audience of 1,219,000.
Critics have questioned whether Thomson would be a hit single without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
According to last night's ratings, the answer is a clear yes.
The X Factor retained its strong position with 1,136,000 viewers, beating out The Block (838 000) and TBL's Families (726 000).
Seven's The Chase Australia has captured viewers with varying degrees of success.
The first half hour of the new series, presented by Andrew O'Keeffe, averaged 446,000 viewers.
In the second half hour (5:30 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.), the audience increased to 623,000, which was more than Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half of The Chase Australia averaged 520,000 viewers, and the second half drew a whopping 720,000.
The Hot Seat was rated 620,000.
The second night of The Chase Australia showed Channel Nine that Hot Seat will be over by 5:30.
The Chase Australia replaced Million Dollar Minutes, which couldn't challenge McGuire's series.

The final three think Sam Wood is really the bachelor of dreams, but who does he pick?
Did the secret come out?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have inadvertently revealed their choice of the Boyfriend of Dreams.
The final choice of Sam Wood, the bachelor of dreams, has been a closely guarded secret.
The three women who remain don't say a word about who got the last rose from their boyfriend.
We asked Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markos and Lana Jeavons-Fellows about their moods before the three of them were eliminated, and the women may have inadvertently hinted at who would win.
Sam Wood's lips are tightly sealed until Thursday's final.
All three women praised Wood's sense of humor, ambition, family values, positivity, and considered him a suitable partner for their own qualities.
When women were asked who would be the best mate for Wood if the last rose failed to hit their spot, their answers may give clues as to who will take the boyfriend's heart.
The Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as Wood's second best partner.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been smooth sailing since the beginning.
"As soon as I got home, I noticed that Sarah and Sam were getting along very well, and that feeling has persisted throughout the program", Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah has her feet on the ground and is a really fun person to be around", Markoski added.
"I've seen them together, and I have to admit, there's chemistry between them.
They seem like a natural couple.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood are a good couple.
Mackay said he realized at his hometown date last week that Wood might be the one.
"Seeing her with my friends and family made me realize that this is not just a race, and I am now fully committed to our relationship", Mackay said.
When Mackay was asked who Wood would choose if he didn't choose her, she replied puzzledly:
"I can't say", he said.
"I like the other girls just as much as I like Snezana and Lana.
The bachelor of dreams on the Ten Channel Wednesday at 7:30.

Jarryd Hayne has a number of options for starting his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle were all very interested in Hayes after he moved to the States, and several other clubs were also interested in him after an impressive open training day last year.
Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and it looks like the pick is up.
Some coaches would have kept Hayne on the bench, as he did on the Australian rugby team, when he was the back-up quarterback in the 20-3 victory over Minnesota on Tuesday.
Tomsula, however, showed his confidence in Hayne and gave him another chance to return the fly kick.
Tomsula continued his line in the dressing room after the game.
He didn't rob the newcomers in front of the other team. He cheered them on.
Tomsula also publicly defended Hayne at a post-game press conference.
49ers special correspondent Cam Inman reports that Hayne also received encouragement from special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised Hayne to forget about the missed catch and focus on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne is hitting a home run in the first quarter of a game against the Minnesota Vikings.
Hayne and his Australian fans had expected more from a man making his NFL debut.
Hayne left the field after the failure, raining, and later told 2DayFM 104.1 to Hamish and Andy that he could not have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
"These things happen, and you have to move on", Hayne said.
Hayne compared the error to his State of Origin debut in 2007, when his home run opened up a place for Queensland.
But all in all, it was an incredible experience for a 27-year-old.
Hayne posted a picture on Instagram of herself posing with fans and the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin discuss gay rights
In 2003, Russia's richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested at gunpoint at an airport in Siberia.

Four dead after police shot protesters with rubber bullets in Nepal
Four people were killed in southern Nepal, a government source said on Wednesday, when police fired rubber bullets into a crowd protesting the country's alleged new constitution.
The violence occurred on Tuesday evening in the Rupandeh region, less than 300 kilometres from the capital Kathmandu.
According to district governor Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, some throwing stones and firebombs.
Dhakal said police used tear gas and fired into the air before firing rubber bullets.
He said 20 police officers and five civilians were wounded.
It is not entirely clear why rubber bullets, which can kill but are generally considered a less destructive option, suddenly became so deadly.
The clashes were the latest in weeks of protests in the southern plains of Nepal, where the Madhesi tribe said the new provinces based on the new constitution would weaken their political influence.
Protests have also been seen in western Nepal, where the Tharus tribe is demanding their own state.
At least 40 people, 11 of them police, have been killed in violent clashes since August 10th.
The agreement, signed by the four major political parties, to divide the country into provinces is a major step towards a new constitution, but a very sensitive issue in Nepal, where power has been concentrated for centuries.
A new constitution has been in the works since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake killed thousands in April.
Lawmakers have voted on constitutional provisions in Kathmandu this week, and officials say a new constitution could be approved by Sunday.
NHC hurricane center: 60 percent chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde .
A broad area of low pressure about 350 miles [560 km] south of the Cape Verde Islands has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday.
The Miami Meteorological Department also reports a clear low-pressure center between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles, which has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone within the next two days.
Google is going to raise $11 million for refugees .
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced the launch of a campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian aid organizations that help thousands of people across Europe fleeing war and poverty.
Google announced the donation campaign on their blog in a very personal way.
Instead of running the campaign, Google employee Rita Masoud started it by sharing her own experiences.
"We traveled in the dark on trains and buses, and experienced hunger, thirst, cold and fear", Masoud wrote.
I was lucky.
As Europe's refugee and immigrant crisis intensifies, many families in a similar situation are in dire need of help.
Donations are directed to nonprofit organizations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the UN Refugee Agency.
When $5.5 million has been raised through google.com/refugeerelief, Google promises to donate the equivalent amount, bringing the total to $11 million.
The European refugee crisis is the worst since the Second World War, exacerbated in particular by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has forced more than four million people to flee their homes this year.
The war is also forcing people to flee Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Slightly overweight diabetics may benefit from obesity surgery
A new study suggests that mildly overweight type 2 diabetics may benefit from weight loss surgery for at least five years.
However, it is too early to say whether mildly overweight type 2 diabetics live longer after surgery for obesity than those who receive non-surgical treatment.
"It takes time to get the death rate data", said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in obesity surgery, who reported on a new study in JAMA Surgery.
Bariatric surgery, or liposuction, is a procedure used to reduce the size of the stomach.
Surgical procedures reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food into the body.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be an effective treatment for type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted in patients with morbidly obese individuals with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
The weight index shall be reported in relation to the weight and length, with a normal value of 18,524,9.
A BMI over 25 is considered overweight, and a BMI over 30 is a sign of significant obesity.
You can calculate your own body mass index at 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In the new study, researchers at Min-Sheng Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 in a study comparing two methods of weight loss surgery, gastric bypass surgery and sleeve surgery, with medications for type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
After the reduction of obesity, the mean body mass index decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth study year.
The weight index of non-surgical subjects remained at 29.
The total improvement in diabetes in 36 percent of those who had surgery and partial improvement in 28 percent of those who had surgery was also significant.
In the drug-treated group, only 1 percent of the patients had a complete improvement in diabetes and only about 2 percent had a partial improvement.
The study also showed improvements in blood pressure, triglycerides, and bad LDL cholesterol in the surgical group.
The researchers also monitored the patients' haemoglobin A1c levels, which is a measure of how their blood sugar levels have changed.
Researchers say that the recommended level of hemoglobin A1c is less than 7 percent.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level dropped from 9 percent to 6 percent.
In the treatment group, the value remained stable at about 8%.
However, the research team led by Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu found that this did not reduce mortality over five years.
The team also compared the results of two different surgical procedures.
At year five, the weight loss in the abdominal bypass group was greater than in the sleeve group (18.7 and 14.2 kg), the weight loss in the body mass index was greater (7.4 and 5.1), as were the hemoglobin A1c levels (3.1 and 2.1 percent), and the diabetes improvement was also significantly greater in the bypass group (46.9 and 16.7 percent).
The new study could not show a decrease in mortality after five years, but according to a Swedish study by Blackstone of the University of Arizona College of Medicine in Phoenix, surgery adds years to the life span of obese people.
In a Swedish study, obese people who underwent gastric bypass surgery had a 29 percent decrease in mortality over 15 years compared with the group receiving conventional treatment.
Although the new study did not find a lower mortality rate, Blackstone said it did provide evidence that people with a BMI below 35 could benefit from the procedure.
"This is the most important finding of the study, as it shows that surgery is safe in the low-weight group and does not increase the risk of death or kidney disease", Blackstone wrote.
Blackstone says people and doctors should take weight seriously, with a body mass index of 27 to 30.
"We wait too long for people to take the situation seriously", the researcher said.
"When you have a genetic mutation that makes you prone to obesity and diabetes, it's really hard to reverse that".
'Not everyone can come to Europe' Dalai Lama  RT News
The European Union is not able to take in all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for an end to violence in the refugee homelands.
The Dalai Lama addressed the refugee crisis during a visit to the United Kingdom, where he spoke at the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion, an Oxford-based centre for ethical research.
The Dalai Lama says that in the current situation, humanity must be put before individual countries or continents.
He also stressed that while the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was admirable, it was not sufficient in this situation.
"It is impossible to imagine that everyone could come to Europe", the Dalai Lama said in his speech.
The Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to resolve the crisis, but stressed that the solution was only temporary.
"It is a wonderful thing to take care of thousands of refugees, but at the same time it is a matter of thinking about long-term solutions and how we can bring about genuine peace and real development in these Islamic countries, mainly through education", the Dalai Lama stressed.
"Ultimately, we have to think about how we can reduce the killing in these countries.
We need to reduce power consumption.
The EU has a long history of supporting the fight against terrorism.
The Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks and claimed that the use of force in response to the terrorist attack created an uncontrolled chain of events.
"After the attacks of September 11, I offered my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution would come through nonviolence.
I know his intentions were good, but he resorted to force with unpredictable consequences", the Dalai Lama said.
Hand swallowing cases quadrupled in children in four years.
According to the Georgia Poison Control Center, poison centers across the United States report that since 2010, swallowing with handhelds with a high alcohol content has nearly quadrupled among children under 12.
According to Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, reported hand swallowing cases among children under 12 increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"These products are increasingly being available to children, and unfortunately some of them are in the emergency room", Lopez told CNN.
According to Lopez, children drink their hands on purpose, partly to impress their friends and partly because of social media.
You see, there are YouTube videos of teenagers drinking disinfectant for a cheap drink.
Teenagers are reported to mix alcohol-containing mouthwash with disinfectant to make the drink stronger.
Younger children may be attracted to the smell of handcuffs.
"The child does not think the substance is bad", Lopez said.
"Many of the most attractive hand-held products are just scented.
There are handmade products with strawberry, grape, and orange flavors that appeal to children".
The alcohol content of the disinfectants is 45-95%.
Even a small amount can cause alcohol poisoning in young children.
"The alcohol content of the handkerchief is very high", Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Poison Control Center at the University of Kansas Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
"No one would leave a whiskey bottle in the reach of children, but if hand sanitizers are left in the reach of children often, they quickly turn into a large amount of alcohol".
Six-year-old Nhaijah Russell recently had four strawberry-scented hand rubs at school, and the girl was taken to the emergency room.
"The girl's blood alcohol level was 179, which is twice the adult level of intoxication", says Chris Ritchey, a doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Nhaijah was limping and unable to walk when she was brought to the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital for brain damage, as she had fallen and hit her head after drinking alcohol", Ritchey said.
"It was really scary", Nhaijah's mother, Ortoria Scott, told CNN.
My daughter could have died.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use nonalcoholic products and disinfectant towels, and that your hands be kept out of reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing a handkerchief that contained an unreported toxic substance.
The health authorities considered that the product contained lethal methanol instead of ethyl alcohol, although the latter is declared as an active substance in the product specification.
According to a police report, in January three fourth-graders in upstate New York planned to kill a "violent" teacher by placing antibacterial products around the classroom.
The teacher is very allergic to handcuffs and forbade them from being brought into the classroom.
The police considered the failed plan to be meaningless and called for disciplinary action.
Rumor has it there 's no disagreement in the Celtic ranks .
Griffith downplays the Celtic disagreement, while Deila admits that the team is not doing well but believes he can fix the situation.
Hearts are facing off against the SFA on Neilson's penalty kick and Warburton is keeping a lid on January transfers to ensure the team's cohesion is not compromised.
Aberdeen neck to Celtic by five points .
A penalty from Adam Rooney in the first half gave Aberdeen a narrow lead over Hamilton at Pittodrie Stadium, giving them five points to flee from Celtic.
Griffiths is downplaying the dissent .
Griffiths has dismissed rumours of dissent within Celtic's ranks, saying that Griffiths and his team are not under surveillance as they prepare to face the Dutch champion.
"I don't think we're under any pressure, I think the players are looking forward to the game.
The Dutch are missing an old Scottish fighting partner.
Former Rangers midfielder and Dutch international Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because they can no longer watch Celtic and Rangers play each other twice.
De Boer, who works for Ajax's management, said: "The highlights of Celtic's games are no longer shown in the Netherlands.
Because the Rangers are no longer in the game".
"This isn't just about the Rangers coming back.
This is Old Firm.
The Dutch are looking forward to a team-to-team match.
The Old Firm games are a thrill and a thrill beyond Scotland".
I'm going to turn this around, Deila assures me.
RONNY DEILA admits that Celtic are having a tough time, but the Norwegian pilot assures us that things will change.
The team that lost to Malmö were relegated from the Champions League and lost 10 players to Aberdeen, who now have a five-point lead at the top of the table.
"Celtic have had tough times before, and we're going to rise again", Deila said.
"We want to see an improvement in our situation as soon as possible.
The situation is very frustrating, and it causes anger or sadness in many.
We are, too, but we have to move on.
We desperately need the support of Celtic fans, because it's going to make the players stronger.
A spirit of togetherness is really important now".
Warburton is careful with January moves .
Although only a few weeks ago, Rangers manager Mark Warburton hinted at January transfer window, he is wary of the transfer window, saying he wants to jeopardize the team's unity.
"The January transfer window is markedly different from the summer transfer window", said the former Brentford manager.
"The players who join the team in the summer will be able to get used to the team before the start of the season, which has been successful in our lineup this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes unnecessary player acquisitions can do more harm than good to a team".
Celtic 's targeting Michu , considering retirement
Swansea forward Michu has been linked with Celtic in player transfer talks and Michu has hinted at retiring at the end of his contract with the Swans.

Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle .
Griffiths was reprimanded after a man admitted to writing defamatory lyrics about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident happened at a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before Edinburgh's local match at Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a local match and the atmosphere was fierce", said the striker. "I can guarantee I will not go back to Tynecastle unless I am in the Celtic ranks".

Unemployment remains unchanged in Scotland, rising in the British Isles
THE unemployment rate in Scotland remained unchanged in May to 164,000, while the UK unemployment rate rose by 10,000 over the same period.
According to the Office for National Statistics, the unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9%, compared with 5.5% for the whole of the United Kingdom.
The number of people in employment in Scotland is 12 000 less than three months ago, and now stands at 2 612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0% in the quarter, compared with an average employment rate of 73.5% for the whole of the UK.
Commenting on recent figures, David Mundell, Scotland's minister for affairs, said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundation for a strong economy".
Almost exactly a year ago, Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
The labour market situation in Scotland has improved over the past year: unemployment has fallen.
Why am I watching an execution in Oklahoma?
Later today, unless I can find a legal basis to reverse the order, I will see the execution.
If the execution is carried out, which I hope it is not, I will be sitting in the execution chamber of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary while Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
Glossip has asked me to be one of four official witnesses.
In January, I received an invitation from a man's best friend, and despite my shock, I accepted.
As the day approaches, I'm terrified.
Then why did I say yes?
I said yes because I thought it would give me a chance to tell a true story about the death penalty.
It would be a unique perspective.
Reporters will be able to follow executions in the United States, and since there are more applications than places, participants will be chosen by lottery.
Oklahoma has cut the number of press positions from 12 to five.
The chosen ones are watching the execution with moderation.
I can't do that.
I'm sitting here with Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've created a personal relationship with him, because we've spoken on the phone several times over the months, and one of my visits lasted two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
Prison officials say that I cannot be present as a witness or as a reporter, so I am not allowed to bring a notebook and a pen to take notes.
I just have to try to memorize the details.
A reporter from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my integrity.
"The basic idea is this:
When you tell the doomed story in a way that pleases him, you get close to him".
I told the reporter I disagreed.
The reporter admitted that she could have been more careful in the wording, but she still thinks my actions were wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I've said and written.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he tried to tell me, I wouldn't obey.
I've told him he can remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to cover the incident.
If Glossip dies, he believes the publicity will help the anti-death penalty movement.
I'm going to sit next to Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post.
If you want more information on the subject, you can listen to my podcast.
I'm not going to repeat the details in this context.
I can't say that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Treese's murder would make him guilty of aiding and abetting after the crime.
However, I believe it is highly probable that Mr. Glossip was not guilty of murder.
I strongly believe that the evidence was not sufficient to justify the death penalty.
I believe his execution is wrong.
From this perspective, I will be watching his execution.
I can't claim to be completely neutral.
You can read an unbiased account of the events in other journalists' stories.
I'll tell you what it's like to watch a man die for nothing.
The man was lured from the Canning River after a police water chase.
The Canning Valley District Constable stayed dry while luring the man up the Canning River.
The Perth man's attempted escape drove him into shallow, muddy water, and a police officer a few metres away was able to guide him back to dry land.
Canning Valley Police received a call on Tuesday about an unauthorised presence in Beckenham.
Upon arrival, police spotted a suspect trying to evade police by heading to Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"The man standing in the water announced that he would not come out of the water and ordered the police to come in and get him", senior sergeant Shandell Castledine said.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec was not attracted to the wetness of his uniform, so he chose a safer tactic  negotiation.
"Sometimes the escape attempt makes one resort to amusing means", said Sergeant Castledine.
The case of football champion Ben Cousins is a striking example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid police blasting and tried to swim across the Swan River.
The man's enterprise was doomed, but his kidnapping inspired the locals to plan a Ben Cousins Biathlon.
Peter Moody says the reporters tried to spy on him, and he's threatening to quit the race.
Peter Moody accuses the editors of Racing Victoria of attempting to spy on his stables last year, threatening to stop racing immediately.
Moody claims that he has been personally attacked by the editors and the integrity department of Racing Victoria, and the recent rejection of Lady Tata for treatment on race day was the final straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he's always been committed to racing, but he's been in a tough spot since the Lidari sample was found to contain cobalt, and he couldn't explain why.
Moody has kept his tongue in check over the espionage charges for the past year and a half, and he didn't want the charges to affect the actions of a bitter man.
"I didn't want to bring it up, I thought about it for a long time, but sometimes frustration comes out in a flash", Moody said.
"They know what really happened".
"Sometimes you have to react and accept the consequences, and now I have to accept the situation after I opened my mouth.
I'm going home and I'm going to sleep well.
I want to walk upright, and I want the owners of the horses to believe that I'm doing the best I can.
If the owners don't believe in it, I'm not gonna be able to continue as a trainer.
I'd have to think about my future as a licensed coach".
Moody dropped the bomb earlier in an interview with Racing.com, where he talked about the Immigration Department spying on his stable.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Brian Stewart were sitting in the same room and offered a man a job at my stable to spy on me, and I'll give him his name when asked", Moody told Racing.com.
"They clearly believe I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, they'd better produce evidence, because I've never been caught doing anything illegal.
Former RVL Chairman Robert Roulston, current RVL Chairman David Moodie and current RVL CEO Bernard Saundry were aware of the activity then and now.
I'm supposed to think of this as a personal manhunt?
Should RVL take real action and shift responsibility for the situation in the industry to others besides the coaches?
Am I a liability to the industry?
Am I really a liability to the industry?
Maybe a lot of people think so.
Maybe I'll get my coaching license and be pushed out of my job, and I'm sure my words will make a lot of people think that.
But I'm at the point where I don't care anymore.
It's really sad.
I'm pushing them to make their own decisions.
I have my family to support me, and I can retire".
After a lengthy examination of Lidar's cobalt levels and a recent rejection, the coach became so frustrated that he threatened to give up his license.
Moody is best known as the coach of the undefeated champion Black Caviar, who described the race day rule as ridiculous after the horse's legs were illegally covered with a clay coil.
"The treatment is against the rules.
I take full responsibility for that", Moody said.
"A member of my staff mistakenly put mud on the horse's leg.
I could have done the mud painting last night.
It could have been done yesterday afternoon, and it was.
But it happened on race day".
Moody faces a three-month ban for unregulated clay treatment, which the organizers are now investigating.
"This is a joke.
The rules were written by someone who knows nothing about horses.
Everyone understands that rules are needed, but this has gone too far", Moody said.
We have a fugitive from the scene of the Cobra crash.
Police have arrested a cyclist who crashed into a man who fled the scene of the accident over the weekend.
The cyclist was taken by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, where he suffered serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police say the man in the car fled the scene and did not stay to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia turned himself in to Shepparton Police.
The man is likely to face charges of failing to stop and assist in a traffic accident and other traffic offences.
The 40-year-old cyclist from Cobram is still in hospital and is in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy is making a point of pointing to the opponents' fight rhetoric on the sidelines.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy sees criticism of his team's tackling as a deliberate act in the NRL's two league cups.
According to Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson, the judges awarded the Storm's lead to the Melbourne hosts for winning the qualifier in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett barely covered up the reference to the Storm after the Broncos beat the Queensland Cowboys in the quarterfinals on Saturday night, calling the game a mock-up and saying that Queensland doesn't care much about the batting.
Bellamy defended his team's tackling game, saying they were just focused on contact when they were tackling.
Bellamy added that his confidence in his team was heightened by the criticism of his team by the coaches of the two top teams, which Bellamy saw as a sign that the coaches were worried about losing to the Storm.
"This issue always comes up, and as I recall, Trent Robinson didn't talk about hitting anything when his team beat us 24-2", Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can assure you, we haven't changed anything in our defensive systems or our techniques all year, and for the past six weeks, we've been focused on contact play and tackling, which has turned us upside down.
Trent has been in charge for three years, and the loss may have been a shock to him because he has a great team that's not used to losing.
It's funny, the same thing always comes up at the same time of year.
Bellamy disagreed with Bennett about what makes football interesting, reminding his mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the league in 2010 by playing boring football.
"Wayne is talking about an interesting football.
He compared his team's game on Saturday to our game on Friday and thought their game was interesting", Bellamy said.
"In 2010, St George's was heavily criticised for its boring game, and Wayne said he was not at all moved by the criticism.
Now he has a team that can play so-called football, especially his young, fast-paced midfielders.
That's the kind of football you want to play when you have a player pool like this.
He stressed that in 2010, he wants everyone to play his style, because not every team has center forwards like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt.
It gives me confidence when the other coaches are so worried about my team going up against them that they resort to this.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think they'd be up against us in the big games.
Bellamy also mentioned that the Storm and Roosters scored more goals than the Broncos and Cowboys did.
The Broncos game was probably a good game, I haven't seen it, but what was the score?
Our game ended with a score of 20-18 and we had more situations in our game, but is that interesting football?
Or is it the absence and the lack of goals that make football interesting?
I think the goals make it interesting.
If they mention us, we'll probably come up against them".
The Storm have the weekend off because they're going to be able to play either the North Queensland Cowboys next Saturday or the Cronulla Sharks next Saturday at AAMI Park.
Serbian man released on $200,000 bail in a drug case.
A man facing a possible life sentence for the attempted possession of 40 kilos of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released on $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after police found a hundred kilograms of cocaine on board the Solay, a ship that had come through Vanuatu from South America and arrived in Coomera in August.
Police were monitoring Maximovic and his accomplice at the marina this morning, and later caught the two at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where a 40-kilogram batch of drugs was found in a Toyota Echo parked in the parking lot.
Although Maximovic faces the possibility of life in prison for possession of narcotics for commercial purposes, his lawyer says there is no evidence that his client tried to obtain the entire lot, and that he may have been in the cafe with no intent to harm.
According to Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan, there is a risk that Maksimovic will try to flee the country.
"Maksimovic clearly has connections to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often", the judge said in court on Wednesday.
"He lied to the police about where he lived".
Maximovic's mother and stepfather together posted bail of 200,000, against which he was released.
"After reading the affidavits of both individuals, it is clear that $200,000 is a real financial burden on them", said Judge Flanagan.
"However, that alone is not enough to stop the man from escaping", the judge warned.
Maksimovic was released on the condition that he surrender both his Australian and Serbian passports, report to the police daily and stay at home from 6pm to 6am.
Stevan Hogg used the girl 's phone to get pedophiles to send pictures .
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to obtain images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping and logged onto an online messaging service where he got another user to send him indecent pictures of children.
When she woke up later, she found the phone missing, and found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
While searching her phone, she found shocking messages and immediately told her mother.
After searching the computers found at the address, the police found a disturbing Internet search engine that used search terms to search for inappropriate child images.
Hogg claimed to the police that he had tried to mislead pedophiles on the Internet and had impersonated the police in order to scare pedophiles.
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told the local court at Dundee Sheriff Court: "He claimed to be addicted to people's fear.
He admitted to using a computer to search, but claimed that he did so to impersonate the police and thus intimidate pedophiles.
Hogg was asked about conversations with an unknown person who had sent the pictures to him and from whom Hogg had asked for more pictures.
Hogg claimed that his purpose was to mislead pedophiles.
He said that he had disturbing thoughts while drinking and wanted to look at pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added: "When the messages were found, the girl screamed at her mother, trembling and crying".
She saw some inappropriate pictures on her phone, and then Hogg was questioned.
The girl said the defendant used a computer and a Playstation to talk to girls who looked considerably younger than herself.
Hogg, 23, of Dundee Ward Road pleaded guilty to possession of indecent images of children on June 14 last year, violated his bail on January 25 of this year and failed to appear for his court hearing on March 24 of this year.
Defence counsel Gregor Sim has requested that Hogg be removed from the sex offender registry because it can be concluded that the crime did not involve any significant sexual features.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael has postponed sentencing until October due to a social worker background check.
Hogg was granted bail in this case but was held in custody on other grounds.
Hogg was added to the sex offender registry before the sentencing date.
Zimbabwe 's Robert Mugabe is giving a false speech in parliament
Africa's oldest head of state, Mugabe, fell down the steps leading to the speaker's chair earlier this year.
Mugabe was not injured, but a video of the incident quickly spread on social media.
The opening of Parliament was also overshadowed by claims by opposition lawmakers that they had received anonymous death threats warning them not to boo Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, MPs booed and interrupted the President's State of the Union address in Parliament with intermission shouts.
Innocent Gonese, a member of the MDC (Movement for Democratic Change) party, said seven opposition politicians had received text messages urging them not to disturb Mugabe's speeches.
"The message is from an unknown number, but the message is titled 'death,'" Gonese told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
The message warns the recipients that MEPs outside the European Parliament are no longer under immunity.
According to the party's spokesman, the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is concerned about the threats against politicians.
Hewlett-Packard is cutting up to 30,000 jobs .
Hewlett-Packard intends to cut 25 00030 000 jobs as part of restructuring and savings measures in its corporate services business.
HP will split into two publicly traded companies later this year, separating its computer and printer businesses from its faster-growing hardware and services businesses.
HP's press release states that the company will record a one-time charge of $2.7 billion for the arrangements beginning in the fourth quarter.
"The reorganization will provide a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise", said HP CEO Meg Whitman, who will lead the company after the split.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a smaller and more concentrated company than HP is today, and we have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that will help companies transition to a new business model", Whitman said.
"As a company, we are better placed than ever to respond to the changing needs of our customers around the world".
Hewlett Packard Enterprises has annual sales of over $50 billion and is focused on its mission of providing unique integrated technology solutions to businesses.
The company, founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, is now splitting into two, the two founding an electronics company in a Palo Alto garage that is now considered the birthplace of the Valley of Silence.
HP has been undergoing a massive restructuring as it moves from traditional desktop computers to mobile devices.
The changes at HP, the world's second-largest computer maker and one of the largest U.S. technology companies, are the latest move in a field where concentration is believed to bring success.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says the team must support injured Jack Wilshere before the match against Dinamo Zagreb .
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshere that it's only September, and if everything goes according to his rehabilitation plan, there's no reason why he can't be back on the field by December.
The best-case scenario means that Wilshere will definitely miss at least the next four England games, and knowing the man's history, his involvement in European Championships is clearly unclear.
The biggest downside to the latest problem is that Wilshere ended last season with a severe ankle injury and seemed to return to his former edge under the new season.
"An injury like this is not a career threat", Wenger said.
"The liver didn't heal properly.
It's not a serious injury.
This was just an accident.
It had nothing to do with his ankles or any previous injuries".
Medically, it could be, but as Wenger said, there could be additional injuries when a player tries to return to the field in the middle of the season.
There is also an unpleasant pattern.
Premier Injuries Ltd. lists 23 different injuries since Wilshere made his debut six years ago.
He also played for Arsenal in just 65 of 157 league games over the last five seasons.
The bigger picture for Arsenal is that from 2007-08 onwards, for six of the eight seasons, they have been the second most injured team in terms of money lost.
Wenger accepts a possible spell, but Arsenal believe the improvement in injury numbers over the last season will continue to improve.
"Sometimes a comeback from injury can be accompanied by a vulnerable period of strengthening the body and seeking competitive advantages", Wenger said.
"Jack's young, so he'll get through this.
I hope he gets his body back in balance, and I believe in that, and that will help him continue his career as he deserves".
Arsenal will begin their Champions League campaign on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, then face Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur the following Wednesday.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, so Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be the starters.
Wenger can also add Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud to the starting lineup to replace Nacho Montreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the team balanced and give rest to those who need it", Wenger said.
While Arsenal are the clear favourites to lift the F-Group, Maksimir Zagreb has some of the most fearsome stadiums in Europe.
Dinamo have also been unbeaten in 41 matches for the team.
The stadium was rocked Tuesday night when the earth shook to a magnitude of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the tenth earthquake in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes Arsenal have learned their lesson from last season's defeat to Monaco and is still motivated by the distant hope of guiding the team to the European Championship.
"We have a huge energy charge", Wenger said.
"This is the first time Arsenal have won the title.
We were very close in 2006, but I'm also a realist.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers".
FriendsFest: A comedy show that taught us the truth about male friendship.
A similar portrayal is notable for its absence from other series, which is noteworthy, especially when you consider that men's need to open up is greater than ever and the suicide rates among young men are at their highest in 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death for men aged 20-45 in the UK, with a three times higher rate among men than women.
The Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) is tackling the problem by declaring 2015 the Year of the Man, a campaign to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking the help they need.
Friendship is the ultimate idea of the challenge.
A recent study of 2,000 high school students found that people with depressive symptoms have a better chance of recovery when surrounded by healthy people.
The risk of developing the disease was also halved in asymptomatic individuals with close associates who did not have mental health problems.
But the foundation of all this is friendship.
Modern communication is dominated by social media, and communication style is often seen as more important than content.
With the digitization of life, the need to appear strong, fun and successful has doubled, even though isolation is a reality.
The external values that are associated with superficial success, money, image, social status, all of which distract from our inner values and our innate desire for personal growth and friendship, are more deeply rooted in our mental health.
A video game millionaire recently stated that money cannot really buy happiness.
The great thing about Friends was that it turned the focus of the show on its head.
None of the characters in the show were defined by their occupation, but by their personality, which was reflected in their friendships.
The show humorously featured Joey and Chandler hugging or watching football on their TV chairs, and we also saw Ross often missing Rachel, and it was clear that the men could relate to this, even though they didn't stop feeling full.
One volunteer explained to me: "Listening to people who are depressed and suicidal has made me realize how much even the smallest reactions of friends can mean.
The men who contact us often cannot speak to their friends.
The traditional idea that men should be successful is strong, and it is easy to view men as weak if they talk about their problems".
"Friends is one of those shows that showcases long-term survival mechanisms.
The show highlighted the little moments of friendship between men.
I can offer outside help by telephone in a moment of desperation, but long-term support comes from a close circle of friends and family".
In honor of Comedy Central's FriendsFest, the set of the show has been brought to life, so if you're attending the event this weekend, you might want to take your friends out for coffee at Central Perk.
Or do something even better, smile and say hello if you see someone sitting alone at Starbucks.
You never know how important a friendship can develop from that.
Comedy Central is airing the entire Frendit franchise  all 236 episodes  in honor of #FriendsFest
Di Maria's shot helped PSG to beat Malmö.
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavan after scoring against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria scored on his Champions League debut and helped PSG beat Swedish side Malmö on Tuesday.
Read the game report and the score.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were in the limelight as Paris Saint-Germain kicked off their Champions League campaign with a win at Malmö's Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored with less than four minutes to play in the first leg, and he immediately cemented his position as French champions in a handshake.
The A-League also includes Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, so PSG needed a strong start against the Swedish champions.
Despite the SPG scoring, the match was not a perfect performance for the team led by Laurent Blanc, who lost the goalkeeping spot to Zlatan Ibrahimovic and was replaced by his former club, where he started his brilliant career in 1999.
"It is not easy to win the Champions League at home or away, so a 2-0 win and good handshakes are a good basis, even if we still have a disappointing season to go", Blanc said.
"This is good.
We were hungry to win and we were able to do it, but it's a shame we couldn't score one or two more goals".
Ibrahimovic returned to the team after an injury, and the team had to settle for a 2-2 draw against Bordeaux in Ligue 1 at the weekend, but Di Maria overshadowed Ibrahimovic by four minutes.
The Argentine defender, who joined PSG from Manchester United last month, was named PSG's man of the match to take the team to a new level in Europe, proving worthy of the honour by rushing the ball from Marco Verratt's pass to Malmö's defence and then firing a precise shot into the back corner past Johan Wiland.
However, those who expected a landslide victory for PSG were disappointed.
Malmö defeated Celtic in the playoffs, marched nine international players onto the field from the start, and a team with a five-man defense and two-man attack tactics was hard to beat.
Nikola Djurdjic's shot narrowly missed Kevin Trapp's goal from the back of the net in the 34th minute of the game.
PSG, on the other hand, fell to a lack of pitching and poor finishing, not least Ibrahimovic, who lost five points in the first half alone.
However, Ibrahimovic showed his hands in the passing game, and after Ibrahimovic's pass, Di Maria kicked a curve ball past Wiland in the 52nd minute.
The second goal came in the countdown, thanks to Cavan, who, playing through the sixth, hit a full-sided shot when Ibrahimovic gave him a pass from left-footer Maxwell.
Malmö's run ended with the second goal, and only Wilandi's top-flight close-range shot by David Luiz kept the numbers in check, and Ezequiel Lavezz's goal from the bench was abandoned on the final yard.
Malmö's goalkeeper Åge Hareide later admitted that PSG was in a class of its own. "We played our last Champions League game last December.
Since then, we've only played in the Swedish league, where the level is not the same.
I'm not gonna let you get away with it.
A hat to the Parisians.
This was the best fight they ever had".
Glencore is raising $ 2.5 billion in a stock auction.
Swiss mining giant Glencore, tempted by falling commodity prices, raised $2.5 billion in a stock offering on Wednesday as part of its debt-reduction strategy.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, said in a statement that it had sold some £1.6 billion worth of new shares to reduce its debt.
The company's market value fell by 57% this year, and it is struggling with the collapse in raw material prices as the Chinese economic downturn hampers demand and strains the market.
With the stock market boom, Glencore's stock price shot to the top of the London Stock Exchange by the early hours of Wednesday morning.
The share rose by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 pence in the FTSE 100 index, which opened up by 0.69 per cent.
Glencore announced last week that it plans to raise $2.5 billion in a stock offering as part of a strategy to reduce its $30 billion debt by a third.
The company sold new shareholders for 125 pence, a 2.4 percent drop from Tuesday's closing price.
The company issued 1.3 billion shares, representing a total value of up to 9,99% of the total group.
The Commission established the profitability of the sampled Union producers by expressing the pre-tax net profit of the sales of the like product to unrelated customers in the Union as a percentage of the turnover of those sales.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping 's visit to Washington
A statement released by the White House on Tuesday confirms that Chinese President Xi Jinping will travel to the United States for a state visit later this month.
Xi Jinping will arrive in Washington on September 25 for his first official visit, following President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing last November.
Following bilateral talks between the heads of state, the President and First Lady of the United States, Michelle Obama, will host a state visit dinner for Xi Jinping and his wife, Peng Liyuan.
"President Xi Jinping's visit provides an opportunity to expand U.S.-China cooperation on a wide range of global, regional and bilateral issues of mutual interest, while President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping have the opportunity to engage in constructive discussions on issues of mutual disagreement", the White House statement said.
Xi Jinping's visit was first announced in February and he is expected to stop in Seattle to meet with several US technology leaders, before continuing to Washington and New York for the UN General Assembly on September 28.
Obama and Xi are expected to raise a number of contentious issues, including Washington's concerns about alleged Chinese cyber espionage and the country's increased activities in disputed waters in the South China Sea.
Matt Damon underestimates the diversity of the film industry .
Matt Damon had a heated conversation with African-American Effie Brown and said that diversity is not necessary behind the camera.
On Sunday night's episode of HBO's Project Greenlight, the veteran actor interrupted Brown as he explained the importance of considering differences in opinion regarding the dark-skinned lead in the script.
"Monogamy is about the movie, not the show", Damon said.
Brown was shocked and hurt by the statement. "Wow, that's it", she said after the comment from Damon, who starred in the movie Alone on Mars.
Damon and Brown had met with fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the finalists for the competition.
"Whoever is directing, I would encourage them to think about how Harmony's character is being portrayed", Brown said at the beginning.
"The only black character is a prostitute having sex with a white pimp".
The producer of Dear White People, who had recommended Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio to direct the film, Damon responded rudely that choosing the two could lead to an unintended outcome.
When the debate was televised, social media exploded with damon's obnoxious comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the scene in direct words: "The fact that Matt Damon is talking to the only black person to explain what diversity is is so white-ish it hurts".
The tweet was shared over 5,000 times, and it was liked 4,000 times.
Damon's comments come at a time when the fair representation of human races in the media is a hot topic.
After the death of teen Michael Brown, shot by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained national support, seeking to end the discriminatory treatment of black people by lawmakers and government officials.
In February, Prince made a reference to the movement when he announced the nominees for Album of the Year at the Grammy Awards.
"The albums still matter", he said.
"Just like books and black life, albums still matter".
Recently, the Black Lives Matter movement issued a statement in response to a question from Elisabeth Hasselbeck of Fow News about whether the group should be classified as a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a group based on love", the movement's leadership said.
Damon is one of a handful of entertainers, producers and media moguls who have been invited to the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It's not clear if Damon has answered the invitation.
The first winner of the American Ninja Warrior series.
Professional mirror and dish collector Isaac Caldiero claimed his first American Ninja Warrior title on Monday and claimed a million-dollar prize.
The seventh season of the TV show, which just ended, was the first to explore all the tasks assigned.
In the season finale, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten made it to the final round.
The final task required the men to pull a 75-foot-long [23 m] rope upward in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first competitor to complete the fourth stage of the American Ninja Warrior competition with a clear time of 1:00.
Caldiero told E!News that after a tough fight, he's still in shock after winning the million-dollar jackpot.
"The amount of money I win is amazing, because I've never made more than $10,000 a year", he said in an E! interview about his jackpot.
"Suddenly, I can't even imagine what's next, the future is wide open".
Executive producer Kent Weed spoke to The Hollywood Reporter about the final and why Brittany is not being rewarded, even though she was the first contestant to complete all the tasks.
"The rules say the fastest wins the prize money.
If more competitors complete all the tasks, the fastest one wins", Weed explained.
"The prize money is great and life-changing, but Britten also gets satisfaction from his performance.
I don't think he's gonna be here to dig it any more than that.
He's just happy with his performance.
He's been getting a lot of praise from his fans.
Britten is a great guy, and family is important to him.
His wife and children think he's a hero.
Geoff told me that since he didn't win himself, he preferred to play the victory to Isaac.
She also believes that Isaac would have felt the same way about her if the situation had been different".
America Ninja Warrior was renewed for an eighth season, which will begin filming in spring 2016.
The Detroit Tigers have just squeezed a win over the Minnesota Twins .
The Detroit Tigers aren't having a particularly pleasant experience in the second half of the season.
The Tigers, once one of baseball's greatest teams, are now in last place in the American League Central.
However, the team managed to beat the Minnesota Twins on Tuesday at Target Field.
The Twins lost their chance to rise to the Houston Astros to fight for the second wild card spot in the playoffs.
Detroit returned, if only for one night, to a taste of victory that has been a rock in the second half of the season.
"Every win is nice, no matter how it's won", said Tigers quarterback Brad Ausmus.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon held up as Detroit had three hits in the first two innings, one in the sixth and one in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 1/3 innings, good game, and gave up three runs.
He's only got three good starts in nine outings.
"I just want to finish the season strong this year", Simon said.
"It's hard to throw a substitute every game, so I want to pitch until the sixth inning".
Tigers' starting pitcher Victor Martinez had three hits and two runs, his first runs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit night since he had four against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He hit well", Ausmus remarked.
"He looks good in practice and kept his strength in the game".
In the second inning of the seventh inning, the Twins had the best chance of getting back in the game.
Center Byron Buxton opened the inning with a two-run home run in the bottom of the left sideline.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks hit the sacrifice ball, and Simon took over for second baseman Brian Dozier, who had three straight shots before being replaced by left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Herdy got a free throw to Mauer, and the incoming second baseman Miguel Sano hit a two-run homer, followed by right-hander Drew VerHagen.
With two running backs on the field, VerHagen got third baseman Trevor Plouffen to burn two players.
Major League Baseball's 27th lead this season, with Plouffe burning two players.
After Detroit had scored a run in the bottom of the ninth inning, Tigers tight end Bruce Rondon hit a two-run home run to tie the game at 5-4.
However, the right-handed pitcher threw three straight shots and was able to hold his team's position.
Detroit took advantage of Phil Hughes's rusty little frame.
The Tigers had three runs in the first two innings against a right-handed pitcher who had just been released from the injured list and was sidelined for a month with a spinal cord injury.
"Obviously, the start was not what I had hoped for, but as the game progressed, I started to feel more comfortable and I was able to perform well and make a good pass in the third inning", Hughes said.
Coming into the lead, Hughes gave up a one-run home run to second baseman Ian Kinsler in the first inning.
A free throw by right fielder J.D. Martinez gave Victor Martinez the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez's 0/21 pipe broke when the team had players on the bench.
Next up, third baseman Nick Castellanos had one base hit, one run, but Victor Martinez was burned trying to advance to third.
The Tigers extended their lead in the second quarter, with catcher James McCann surviving a hit to second and Anthony Gose to first, making it 3-0 at the plate.
"That was a pretty good shot", Twins coach Paul Molitor said.
"He didn't hit particularly well, but the punch hit the right spot".
In the passing game, Hughes pitched a scoreless third, then was traded to right-handed relief pitcher A.J. Achter.
Hughes had three runs, six hits, a walk-off home run and four RBIs.
Note: Tigers right-handed hitter Anibal Sanchez was not on the roster due to a torn ACL.
The shoulder is being examined by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on injured reserve with a torn shoulder since mid-August and was scheduled to make his debut on Wednesday.
When Sanchez is out of the game, left-handed batter Daniel Norris will be out of the injured list and in the starting lineup for the Twins.
Norris has hit .110 in four games since being traded to left-handed batter David Price on July 30.
He's been out of the lineup since August 20th with a ruptured hamstring.
The Tigers and Twins are tied at Target Field on Wednesday for their final three games.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) is facing right-handed pitcher Ervin Santana of Minnesota (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi urges opening up the economy to the rest of the world
"The economic system must be open to the rest of the world to promote growth", President Xi Jinping said at a meeting of the Economic Reform Steering Group on Tuesday.
"China should commit to attracting foreign investment and expertise and develop a policy of economic opening", the president said at the 16th meeting of the Central Steering Group for deepening comprehensive reform.
"By extending the policy of opening-up and deepening reforms, we will unleash a new impetus and vitality for economic growth", Xi said.
The Management Board adopted guidelines which included a negative list regulating market access, relaxing border control policies, promoting the inclusion of private capital in state-owned enterprises and revising the citizens' registration system.
The Commission's communication sets out the objective of establishing a negative list of sectors and undertakings in which investment is prohibited.
The system will be tested gradually and developed by means of test programmes.
The Communication states that this is a significant change, as it gives the market a greater role in allocating resources, creating a legal business environment and opening up the market.
The government is also relaxing controls on companies, and so we want to make sure that companies have the power to decide what they do.
The Communication states that China will allow the development of new cross-border cooperation models in border areas and the search for new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
The opening of state-controlled sectors will open up many sectors to private investment.
"The government will not change its foreign investment policy, but will support the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better services", the statement said.
The Commission will also be able to provide information on the application process for the permanent residence permit by optimising the requirements and streamlining the application process.
The meeting also discussed the right of lawyers to practise and the support of judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang, Party leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli.
