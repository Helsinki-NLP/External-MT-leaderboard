Fire in French chemical plant extinguished
The fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen, which is considered to be particularly dangerous, has been extinguished, the Normandy prefecture announced on Friday. Fire broke out during the night on Thursday. Nobody was injured in the incident.
The fire could be stopped
Buildings within a radius of 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday. Additives for lubricants are produced in the chemical plant on the banks of the Seine. The factory belongs to the Lubrizol company of US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso "directive of the EU, which imposes particularly strict safety requirements.
Approximately 400 people work at the plant. The chemical factory has already made headlines in the past – for example, when the gas methane-thiol escaped through a leak in 2013 and the surrounding area smelled of rotten eggs. In 2015, around 2,000 litres of mineral oil were poured into the city ’ s sewage system following an industrial accident.
Woman cancels her job to look for 57 days after her missing bitch
For two months, a woman from Washington searched for her missing dog - and specifically quit her job. The seven-year-old Border Collie had left the hotel room during a short vacation in Montana. 57 days lacked every trace of the dog - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I felt nauseous," Carole King told Daily Inter Lake. She and her husband had left Katie in the hotel room while they went out for dinner. Katie had disappeared when they returned to the hotel, looking for the animal, but to no avail.
Donner had put dog in panic
In the hope that Katie could still be in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says:" She left about four, four and a half hours ago, "recalls Carole King opposite" Daily Inter Lake. "When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie ran out immediately. Presumably, a loud thunder had panicked the dog.
With flyers and Facebook calls, the Kings searched for their beloved dog. However, days turned into weeks. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," Carole King told Daily Inter Lake, who quit her job as a postal worker to continue her search for Katie.
"The tears flowed"
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King received a phone call from a man saying that Katie was in his yard. However, by the time King arrived, Katie had already gone. She searched the neighborhood and suddenly her dog was standing under a tree. "I just hugged her. I didn't want to let her go," King remembered loudly, "Daily Inter Lake." The tears flowed, people stopped in their vehicles, got out and hugged us. I think the whole neighborhood knew we had found them. "
Losses at the Bundeswehr: Machine guns disappear without a trace
Friday, 27. September 2019
Six MG3 machine guns have still disappeared.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition, including three machine guns. In most cases, the whereabouts are unclear; the opposition speaks of a "frightening" extent.
With the Bundeswehr, weapons and ammunition disappear again and again – many of them without a trace. Since the beginning of 2014, the troops have recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 weapon parts and almost 20,000 rounds of ammunition, according to a list classified as classified by the Federal Ministry of Defence, on which the German editorial network reports.
According to the paper from the office of State Secretary for Defence Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one part of them and 3,474 rounds of ammunition have reappeared to date. In addition, six machine guns of the type MG3, eleven rifles of the type G3, four rifles of the type G36, six signal pistols and two pistols of the type P8 are still missing. Furthermore, 30 weapon barrels for machine guns of the type MG3 are missing.
The extent of the loss of weapons and ammunition in the Bundeswehr is "frightening", said the left-wing Martina Renner, member of the Bundestag. This is all the more true because hardly anything has been found in the course of investigations, and the left-wing politician Renner spoke of a "poor record." Renner criticised the fact that the list does not indicate whether the missing ammunition is the one found in connection with the investigations against the suspected terrorist Bundeswehr officer Franco A. "And this even though a supporter of Franco A. was recently convicted of possessing these ammunition," said Renner.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after its fixing by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of the city of Bandar Abbas today Friday. According to ship observation data from Refinitive, the tanker started to move and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid in the United Arab Emirates was named as the destination port.
The tanker had actually already been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but initially it remained in Iranian waters. From the shipping company it was said that they wanted to wait for an official notification from Tehran.
The "Stena Impero" was set up on 19 July by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the Strait of Hormuz on charges of violating security regulations. However, it was suspected that Iran was reacting to the controversial temporary detention of an Iranian oil tanker off Gibraltar, which belongs to Great Britain.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the global oil export is shipped through the Strait. Tensions in the region had intensified immensely in recent months. Merchant shipping was dragged into the conflict between the U.S. and Iran. There were several incidents involving tankers and drones.
Merkel pays tribute to the courage of the people in the Peaceful Revolution
Chancellor Angela Merkel has paid tribute to the commitment of the people in the GDR who took to the streets 30 years ago during the Peaceful Revolution. In the autumn of 1989, courageous citizens would have shaken the then GDR regime, Merkel said at a ceremony of the Thuringian CDU parliamentary group on the upcoming Day of German Unity in Erfurt. Chancellor Merkel recalled, among other things, the occupation of the Stasi headquarters.
Musk seeks delivery record
Teslas quarter holds possibly record ready. Despite delivery boom there were recently losses with the electric car company.
New York.Tesla ’ s CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car group a big boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record figures. “We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries, ” Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog“ Electrek ”.
The demand is strong, so that Tesla could register 110000 orders, it continued in Musks circular. The challenge is to bring the cars swiftly to the customers. Tesla must provide for it at the end of the quarter as much resources as possible.
Investors liked it: Tesla ’ s shares went out of the market with a plus of over six percent. The price has not increased as strongly for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla delivered a good 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his ambitious goals. In 2019, he plans to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. To achieve this, six-figure figures must be produced in the current and coming quarters. Above all, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there have been recent losses.
Puzzle solved: That's why we can't tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the cerebrum prevents people from tickling themselves. Scientists at Humboldt University in Berlin found out this with the help of experiments on rats, as they reported on Thursday night. Progress had also been made on the question of why children defend themselves so vigorously against tickling, only to then demand more.
After all, it has also been shown why the mere approach of a tickling hand triggers laughter even before the touch, which is due to a deep-seated layer in the cerebrum, which already triggers laughter during the expectation of tickling.
According to the data, earlier research showed that rats react with "laughter" in the ultrasound range when tickled by humans. "Laughter" is mediated by the part of the cerebral cortex, which serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughter is suppressed during self-touch
Until now, it had been assumed that the brain could distinguish between self-contact and contact by others – which is why people cannot tickle themselves. However, in the experiments on rats, the Berlin-based researchers found that the laughter and the activity of the relevant area of the cerebral cortex were suppressed during self-contact, which is also the case when living beings clean themselves. However, the activity in the brain and the impulse to laugh were amplified during external contact and tickling by the scientists.
However, if the self-contact and the touch by others happen at the same time, the laughter is also suppressed, indicating that the brain of the rat cannot distinguish between the self-contact and the touch by others. However, the new findings suggested that people cannot tickle themselves because the self-contact activates a brake in the cerebrum.
In addition, the rats had been trained to tickle themselves. Therefore, they sometimes interrupted this initiation prematurely in the experiment, showing flight behaviour or fright. This ambivalence is similar to the behaviour of the children. The ambivalence of tickling is a behavioural reaction, which is the same in rats and humans.
Disaster averted: Major fire in French chemical plant extinguished
The prefecture of Normandy announced to the AFP news agency on Friday that a major fire had been extinguished in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen that was considered to be particularly dangerous.
According to the authorities, no hazardous substances have been spilled, and the samples taken do not give cause for concern, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. No one was injured in the incident.
Schools and kindergartens have been closed
Residents were called upon not to leave their homes. Buildings within a radius of 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday.
Factory belongs to the company Lubrizol by U.S. Founder-billionaire Warren Buffett
The chemical plant on the banks of the Seine River produces additives for lubricants. Lubrizol is owned by US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called EU Seveso Directive, which imposes particularly strict safety requirements. Approximately 400 people work at the plant.
The chemical factory has already made headlines in the past – for example, when the gas methanthiol escaped through a leak in 2013 and the surrounding area smelled of rotten eggs. In 2015, around 2,000 litres of mineral oil were poured into the city ’ s sewage system following an accident.
Brexit: Johnson criticized by his own sister
The Prime Minister ’ s sister commented on Boris Johnson ’ s speech at the Parliament ’ s first session after the suspension of the compulsory break on Wednesday evening, threatening to lead the country out of the EU on 31 October if Brussels does not agree to his demands for changes to the Brexit agreement.
Speaking about Cox, who had campaigned for Britain to remain in the European Union, the Prime Minister said: "The best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox and reunite this country would be to withdraw from the EU." Cox was murdered by a right-wing extremist during the 2016 referendum.
Monument to attacks of Oslo and Utöya to be unveiled
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 dead, a memorial in honor of the victims will be unveiled in Norway on Saturday. The monument "Jernrosene" (German: the iron roses) consists of about 1,000 iron rose replicas. They commemorate the roses laid by thousands of people in the days and weeks after the attacks in front of the cathedral in Oslo.
The project by the artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is now to be unveiled at the same location – the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and relatives of the victims. Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette Marit are expected to attend the opening.
On 22 July 2011, the right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik set off a car bomb in the government district of Oslo and subsequently shot dozens of participants in a holiday camp run by the youth organisation of the Social Democratic Workers ’ Party on the island of Utöya. 77 people were killed in the attacks.
Iran releases British tankers
The UN General Debate did not bring a solution to Iran ’ s conflict, but now there is one problem less. Stena Impero, a British oil tanker detained in Iran, was able to set sail again. It could be a piece of the jigsaw in Iranian President Rouhani ’ s peace plan.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero", which has been detained in the Strait of Hormuz in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters. After being approved by the Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as the shipping company Stena Bulk announced.
The "Stena Impero" has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now, among other things, going to Dubai for medical examinations, said shipping company director Erik Hånell. Around noon the ship has left the Iranian waters. "Nice that it is over," he said to the Swedish television station SVT.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in London called the fixing of the ship illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to undermine the freedom of the seas. We are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," it said in a statement on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had fixed the tanker on 19 July on the charge of having violated the provisions of the Law of the Sea in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. According to Hånell, the remaining 16 crew members were doing well. In view of the difficult and stressful situation in the past ten weeks they had behaved professionally and the company is now working on reuniting them with their families as quickly as possible.
The British government suspected that behind the fixing of the "Stena Impero" a reaction to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar: At the beginning of July a supertanker with oil from Iran, which was supposed to have been destined for Syria, was chained there. According to the authorities, the delivery violated sanctions against the war-country Syria against the EU. The British had received the reference to the ship from the USA.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. London vehemently rejected assumptions that it was a matter of a barter transaction to get the "Stena Impero" free.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world ’ s oil exports are shipped through the Strait. Tensions in the region have intensified immensely in recent months. Merchant shipping has been dragged into the conflict between the U.S. and Iran. There have been several incidents involving tankers and drones.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute between the two countries. The Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. In 2018, the U.S. had single-handedly withdrawn from the international nuclear agreement, which should prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb and at the same time end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the U.S. government has been putting the leadership in Tehran under pressure with massive economic sanctions against the country to enforce a stricter agreement that is extended to other areas. Iran resists the pressure so far.
Due to the dispute over the "Stena Impero" and further incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil installations in Saudi Arabia, the USA is working on a coalition for the military protection of merchant ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani presented a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormuz at the UN General Assembly in New York. With the initiative "Coalition of Hope" for the Persian Gulf, Iran, together with the Arab Gulf states and without foreign protection powers, wanted to ensure the safety of navigation in the Persian Gulf.
India ’ s protectionist economic policies are building a better future for itself.
India would actually be predestined to become a "war profiteer." Given the punitive tariffs that American President Donald Trump imposes on Chinese producers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to reschedule. Asian finance executives who are considering moving their production from China to another country cite India as one of the preferred alternatives in a UBS poll. Of course, this has to do not only with the imponderables of the Chinese American trade war. India, with a huge pool of young workers and a domestic market of 1.3 billion consumers, seems to have been created to play a more significant role in the globally widespread production chain.
But now India itself has come into Trump ’ s focus. Discredited by the White House as the “kingdom of tariffs, ” America withdrew trade benefits for 2000 products from the emerging market at the beginning of June. America accuses India of prohibitively high tariffs and calls for better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles, and more.
On the world map of trade wars, the frictions with India are of course only a side show. Moreover, America also views the world ’ s largest democracy through the lens of security policy. Delhi and Washington share concerns about China ’ s claims to power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a volley of US punitive tariffs against India seems unlikely. India ’ s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just taken up a second five-year term, should therefore lull himself to safety.
The problem, however, lies elsewhere: the empirically substantiated thesis that open markets accelerate economic development has a hard time in the socialist republic of India. Even among Modi. His eagerness to reform is mainly aimed at bureaucratic madness, which has suffocated any entrepreneurial spirit in the multi-ethnic state for too long. Companies now receive building permits more quickly. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more accessible insolvency and bankruptcy law creates the conditions for liquidating seemingly dead companies with high debts more quickly.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic point of view, much has changed for the better in India in the first five modes. However, this does not apply to trade policy. Inspired by the idea of protecting internationally uncompetitive companies from foreign suppliers, the national conservative government even erected new barriers.
In the West, Modi clings to the aura of the energetic reformer who radically renews his country ’ s economy, owing not least to the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows all too well what vocabulary Western managers like. At its core, however, the “India First ” advocate has never moved away from protectionist economic policies, which prevent Indian firms from being forced to dispose of anachronistic practices and thus become fit for global competition. Businessmen who survive thanks to the isolation of their industries are among the core voters of Modi ’ s nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and applaud this short-sighted policy.
Burial of Jacques Chirac in Paris on Monday
According to a report, former French President Jacques Chirac is to be buried next week in Paris. According to the AFP news agency, the former head of state will be buried on Monday in the Montparnasse cemetery in the south of the French capital, citing the Chiracs family. Funeral services will be held in the close family circle. A public funeral in the Invalides Cathedral in Paris was scheduled for Sunday, the media reported.
Brought the competitors to the finish: Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Championships in Athletics
The world was already at the finish line, when heartwarming scenes took place in the cooled down Khalifa International Stadium. Jonathan Busby from Aruba started to shake dangerously in the first run of the men over 5000 meters. He could hardly keep his feet on the ground 300 meters before the finish, ran in an unhealthy bent posture, when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country Guinea in Bissau suddenly hooked up to him and dragged the last half round of the stadium to the finish. However, the forces were still sufficient for both to stop the running wristwatch after the goal run. As if the scene had not been curious enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Everybody in this situation would have done the same," said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he unexpectedly caught the attention of the assembled journalists. Shyly, he avoided first, did not want to talk about his heroic deed at all. Finally, he wanted to set his personal best time and when he realized that this would be difficult, he just wanted to help a fellow sufferer, and anyway, he would only be proud to represent his country, which was invited to the World Championships by the World Federation. Under normal circumstances, he should not even have started. "That's why I'm proud to run here for my country," he said.
That night he did that emphatically - and much more intensively than he would have thought, because this heroic deed will be remembered, especially since Dabo even let his rival Busby take the lead at the finish and voluntarily took the last place - by the way, a good five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this preliminary.In the end, it did not use anything, because Busby, who had only reached the finish with a lot of help, was disqualified by the World Athletics Association at the end.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies in Lisbon, competed to set a personal best at the World Championships in Doha. According to the official data, this was achieved with 18: 10.87 minutes, but he himself was disappointed: "I wanted to run 17: 55 minutes. I was already under 18 minutes." However, only in practice, personal bests do not count.
Mash of millions: Egyptians prepare for wild protest day
In Egypt, security measures have been stepped up in the run-up to possible anti-government protests. An increased police presence was observed in the center of Cairo on Friday. Several underground stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir square were closed.
In the past few days, the police had strengthened their roadside checks and searched the mobile phones of pedestrians partly for news and photos in connection with the protests. Hundreds had been arrested, according to two non-governmental organizations.
Opponent of Al-Sisi
Last weekend hundreds of people gathered in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura to protest against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi ’ s government, which has been accused of corruption and mismanagement for years. Mohammed Ali, an Egyptian construction contractor and actor living in exile in Spain, has called for a “march of millions ” in the country ’ s central squares this Friday. Ali is calling for a“ people ’ s revolution ”. Although the man is not a “good guy ” for most young Egyptians, because he has racketed millions as a subcontractor for the army, his messages are coming in. Ali is not the only one who has been accused of corruption and mismanagement.
According to two groups of observers, the number of arrests in connection with the protests continued to rise. By Friday, the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) had more than 1,570 arrests, while the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. These figures could not be confirmed independently at first.
Arbitrary arrests
According to HRW, many people have been "arbitrarily arrested" simply because they were "in the wrong place at the wrong time", according to lawyers, and the charges against those arrested range from "spreading false information" to being a member of a "terrorist organisation", according to their lawyers. In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, security forces in uniform, but also in civilian clothing, also arbitrarily interrogated and searched passers-by, according to HRW.
HRW also criticized the censorship in the North African country. According to this, the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services in order to prevent further protests against Sisi.
Online Retailers: Returns should be easier to donate
For online retailers, many returned parcels are lost goods. Around 20 million returns end up in the garbage. But there is an alternative.
The Treasury Department has shown online retailers like Amazon and Zalando a way to donate rather than destroy returned products.
Although the companies cannot be exempt from VAT on donations in kind, explained the ministry to a question by the Green Party, about which the newspapers of the Sparke Mediengruppe reported on Friday. However, the retailers could set the market value of the unsaleable returns so low that they had to pay no or only little VAT.
Scientists of the University of Bamberg had determined that the Federal citizens send back with orders in the Internet every sixth parcel again. Approximately four per cent of the goods - approximately 20 million products - landed afterwards in the garbage. To donate it would cost the enterprises according to current legal situation additionally money, because the tax authorities evaluate donations in kind like a conversion, on which then value added tax results.
Greens / EFA Katrin Göring, leader of the parliamentary group, called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to make it clear with a decree that companies can evaluate non-saleable products accordingly and donate free of charge to non-profit organisations. Companies must be able to rely on not being punished for donating, not only for online retail, but also for other businesses from fashion stores to DIY stores.
Banksy ’ s art for auction: There has never been a better time to sell this painting
"Devolved Parliament", a well-known work by Streetart, will soon be auctioned off.
For Branczik, Banksy ’ s work underscores “the regression of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the world to the basic attitude of animals and tribes. ” Starting on Saturday, the painting will be exhibited at Sotheby ’ s in the British capital until it is to be auctioned off on October 3. It is estimated at 1.5 to 2 million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Bristol Museum in the south-west of the UK, where Banksy lives. This year, the artist exhibited the painting again, coinciding with the original Brexit date of 29 March. On this occasion, the work, formerly known as Question Time, was renamed Devolved Parliament.
The picture could change hands for millions.
Most recently, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had engaged in a tough battle with the opposition at Wednesday ’ s first session of the House of Commons after Johnson ’ s forced break was lifted by the Supreme Court. Johnson wants to implement Brexit, which has already been postponed twice, on October 31, if necessary even without an agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, has interfered in the Brexit debate. In Dover, in the south-east of England, he painted a picture depicting a man shattering a star of the European flag with a chisel, which thousands of trucks and other visitors see every day as they enter the United Kingdom.
The Brexit debate is like a "walk in the park"
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson ’ s violent verbal attacks on Brexit ’ s opponents in parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred, according to his senior advisor. Compared to the campaign before the Brexit referendum in 2016, the current controversy is a “walk in the park, ” said Dominic Cummings at a book launch on Friday.“ We enjoy it. We will leave (the EU) and we will win. ”
Johnson had harshly attacked Brexit opponents in parliament in recent days and accused them, among other things, of "betraying" the people. Accusations that he could endanger the MPs because they could be the target of death threats, he dismissed as "humbug".
Cummings said that the only way to restore calm is for MPs to finally respect Britain ’ s decision to leave the EU. Unsurprisingly, people are upset that Britain has not yet left the EU, three years after the referendum.
In view of the charged atmosphere even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint on Friday. "We should speak with respect", it said in a statement. "And we should also listen".
Pakistan ’ s Prime Minister Khan Calls for UN Intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan ’ s Prime Minister Imran Khan once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict in his first appearance before the UN General Assembly.
Otherwise, a renewed war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said on Friday at the UN General Debate in New York. "If things go badly, hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst." The United Nations had a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented it."
Since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, India and Pakistan have fought three wars, two of them over the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers each control a part of Kashmir, another part belongs to China. At the beginning of August, India had removed the status of autonomy from the Indian Kashmir region, thereby increasing tensions in its relations with Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
Demonstrators in Cairo demand the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
The government is reacting harshly to the current protests in Egypt. It is firing live ammunition at the population, with more than 2,000 detainees joining the 60,000 political prisoners already in prison. Protesting has never been without danger in Egypt. However, since General Abdel Fattah el Sisi came to power in 2013, the state apparatus has been doing everything it can to avoid a scenario similar to that of the Arab Spring.
But one of the causes of the protests in 2011 was the poor economic situation. Poverty, lack of prospects and the feeling of being suffocated by one ’ s own government drove millions onto the streets. And this is a problem that the regime of El ’ sisi cannot get a grip on, no matter how hard it deals with adversaries.
Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the rate of inflation is at ten percent. Whoever wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket has to decide who he finances: Nestlé, Coca Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for the oppression but also the largest economic actor. The military builds roads, houses, football stadiums, produces food and much more. That was already the case before El ’ Sisi. The Egyptian people have a lot of experience with authoritarian regimes, and the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one. It is always critical when large parts of the population have difficulties to afford a bottle of water at all.
TÜV examinations in the terminal: BER: Chief: No more "show stoppers" for capital airport
Two months were checked to see whether the complex system mesh at the BER ’ fire protection works together, and the operators are satisfied with the course of events. However, the TÜV is not yet finished at the BER.
Following large-scale Tüv tests in the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators have confirmed the planned opening in October next year. Rainer Bretschneider, chairman of the supervisory board, said this for sure after a meeting of the supervisory board.
Airport chief Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successful audit, but also said that there were still deficiencies to be worked through in the terminal. "We have many detailed topics, but we don't have a real show stopper." He assured that the schedule for commissioning still contains buffers.
However, there are indications that the time reserve should no longer be too large. Now, the construction completion notice is to be submitted to the building authorities in the course of the first quarter of 2020, which was planned for this autumn at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of deficiencies in power cables have yet to be remedied; the Tüv wants to examine them by February. "In order to create the prerequisites for the commencement of flight operations, intensive work must continue on the processing of the deficiencies," it stated in a written communication.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases there is a lack of evidence, rather than new cables, and that there is still no clearance for all the dowels on which the cable runs hang, which he expects to be available by the end of the year.
Furthermore, fire protection at the crossing to the station below the terminal is not yet functioning satisfactorily and the problems had already led the project into another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoke aprons that go down like a screen in a fire so that the smoke does not spread. They drive down too far. 36 engines therefore have to be replaced and there will be new trials with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other structural defects as well as planning errors have delayed the opening of the airport for years. Originally, it was scheduled to go into operation in 2011. Costs have risen since the start of construction in 2006 from two billion to approximately 6.5 billion euros for the opening next year.
Because passenger numbers in Berlin have risen significantly since then, those responsible are planning to expand the airport. This is the subject of a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October, as Chairman Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Chief Financial Officer Heike Fölster will move to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, personnel manager Manfred Bobke von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She had put the airport finances on firm feet.
Chemnitz: Vending machines for drugs blown up - police arrest man
He needed money for drugs - and blew up several vending machines in the Chemnitz city area! Now the perpetrator is finally in custody!
Over the past two years, the number of cigarette and parking ticket machines in Chemnitz and the region has risen sharply, causing millions of dollars worth of damage!
At the end of May, after two detonations, the police apprehended a 33-year-old German on Bu ̈ rgerstrasse and Further Strasse in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigations into the creation of explosives in conjunction with a particularly serious case of theft, which were carried out by the criminal investigation department in Chemnitz, not only this suspicion was confirmed against the 33 year-old".
Faced with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now admitted a total of eight acts.
The police spokesman said: "He apparently used the loot to finance his drug addiction." Between August 20, 2018 and May 31, 2019, the bomber blew up four parking ticket machines on Bu ̈ rgerstrasse.
The total damage incurred amounts to at least 60 000 Euros!
The vending machine, Bomber is now in custody. The police investigation against him continue.
It is conceivable that he was also responsible for more vending machines, namely blasting in Chemnitz and adjacent districts.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
In the midst of a price war with low-cost airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa subsidiary AUA is taking over "the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna", confirmed a press spokesman of Austrian Airlines to APA on Friday. "AviationNetOnline" had previously reported on this.
The Vienna base of Lufthansa ’ s low-cost airline Eurowings will thus de facto be dissolved. Of the seven Eurowings currently in operation, four remain in Vienna. From January 2020, the latter will be taken over by the AUA in a wet-lease, i.e. including Eurowings personnel. In future, three Eurowings aircraft will be stationed in Salzburg, which will fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck to holiday destinations as charter planes. Eurowings Germany will take over routes from Vienna to Germany.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA ’ s hub and network planning, explained the spokesman. Flight times will be coordinated with connecting flights. The aim is to strengthen the Vienna hub on the one hand and to expand decentralised traffic from the federal states on the other.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna serves only as a "Production Company" for Group sister company AUA. Among other things, Barcelona and Rome would be operated with an AUA flight number, but primarily with Eurowings. Although the on-board product would be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, the pilots and flight attendants came from Eurowings. According to the report, the Eurowings flights starting under an AUA flight number will no longer be handled in Terminal 1, but in the same way as the AUA in Terminal 3.
A price war broke out at Vienna Airport following the bankruptcy of Niki. Ryanair ’ s subsidiary Laudamotion only announced on Thursday that the fleet in Vienna would be increased to 16 aircraft next summer. To this end, the Irish low-cost airline is sending four Ryanair aircraft and crews to Vienna, also in a so-called wet-lease, which the union criticised as a by-pass to the collective agreement.
In response to Ryanair ’ s CEO Michael O ’ Leary ’ s challenge that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in five years, AUA ’ s CEO Andreas Otto said on Friday: “We will remain the number one site in five, six or ten years. ”
Queen ’ s granddaughter Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children the cousins were the best friends. Now the last of the four marries. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: In Italy at the beginning of the month, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) is said to have held the hand of his friend Princess Beatrice (31), as the palace announced on Thursday.
“We are extremely pleased to announce our engagement, we are both so excited to start this adventure together and can ’ t wait to actually be married, ” said the couple, who according to British media reports have been together since October 2018, in the official announcement.
And further: "We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will help us very much in the coming years full of love and happiness".
Sister Eugenie took the pictures
The official engagement photos were taken by her sister, Princess Eugenie (29) - and published on her Instagram account.
A Royal Feast
The wedding is scheduled to take place in 2020 and the palace will announce details of the date, location and everything else in the coming months.
But it is certain that the marriage of the number nine of the British succession to the throne and the real estate mogul will be a similarly big celebration as the marriage of Eugenie on 12 October 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on causes of heart disease
Smoking, obesity, unhealthy eating - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what really triggers heart failure or an infarction? Hamburg researchers now want to take a close look at the genome of 9000 healthy and sick people.
By analysing the genetic make-up of 9000 people, Hamburg and Swiss scientists want to find out more about the causes of cardiovascular diseases.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking world, according to the University Medical Center in Hamburg, Germany. The Kühne Foundation is funding the project with 12.5 million euros. Davos Mountain Clinic, which belongs to the foundation, and Zurich University Hospital are involved from Switzerland.
Obesity, smoking and an unhealthy diet are among the major influenceable risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Genetic factors play a role in determining the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is insufficiently known. Now, the scientists want to compare the complete genetic material of 8,000 healthy people with that of 1,000 former patients of the University Heart and Vascular Centre at the UKE.
Currently, more than 4000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes are known to have potential disease-causing DNA changes - so-called mutations -, according to the clinical centre. Each year, about 200 additional mutations are reported.
According to the initiators, the aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac insufficiency and heart attacks. Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University Heart and Vascular Centre, says that the data could also be used in the research of other common diseases.
The chairman of the Kühne Gesellschaft Foundation, Klaus, Michael Kühne (82), also stressed that there was a firm will to use the data for research into other diseases. So far, the clinic of the foundation in Davos treats mainly allergies. Now, a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine is to be established on the local medical campus and a professorship for bioinformatics is to be created. To justify his commitment, the logistics entrepreneur, who lives in Switzerland, said that he had been operated on an open heart in Hamburg three years ago and was very grateful.
The bioprobes of the healthy participants come from Hamburg residents, who are also taking part in the Hamburg City Health Study. With 45,000 test persons, this is the largest local health study in the world, according to the hospital. In the genetic material decoding, strict attention is paid to the protection of anonymised data, the scientists assure. It is about one petabyte (1000 terabyte) of data, said Holger Moch from the University Hospital Zurich.
According to the UKE, the genome of a human being can be deciphered within 24 hours, at a mere material cost of 1300 Euros. The first gene sequencing worldwide, the results of which were published in 2001, cost several hundred million Euros. The study is scheduled to begin on 1 October and analyze all 9,000 samples by the end of 2020. Initial results are expected in the following year.
Nigerian police free hundreds of abused boys
In Nigeria, the police have freed more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koran school. According to instructions from local residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian town of Kaduna and discovered the victims, some of whom were minors, according to police spokesman Yakubu Sabo. "The victims were mistreated and some of them claimed to have been raped by their teachers," Sabo said.
The boys were held under the pretext of being taught and "improved" in the Koran. Indeed, the protégés were held by their teachers in "degrading and inhuman conditions", said Sabo. About a hundred students, including children aged nine, were chained in a small room.
According to the reports, the Koran school had existed for about ten years. Nearby residents had drawn the attention of the authorities to repeated irregularities in the facility. Sabo said that the parents were shocked when they were informed about the conditions in the Koran school. They had no idea of the suffering of their children.
In the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria there are many private Koran schools. They replace the often inadequate state facilities. The people in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN Refugee Agency, more than 40,000 people have therefore fled over the border to the neighbouring state of Niger in the past ten months.
Chained and Tortured: Nigerian Police Release 400 Children from School
Police officers have freed almost 400 students from appalling conditions in a school in northern Nigeria. "Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries that indicate torture," police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said in the city of Kaduna.
There the children were discovered on Thursday after a reference in an Islamic coined school. Conditions there were "inhumane", the officials arrested the headmaster and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, were kept at their school like slaves and put on chains. Some were sexually abused. Television pictures showed emaciated and injured pupils in a noticeably bad state of health.
World Football Election: Further Accusations after Messis and Klopps Freestyle
Football "Signature not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded
With a gala in Milan, the international football association Fifa honours the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. It is Lionel Messi ’ s sixth honour and thus a record.
After Nicaragua ’ s captain declared that he had never voted for the world football player, accusations are being levelled at Fifa from other countries. Egypt was not rated at all – with a curious explanation.
Many aspects of Fifa have proven to be questionable in recent years: the World Cup awards, dubious plans of its president Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt functionaries. Fifa ’ s international football selection, however, has not been suspected of being unclean – apart from the fact that the national coaches and national team captains of the member associations who are entitled to vote often vote according to sympathy rather than objective judgement.
But after Nicaragua ’ s captain had already complained that he had not voted at all, other inconsistencies now become apparent: Egypt complains that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. Indeed, they do not appear in the official and publicly accessible voting summary.
Fifa apologizes to the extent that "the signatures on the election forms were submitted in capital letters and therefore not valid." They had contacted the Egyptian federation several times to clarify the situation - without an answer.
Sudan coach also puzzled
There is also an outcry from Sudan regarding the election. While the situation in the case of Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese federation states that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote in the way it was judged: with Lionel Messi in first place, Virgil van Dijk in second and Sadio Mané in third. However, according to Fifa, the vote was the same, with signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese federation.
Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera had also made accusations: "I did not vote for the # TheBest2019 Awards. All information about my vote is wrong, thank you," he wrote. In his case, it was suspected that the Nicaraguan Football Federation simply voted on his behalf.
From the federation came now on Friday the message: True, but of course was not intentional. The filled out election documents were provided "mistakenly" with the name and the signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, it said in a communication of the federation. However, the second captain Manuel Rosas had chosen. "We take over the responsibility for the administrative error", it said in the report. However, both Rosas and team coach Henry Duarte had voted for Messi, "just as it is written in the official list of FIFA".
The other cases will now be examined by Fifa in an investigation, but emphasizes that the election process was supervised externally by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As long as Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the world football team, and Jürgen Klopp world coach of the year.
Ukraine: High-ranking Republicans support official investigation
Two senior Republicans have spoken out openly in favor of an official investigation against US President and party member Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said Vermont Republican Governor Phil Scott. "Where that leads from here will be determined by the facts that will be established." He wanted to know more about the whistleblower affair before action was taken. Impeachment proceedings can lead to the deposition of the president.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations, which showed that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the activities of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine. According to Scott, Trump has been observing Biden "for years."
Republicans have been reluctant to criticize Trump for the whistleblower affair, and few have been uneasy about it. Scott ’ s remarks are now a first sign of this in Trump ’ s party, though the moderate governor of Virginia has repeatedly opposed Trump ’ s policies, such as easing environmental regulations and tightening immigration rules.
Another senior Republican, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, also spoke out in favor of the investigation. “It ’ s a deeply disturbing situation, ” Baker said.“ The right approach and the responsibility for Congress is now to investigate the matter and get to the bottom of it. ”
Scott and Baker, as governors of U.S. states, have no formal say in the proceedings against Trump that will be decided in Congress. Therefore, their statements are above all symbolically important. Nevertheless, early Republican senators have also voiced criticism of the situation. Mitt Romney, for example, who represents Utah in the Second House of Representatives, said the case was "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing." US media also reported that the Republicans were beginning to crack internally.
The affair could culminate in the impeachment of Trump, which House Democrats have announced an investigation into, accusing him of abusing power for the purpose of exerting foreign influence for his own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for the impeachment process, and with a majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could seek impeachment, but the Senate, where Trump ’ s Republicans have the majority, would decide on impeachment, so the chances of success are slim. So far, no US president has been removed from office by impeachment.
Were torturers on board of Racketes "Sea Watch"?
Three men were arrested in Sicily and allegedly raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) had been arrested in June, after she had unauthorised headed for the port of Lampedusa with the rescue vessel "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees on board. After violent protests and international criticism - also by Austria's President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was released after a few days by an Italian judge.
Three men accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived in Italy with the "Sea-Watch 3", a detention centre in Messina (Sicily), after migrants recognised their tormentors in Italy. "We cannot rule this out, but we do not have any reliable information about it ourselves", said "Sea Watch" spokesman Ruben Neugebauer to the Deutsche Presse Agentur. "We are not in a position to make any further accusations against them."
The police reported in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had raped, tortured and even murdered Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and exposed to atrocities - through repeated and constant physical violence," the statement said at the time.
NGOs and aid organisations are now pointing out that they cannot know exactly who gets on board the ships. “We cannot scan who the people are. They come without passports, ” said Neugebauer. Torture is one of the main reasons why people are fleeing Libya. Therefore, it is quite likely that there are also perpetrators on board the ships.“ It is therefore very important that this is investigated. ”
Italy ’ s right-wing ex-interior minister, Matteo Salvini, immediately demanded an apology from Rackete, which is still under investigation in Italy for aiding and abetting illegal immigration.
Musk seeks delivery record at Tesla
Tesla ’ s chief Elon Musk has given his electric car group a powerful boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record figures.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an e-mail published by the industry blog "Electrek" to Tesla's employees.
The demand is strong, so that Tesla could register 110,000 orders, it continued in Musks circular. The challenge is to bring the cars quickly to the clientele. Tesla must provide for it at the end of the quarter as much resources as possible.
Investors liked it: Tesla ’ s shares went out of the market with a plus of over six percent. The price has not increased as strongly for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla delivered a good 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his ambitious goals. In 2019, he plans to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. To achieve this, six-figure figures must be produced in the current and coming quarters. Above all, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but the profit margins are low here. Despite the boom, there have been recent losses.
US budget dispute: Again only a bridge financing
The new fiscal year in the USA will begin on October 1 without a proper budget. On Thursday, the Senate followed the House of Representatives and approved a transitional financing until November 21.
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to increase the expenditure ceilings for the 2020 and 2021 budget years, the United States is once again facing the new fiscal year beginning on October 1 without spending plans. On Thursday, the Senate followed the House of Representatives and approved a Continuing Resolution (CR) until November 21. Without such a decision, there would have been a shutdown on Monday at midnight, a partial closure of the federal administration. President Trump has yet to enforce the decision.
Shutdown averted
For the time being, the federal administration is being financed at the same level and according to the priorities of the expenditure plans for the 2019 budget, which ends on Monday. This is due to the fact that Congress was not able to agree on the 12 expenditure laws in time, which allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities. Therefore, the federal administration cannot profit for the time being from the expenditure framework, which has been extended from $1.3 trillion to $1.4 trillion for the new budget year.
The Democrats have finalized ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they hold the majority, but the spending laws reflect Democrats ’ priorities, which have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate. Conversely, the Senate has also more or less prepared ten of the twelve spending plans, which are barely capable of gaining a majority.
In the Senate, Republicans seem to be trying to force $12 billion into the construction of the Wall, one of President Trump ’ s main priorities. Democrats are disturbed by the Wall construction plans and their funding, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The dispute over the construction of the Wall had already escalated in December 2018 and had led to a 35-day shutdown.
Opinions diverge on the construction of the Wall
It is currently unclear how the parties intend to approach this issue. An extension of the transitional financing beyond 21 November is more likely than an agreement on all twelve expenditure laws in the next seven weeks. Moreover, a shutdown is not excluded.
Against the background of the continuing inability of the congress to agree on the twelve expenditure laws in time and the associated risk of a shutdown, ideas for automating the process are gaining popularity. Presentation of page 1877 for the avoidance of shutdowns would automatically continue the financing of the federal administration at the previous year's level, would stop the travel activity of the parliamentarians and hold their wages back until the new annual expenditure plans were available.
France allows artificial insemination for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial insemination is to be open to women and lesbians living alone in the future: the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a government bill according to which all women can avail themselves of an In Vitro insemination program. Thus, the demand for anonymous sperm donations is likely to increase significantly.
In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right-wing camp had warned that in the future numerous "children without a father" could grow up. Also the French Bishops' Conference is against the innovation.
The new regulation is the core element of a bioethics law, which Health Minister Agnès Buzyn defended as a "chance" for society. It depicts the modern family, in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her, the costs of artificial insemination for all women should be borne by social security.
Fertilization with sperm from dead husband continues to be prohibited
By a narrow majority, however, the National Assembly rejected an amendment which was intended to give widows access to the sperm of their dead husband for artificial insemination. In Belgium, Spain and Great Britain, artificial insemination is permitted "post-and-mortem". In the past, there were cases in Germany in which women complained in vain about the release of the sperm of a deceased. Opponents of the advance in Paris argued that a child thus conceived would then carry a "particularly heavy fate".
Many members of the ruling party La République en Marche (The Republic on the Move, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition had spoken out in favour of artificial insemination with the sperm of the deceased partner. They stressed that a widow would be imposed a "double mourning" if her wish to have children would not be fulfilled by the death of her husband.
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it unfair that in future a widow can indeed be fertilised with the sperm of an unknown person, but not with that of her own partner.
Until now, artificial insemination has only been permitted in France for heterosexual couples who cannot conceive children and must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that surrogacy would continue to be prohibited.
In Germany, artificial insemination is theoretically open to all women - but for single or lesbian couples it is often difficult.
Compensation for the climate: Calls for flight levies for universities are louder
A lot is flown at the universities, which is why the state also wants to pay a climate levy there in the future. Rectors say they have no money for it. But now they are also coming under pressure internally.
Universities should also restrict themselves to flying. Photo: dpa / Julian Stratenschulte
The discussion on a climate levy on flights from universities and colleges, which was postponed before the summer break, is gaining momentum again. After the Regional Rectors' Conference had reacted sceptically to a corresponding initiative from the Green Black Coalition, the plans are now receiving support from the universities. In a joint statement, the doctoral students from six universities in Baden Württemberg and a pedagogical college plead for compensation for business flights. This is "urgently necessary" as a first step, and at the same time there must be a broad debate on the avoidance of flights, it says in their statement. The cabinet decision, which was originally planned in July, is meanwhile still on hold, because the CDU has still not approved the submission of the Greens.
Russia arrests North Korean fishermen again
According to the FSB, the detainees were reported to have fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea had already been arrested. At that time, there was an exchange of fire between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, and Fischer later succumbed to his serious injuries.
The North Korean fishermen were on their way to Russian territorial waters, where the Russian Coast Guard says it is patrolling to protect its marine biological resources.
30,000 Cuttlefish Confiscated
During the renewed inspections, 30,000 octopuses were discovered on the boats and confiscated. In addition, according to the information, three fishing boats and two motor boats were confiscated and brought to Nakhodka and Posjet near Vladivostok.
Russia ’ s fisheries authority also failed to issue fishing licenses to North Koreans this year, following lawsuits filed by domestic entrepreneurs. Thousands of North Korean fishermen have been arrested there temporarily this year, according to media reports.
The head of the Association of Russian Fisheries Georgi Martynov, a company in the Primorye region of the Far East, recently denounced the severe ecological damage caused by North Korean fishermen who fished with close-meshed synthetic nets prohibited in Russia. These nets would also be used to remove small creatures from the sea. Moreover, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would take 200 years to decompose.
In the future only 18.000: US lower asylum ceiling
The "most generous nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives at the White House.
The richest country in the world is closing itself off from those seeking protection: as the State Department in Washington confirms, the upper limit for the legal admission of refugees will be lowered further. In future, especially threatened believers and Iraqis will be granted asylum.
The U.S. government wants to lower the already historically low threshold for the admission of new refugees once again. In the 2020 fiscal year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, at most 18,000 people are to be allowed into the country, as the U.S. State Department stated. In the now almost past fiscal year, the limit is still at 30,000 people.
The administration of President Donald Trump has drastically reduced the acceptance of asylum seekers from all over the world in recent years. Under the previous administration of Barack Obama, much higher admission limits had been applied.
The target ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the US Refugee Program in 1980. However, the State Department called the US "the most merciful and generous nation in history," a phrase strongly reminiscent of the linguistic usage of the incumbent US president.
A "responsible approach" to refugees is aimed at allowing refugees to return to their home countries to help with reconstruction, Trump said. He has received a lot of encouragement from supporters for his tough approach to migration policy, but there is also massive criticism.
A major bone of contention is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to seal off. Trump had imposed a national emergency to finance the construction of a border wall. It is unclear whether there is a temporal connection between the current measure and current domestic developments in the US capital. Trump is currently under pressure due to the Zelensky affair and a possible impeachment procedure.
According to the foreign office, the US government intends to concentrate on the reception of two groups of refugees in the future: people who are persecuted because of their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and have thus come into danger, as stated in the declaration of the State Department. By contrast, a maximum of 1,500 refugees are to be taken in from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The United States wants to ensure that people from this "northern triangle" in Central America apply for asylum in other countries. Against this background, the United States first concluded migration agreements with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras in order to curb immigration at the US southern border with Mexico.
Court orders the release of orangutan from Zoo
An orangutan female has been transferred from the former Buenos Aires Zoo to a sanctuary for great apes in the USA at the request of the Argentine judiciary. Sandra, who was born in 1986 in Rostock Zoo, was granted the rights of a "non-human person", so her release was mandatory. On Thursday evening the animal was brought to Dallas by direct flight - not as a passenger, but in the cargo hold, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53-kilogram human monkey is unable to adapt to life in the wilderness, she is to live in the future in the outdoor enclosure of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 other orangutans and 31 chimpanzees housed, among them "Bubbles", formerly a pet of pop star Michael Jackson. Before moving into Florida, however, "Sandra" has to go through a 40 days quarantine at the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita in the US state of Kansas.
After her birth in Rostock, "Sandra" spent a few years in the former Ruhr ’ s Zoo in Gelsenkirchen before she was transferred to Buenos Aires in 1995. Initiated by animal rights activists in 2014, the trial of "Sandra ’ s" fundamental rights contributed to the transformation of the Buenos Aires Zoo into an eco-park. By 2023, a research and education centre for the preservation of biodiversity is to be established there.
Record for Swiss extreme mountaineers: 550 metres in 46 minutes
The extreme mountaineer Dani Arnold has succeeded in a new hussar ride at the almost 3000-metre-high Big Peak in the Italian Alps.
Without nets, double floors or other aids, the Swiss conquered the 550 metre high north face of the Great Tine in a new record time.
Clothed in jeans, t-shirt and supported only by absolute freedom from vertigo, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the ascent. Thus he beat the old record by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now a record holder in Free Solo Speed on four of the six most important European north faces.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
Regardless of the trade dispute with China, the US sports goods manufacturer Nike has posted a significant increase in profits, with net profits rising to 1.4 billion dollars (just under 1.3 billion euros) in the past quarter, which is 25 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, as the company announced on Tuesday. Reason for this is above all the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", with which the Adidas competitor addresses its customers directly online.
Sales rose to 10.7 billion dollars in the three-month period ending at the end of August. The strongest growth was achieved in China with sales figures of 22 percent. The Beaverton-based company in the US state of Oregon thus also benefited from its approach to direct apps to consumers via the Internet or smartphone.
CFO Andy Campion announced that Nike will continue to drive the sporting goods manufacturer's "digital transformation" with strategic investments, thereby expanding its competitive advantage.
Lifelong stadium ban due to racism in Italy
Because of racist comments about football pro Juan Jesus from AS Rom, the club from the Italian capital has banned a fan from the stadium for life. Jesus, a defender from Brazil, was insulted by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and asked his club to take action. "@ officialasroma You already know what to do with such a fan. # NoToRacism. Proud to be who I am," wrote the 28-year-old, who has been playing with AS Rom since 2016.
The club reacted late Thursday by reporting the fan ’ s account to Instagram and the police. Furthermore, Roma supporters are never allowed to attend a game of the club again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Italian fans regularly chant racist insults against black players from rival teams. "We cannot have racism in society or in sport. In Italy the situation has not improved, and this is very serious. You have to identify those responsible and throw them out of the stadiums," Fifa President Gianni Infantino said last weekend. The occasion for the statement was racist chants at the first league match between Atalanta Bergamo and AC Florence last Sunday.
The Italian authorities have now banned 38 rioting supporters of record champions Juventus from the stadium, four of whom will not be allowed to enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police said. Accordingly, bans of four to seven years apply to the others.
The fans are involved in an ongoing investigation against 12 leaders of Ultra ’ s fan groups around Juventus, accused of, among other things, extortion, money laundering and private violence, which the club launched with a complaint last year.
According to Italian media reports, the ultra-league leaders are said to be behind the black market in tickets. They have "militarily controlled" the ticket trade for the fan curve and are said to have blackmailed Juventus employees in order to get cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, Generation Z is political - entire years are given catchy names. If you take a closer look, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the respective attitudes towards life of young people?
"The crabs are coming!" With this call, crab fishing officially started at Gucheng Lake in Gaochun on September 21, heralding the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Public Relations Department of the Nanjing District Gaochun Committee.
Gaochun, which forms the southern foothills of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the National Environmental Zones. It is the first international Slow City in China and also the Chinese seat of the international Slow City Movement. The city has ideal ecological conditions with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water bodies and 50 percent fields." Gaochun's magnificent natural environment offers its inhabitants all the conditions to become rich.
The people of Gaochun started breeding prawns as early as the early 1990s. Over time, the crab industry has developed into a formative industry that has provided high incomes and has become an important part of Gaochun ’ s economic development. In recent years, Gaochun has been actively engaged in large-scale, ecological and scientific development of crab farming, as well as technology-based crab farming, and the city has taken care of promoting greater efficiency in agriculture and farmers ’ incomes.
In recent years, Gaochun has promoted a reform to "distribute power, optimize administration and government services" and has carefully built the service "permit network under one roof, a law enforcement team, a network of services, a lending platform" in order to fully optimize the permit, service and development environment.
Gaochun takes full advantage of the local advantages of its connection to southern Jiangsu and southern Anhui, and takes advantage of the development zone and its position as an international "slow city" as a showcase to locate intelligent high-end manufacturing companies, biomedical and medical technology companies, energy storage and environmental protection companies, cultural and health industries, and ecological agriculture companies that are leaders in the "3 + 2" sector. At the same time, Gaochun has promoted the development of a national all-area tourism zone and tourist destinations of national importance, incorporating the ecological and cultural resources of the Gaochun landscape, extensively improving the condition of buildings for civic services and public services, vigorously developing the "tourism +" and "+ tourism" sectors, and advancing the development of high-quality cultural tourism. It is worth looking forward to the future of Gaochun.
Iran-US Conflict: Rouhani speaks of end of sanctions – Trump disagrees
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani returned from the UN General Assembly and spoke of an alleged US offer to lift sanctions, saying that the United States had promised to end all sanctions in exchange for talks with the Tehran leadership.
US President Donald Trump, however, disagreed with his Iranian counterpart via Twitter: "Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on it so that there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no."
According to Rouhani, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and urged that a meeting be held. “And America says I ’ m lifting the sanctions, ” added Rouhani.“ And they clearly said we ’ re lifting all the sanctions, ” he added. “The type of sanctions that should be ended was up for discussion. ”
However, this move was not made in an acceptable manner, criticized Rouhani. In view of the applicable punitive measures and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure", no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
At the beginning of the week, German Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Rouhani in New York in the hope that the Europeans would save the nuclear deal with Iran that had been negotiated with Russia and China to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. French President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel, had expressed the hope on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly that Rouhani would meet US President Donald Trump.
Severe earthquake near Istanbul - Almost 200 aftershocks
After Western Turkey was shaken by two earthquakes within a very short time, the fear of a catastrophe is growing. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the quake the day before, there have been almost 200 aftershocks, said Turkish Vice-President Fuat Oktay on Friday. Thus, the fear of a catastrophe is growing.
According to Oktay, 14 schools in Istanbul have been closed for security reasons and hundreds of buildings have been damaged. Thursday ’ s 5.8 magnitude earthquake shook the Marmara region off Istanbul and caused panic in the metropolis. Oktay announced that the government now wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future.
Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes in the past 20 years, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. Inside the city itself, the latent danger is ignored time and again. Each year, poorly built residential buildings collapse - made, among other things, brittle by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
City planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open spaces, which have been registered as refuges in the city centre, have long since been added. It was not until the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük earthquake in August that the Istanbul Chamber of Civil Engineers warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake-proof.
The epicentre of Thursday ’ s earthquake lay in the Sea of Marmara in front of the district of Silivri and at a depth of around seven kilometres, as reported by the Afad civil protection authority. A minor aftershock caused even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said on Twitter that injuries or damage had not been reported at first. TRT showed people running out of houses in panic. Students were taken out of the buildings in Silivri district for security reasons and some students were crying, as can be seen in the pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. Below the Sea of Marmara lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian fault, which marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolian earth plates. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the deadliest was the earthquake in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time, more than 17,000 people died.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of the magnitude of 7.1 to 7.4 could be imminent, but it is unclear when the earthquake will occur. However, the earthquake on Thursday affected the west of the country and Istanbul again.
Businesses are designing emergency plans, private individuals have so called go ’ bags packed with everything they need standing next to front doors, and schools are teaching children how to behave when the earth shakes. It ’ s unclear when the next big quake will come.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on his return from New York that eight people had been injured and that some buildings had suffered minor damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments of the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Centre (Akom), according to which two minarets of mosques collapsed in the Avcilar and Sariyer districts.
Warning against aftershocks in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users report panic. Buildings are shaking. Schools and hospitals have been evacuated. Telephone lines have been interrupted. It has been more violent than that of Tuesday, writes a user. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Clinic, warned via Twitter of aftershocks. He called on people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
According to official figures, the time of the earthquake is 1: 59 p.m. (local time), and only a few minutes after the first earthquake, according to CNN Turkey, there was an aftershock, which was reported to have a magnitude of 4.0 on the Richter scale.
Only on Tuesday an earthquake of the strength 4.6 had shook the Turkish Marmara region - it was to be felt to Istanbul. Also its epicenter had lain in the Marmara sea west of the million-metropolis, communicated the disaster protection authority Afad already on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that made the headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan, too, was hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers believe that sooner or later there could be a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually discharge - and cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects that the earthquake is now a warning. It has become more likely, he said to CNN Türk. "This could be the signs of a larger earthquake", Ersoy said to the transmitter. "Sooner or later the big quake will come".
Already a few weeks ago there had been an incident - the quake caused great concern in Istanbul. In addition, there had been a violent earthquake in Albania only a few days ago - there were 68 injured.
Parliament: New explosive material in Ukraine
Two explosive documents fuel a new case in Ukraine over the possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible impeachment proceedings, the US Democrats feel encouraged: The complaint against Trump submitted by an anonymous whistleblower and his controversial phone conversation with the Ukrainian president provide important evidence for investigations against the president. Trump himself sees himself once again as the victim of a "witch-hunt". In addition, he doubted the credibility of the whistleblower.
USA: United Airlines passenger locked in toilet - flier redirected
Because a passenger was locked in the board, a flight has been diverted by United Airlines. The toilet door was blocked during flight 1554 from Washington to San Francisco, the airline said according to U.S. media.
During an unscheduled stopover on Wednesday evening (local time) in Denver, the woman could finally be released from the narrow cabin. About an hour she was locked up in it, wrote U.S. media with reference to other passengers. For the onward flight to San Francisco, the passengers had to change the plane.
A video broadcast on the Internet, which according to the U.S. media is said to originate from Flight 1554, shows how several people try to free the woman. "We are currently working on opening the door, Ma'am. We'll get you out soon, okay?" says one man. The airline apologized to all passengers. It was initially unclear whether the woman would receive any compensation.
The Cockroach: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan Writes Brexit Novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with all the Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous story "The Metamorphosis", the successful British author Ian McEwan (71) has written a book about Brexit and chaos in Great Britain.
The novel "Die Kakerlake" (original: "The Cockroach") will be published in German on November 27, Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) announced. It is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his former life, but is now suddenly the most powerful man in Great Britain. He sees it as his mission to put the will of the people into action and is wildly determined to let nothing or anyone stop him.
McEwan was quoted as saying: "When the parliament is closed so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, when ministers lie shamelessly as Soviet leaders once did, when Brexiteers in high positions virtually beseech the catastrophe of a No ’ deal – then a writer must ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer to it: write." McEwan's novel "Machines Like Me" on Artificial Intelligence only appeared in the spring.
Kafka's story, first published in 1915, is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself "transformed into a gigantic vermin", is gradually excluded from family and society, and finally perishes. "Ian McEwan bows to Kafka to describe a world that stands on its head," said Diogenes.
EU invests EUR 9.5 million in Austria ’ s rail infrastructure
11,200 wagons in Austria and Hungary are equipped with low-noise brakes to reduce noise pollution from freight trains. Furthermore, sections of the railway connections between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron are being modernised and electrified.
This is to make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions, according to the EU ’ s Connecting Europe Facility.
Thomas Cook: All trips cancelled until October 31
The German tour operator Thomas Cook has cancelled all trips up to and including October 31, 2019 one day after filing for insolvency. "For insolvency reasons, trips could not be started," the company announced on Thursday evening.
This also applies to bookings of the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin, which have already been paid in advance or have been paid in full. However, the company has left open the question of travel with a start date of 1 November 2019.
Thomas Cook in Germany was caught up in the bankruptcy of the British parent company and filed for insolvency on Wednesday. The company, which includes Neckermann Reisen, Öger Tours and Bucher Reisen, employs around 2,000 people in Germany.
Insurers want hotels to transfer money again immediately
However, from this Friday onwards, hotels abroad that currently still accommodate Thomas ’ Cook ’ s holidaymakers are to receive money from the Zurich Insurance Company. According to Zurich, the payments to the hotels are subject to the condition that holidaymakers are no longer requested to make extra payments.
On the basis of the booking information and without presentation of separate invoices, the hotels in the holiday resorts are now to receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesman of the German press and agency said. "This applies immediately and under the condition that Thomas ’ Cook ’ travelers are not immediately requested by these hotels to individually pay hotel invoices or otherwise compelled," said spokesman Bernd Engelien.
The insurance company reacted to reports of hotel guests who had been forced to pay for their accommodation themselves, according to their own statements, and some had to put more than 1,000 euros on the table. German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres had sharply criticised this.
How many hotels are affected, will be coordinated on Friday with the insolvent travel provider, said the insurance company spokesman. According to information from Thursday, were still 70 000 Thomas Cook-Package holidaymakers from Germany on the road. Zurich Germany has holiday and return trip Thomas Cook-secured customers.
Insolvency administrators want to try to continue the three Thomas lungen Cook companies in Germany and find a solution for the future.
The now announced disbursements at hotels by Zurich Insurance, however, help only those travelers who are currently on the road. Thomas, Cook, customers who want to fly only yet on vacation, looks bad. Late Thursday evening, the company announced that all trips to and including 31. October will be canceled. This applies to such bookings, which are already paid.
The company left open the question of travel with a start date of November 1, 2019. In coordination with the insolvency insurance company, the further procedure will be examined, it was said. In principle, the insurance company Zurich is also responsible for these cases.
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which is represented by the company Kaera. Customers could inform themselves on the Kaera website about possibilities of reimbursement of the travel price and assert their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroys blast mine in Angola
For a long time Prince Harry has continued the engagement of Lady Diana. In Africa he is now directly following in the footsteps of his mother.
Wearing a blue splinter protection vest, British Prince Harry detonated and destroyed an explosive mine in Angola.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust near the village of Dirico, he set up the ignition circuit in front of TV cameras on Friday morning. At a safe distance, the explosive device exploded in the savannah landscape without causing any damage. Although the Halo Trust alone has destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decades-long bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1,000 minefields threatening the population.
On the fifth day of his trip to Africa, Harry set out to the city of Huambo to follow in the footsteps of his mother Diana (1961-1997), the same demolitionist who once accompanied his mother on the way she went. Diana ’ s pictures of Princess Diana walking through a cleared minefield in 1997 had gone around the world, demonstrating support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day trip to Africa since Monday, starting in the South African tourist city of Cape Town.
Stagnating Brexit negotiations: The danger of a No Deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had made a clear commitment: there will certainly be no third postponement of Brexit negotiations with him. However, what statements have been made in the case of the polarizing British people for ages? The recent judgment of the Supreme Court in Great Britain hovers like a sword of Damocles over the blonde man ’ s head. Johnson ’ s suspension of Parliament in order to stubbornly implement his Brexit course until the withdrawal date was cancelled earlier this week. Moreover, a law passed by Parliament obliges Johnson to extend the bilateral talks until 31 October in the case of failed negotiations with the EU. Johnson, however, categorically ruled this out time and again.
Boris Johnson considers deal still possible
But the pressure doesn ’ t seem to be noticeable either. Meanwhile, when visiting a hospital, he hinted that if no agreement was reached by the end of October, he would support an extension of the negotiations:
You know, we will keep to the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October.
And best of all with a deal. I am cautiously optimistic that this will work out.
And the time is running out for Brexit negotiators in Brussels. The EU and the British negotiators have about six weeks left to prevent the UK from leaving the European Union without an agreement, but the latest talks have not yet achieved a breakthrough either. An agreement by the end of October seems rather difficult to imagine at the moment. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, another postponement of the withdrawal date is in force. However, the opposition does not trust the Prime Minister ’ s words. It fears that Johnson could somehow enforce Brexit in the event of a no deal.
US authorities: more E cigarette deaths
The number of deaths related to the use of cigarettes in the U.S. has risen to twelve, and there are now 805 confirmed and likely injured in this regard, according to the U.S. Health Board CDC. According to a study in the "New England Journal of Medicine", there were already more than 900 sufferers, about 500 of them confirmed, the cause of the lung damage is still completely unclear. In Europe, no similar increase in lung damage is known, and the complaints seem to be limited to users in the U.S..
Fear of new protests in Egypt is growing
The videos of Mohammed Ali have been shared millions of times in online networks, in which the Spanish-based developer and actor calls for a “people ’ s revolution ”. Today, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, whom critics accuse of corruption and mismanagement. Ali is hoping for mass rallies with one million participants in the country ’ s central squares.
The security authorities are alarmed anyway. In the center of Cairo was already an increased police presence to observe. Several subway stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir Platz were closed. Already in recent days, the police had strengthened their road controls and searched the mobile phones of pedestrians partially for news and photos in connection with the protests.
On September 20, demonstrators also gathered around Tahrir Square.
There had been protests with hundreds of participants in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura last weekend. There had not been such an open protest in Egypt for years. Accordingly, the security forces reacted harshly to it. According to figures from the human rights organisation Human Rights Watch (HRW), almost 2,000 people have been arrested since last week. Many of them have been arbitrarily arrested - only because they were "in the wrong place at the wrong time", HRW informed detainees, citing lawyers.
The organization also criticized the censorship in the North African country. Accordingly, the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to prevent further protests against al-Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013, after he overthrew the democratically elected Islamist president Mohammed Morsi. Thousands of Islamists, government opponents, bloggers and activists have been imprisoned in recent years and partly convicted.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs returns from Greenland
The polar explorer Arved Fuchs has returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday. He was welcomed on his arrival in the port of Hamburg, including by the skipper Boris Herrmann, the climate activist Greta Thunberg with the racing yacht "Malizia" had brought across the Atlantic.
In recent months, Fuchs and a team of scientists have been investigating and documenting the consequences of global warming on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the polar explorer. He has been waiting for years for the young generation to speak. It has been known for decades that the Earth is warming. Nevertheless, many acted as if there was a planet B.
"What happens at sea often happens behind closed doors," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the littering of the oceans. Greenland's glacier ice was measured with a drone during the expedition and microplastics were fished with nets.
For his "fight for a sustainable and respectful use of the world's oceans", the polar explorer from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" at the Hamburg Climate Week. "For all of us who care about the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great example," said skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony. "He is a witness to the changes that have occurred in the Arctic in recent decades".
Expensive spaghetti in Rome: tourists paid 430 euros for pasta
430 euros for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant not far from Castel Sant ’ Angelo in Rome: two Japanese tourists seemed too much. Although the bill, which included a tip of 80 euros, was paid by the two women, they posted the receipt on Facebook, which triggered heated reactions.
"Such cases damage the reputation of Rome. We ask the police to investigate the question of whether this is a fraud," demanded a spokesman for Federagit, the Rome Tourist Guide Association, according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
The restaurant owners reacted promptly, claiming that the Japanese had ordered not only spaghetti, but also fresh fish. However, this cannot be deduced from the bill. A tip of up to 20 percent of the bill was also normal, according to the innkeeper.
A phone call to Ukraine, and everything is broken? US President Donald Trump may indeed face impeachment proceedings following the turbulent revelations of the past few days, and the Democrats now want to examine this with their investigation in the House of Representatives as soon as possible - there is talk of weeks before a decision would be taken.
At the beginning of the scandal is supposedly the telephone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The accusation of the whistleblower, who ultimately brought the conversation to the public's attention with his complaint out of concern for national security and US democracy, is monstrous: The president had abused the power of his office to use the government of another country to influence the 2020 election. He had blackmailed the dependence of Ukraine and wanted to force it to take action against a political opponent.
The core of this project can also be seen in the transcript of the conversation with Zelensky, which has since been published, although it does not contain the full text. However, the telephone conversation on July 25 is only one episode of a much larger story, in which Rudy Giuliani, his personal lawyer, is at the center alongside Trump.
The story begins in public view in May 2019, when the New York Times reports on Rudy Giuliani ’ s travel plans to Ukraine. Giuliani wants to meet with newly elected President Zelensky in Kiev, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate. “We are not interfering in an election, we are interfering in an investigation of what we have the right to do, ” he says to the newspaper.“ You might think it is inappropriate, but there is nothing illegal about it. ” Giuliani wants investigations to be pursued in Ukraine, for which there is little basis – “because this information will be very, very helpful to my client and could turn out to be helpful to my government. ”
The lawyer and former mayor of New York seems to have infected himself with right-wing conspiracy fantasies fixated on Trump ’ s opponent in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton colluded with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time, to construct a reason for Russia ’ s investigation in the US.
This is precisely the investigation that Trump will speak so prominently about on the phone to Zelensky in July. Giuliani and the president ’ s version is that former Vice President Joe Biden, who is currently a promising candidate for the Democratic presidential candidacy, as Ukraine ’ s representative to the Obama administration, has pressed for the dismissal of then-Ukrainian Attorney General Viktor Chokin in order to stop the investigation he is responsible for into the gas company, on whose board his son Hunter Biden was serving. Biden senior has been blackmailing Ukraine financially to cover up the corrupt activities of his family.
When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian attorney general should go, the investigation against the gas company had already been completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by it. Schokin himself was also accused of deeply corrupt conduct, the U.S. government was by no means the only Western partner pushing for his dismissal. Incidentally, the Obama administration even explicitly supported the investigation against the company.
Facebook and Whatsapp disruptions on Instagram: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disturbances on Instagram and Facebook. According to this, Germany, Great Britain and Spain are mainly affected. On the website allestörungen.de, users report that Facebook has not loaded since about 3.30 pm. Instagram also issues the error message that content could not be loaded. Whatsapp also seems to be affected by the disturbance, although not to the same extent.
Instagram and Co. more often affected by disruptions
This is not the first massive incident this year. As early as March and July, the services failed for several hours. And, as in the previous cases, users will mainly use Twitter this time to vent their anger.
Polish Scientists Saved in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists were rescued by the Chilean Air Force from the ice of Antarctica. They were on a dinghy and several miles away from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in the misfortune - the Chilean rescue helicopter needed less than an hour to recover.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9: 30 we received the message, just before ten we started, and a good 20 minutes later we were over the inflatable".
Poland has been operating the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, with 19 scientists working there, and the frozen researchers have been safely brought back to their research station.
Attention: Never charge your smartphone wirelessly
Practical but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi ’ standard is extremely convenient, but should not be used.
Since several new smartphones have recently appeared on the market that support wireless charging and sell very well - especially the new iPhone 11 models, we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July. Although the wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely convenient, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature sets battery
Researchers warn against wireless charging of smartphones, which according to the findings of the Univerity of Warwick is extremely harmful for the devices because of the significantly higher heat generation. If you charge a mobile phone normally with a cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. In contrast, when charging wirelessly, the researchers always measured over 30 degrees, even if the smartphone is perfectly aligned on the charging pad. If the mobile phone is located slightly next to the coil, the temperature rises even higher. In addition, the watt strength of the charging pad also increases, which in turn drives up the power consumption.
Capacity and Lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature is a decisive factor for the durability of rechargeable batteries, and every single degree plays a role in this. When charging at higher temperatures, the battery not only loses capacity, but also does not last as long as it does. Thus, the service life is shorter. Therefore, the researchers recommend that the smartphone is always charged by cable. As battery replacement in modern smartphones is always associated with high costs, this should be a helpful tip. Apple has recently even increased the cost of battery replacement - for all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is extremely convenient: Simply put the device on a corresponding charging pad - these are now even installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without annoying cable clutter and tedious plug fiddling. Since Qi (stands for inductive energy transfer) is a worldwide standard established, in which even Apple exceptionally participates, there are no restrictions. Nevertheless, according to the researchers, the technology should be used only in exceptional cases.
Everest, traffic jam Photographer: 13 Eight-thousanders in six months
According to his own statements, a Nepalese climber climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world within only six months. Purja (36) had reached the top of the Manaslu in Nepal and thus set a record, his expedition organizer informed.
The former soldier wants to climb all fourteen eight-thousanders in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible." He has already made international headlines: he took a virgin photo of mountaineers queuing up on Mount Everest in the spring.
The image of the mass crowd triggered a debate about stronger security measures on the 8848 meter high mountain and highest peak on earth. In May, eleven climbers had died during the ascent within a few days.
The ascent of the 14th eight-thousander could be a problem for Purja: At the moment, Chinese authorities are blocking the Xixabangma ’ s mountain in Tibet. Bad weather is one of the reasons for this. At the beginning of the week Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal ’ s government wants to talk to China to enable him to climb it.
Four dead elephants discovered on Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals is also a pregnant elephant cow, police spokesman said on Friday. "We suspect that the elephants were poisoned".
The four cadavers were found in a protected area near the famous and by many tourists visited former rock fortress Sigiriya. According to the police spokesman the animals were presumably between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
Almost 200 elephants are killed each year in Sri Lanka. The perpetrators are often farmers on whose land the animals had previously held themselves harmless. At the same time, around 50 people are killed by elephants each year. This usually happens when the animals move through villages built near their habitat.
It is estimated that there are only around 7,000 elephants left in Sri Lanka. Their killing is theoretically punishable by death.
Confined British oil tanker leaves Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port of Bandar Abbas more than two months after being detained by Iran, according to the Maritime Administration of Bandar Abbas, according to the IRNA. Iranian Revolutionary Guards had set up the British-flagged tanker on 19 July on charges of violating the law of the sea in the Persian Gulf.
Management of Thomas Cook in review
The responsible economic committee of the lower house wants to examine the bankruptcy of the travel giant Thomas Cook comprehensively. It is to concern thereby around the salary packages of the executive committee likewise the question why the British government did not want to help financially the enterprise struggling for survival. “We are interested in the supervision in the company as well as the control by external accountants ”, communicated the committee chairwoman Rachel Reeves in London.“ Apparently we are dealing with a bad example of management desire ”.
Experts say genes are overestimated at risk of colorectal cancer
Researchers at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) in Heidelberg have come to this conclusion in a recent study. Accordingly, other risk factors, such as familial dietary habits, probably weigh more heavily than previously assumed, which has consequences for calculating the individual risk of colorectal cancer, emphasizes the DKFZ.
Elon Musk Raises Tesla Shares
This is what Musk wrote in an e-mail published on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog "Electrek" to Tesla employees. Demand is strong, so that Tesla could register 110,000 orders, it continued in Musk's newsletter.
The challenge was to get the cars quickly to the customers. Tesla had to mobilize as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla ’ s shares went out of business with an increase of more than six percent. The price has not increased as strongly in almost four months. Tesla delivered a good 95,000 cars in the second quarter and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his ambitious goals. In 2019, he plans to deliver a total of 360 '000 to 400' 000 cars. To do this, six digit figures must be produced in the current and coming quarter of the year. Above all, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but the profit margins are low here. Despite the boom, there have been recent losses.
British government wants to evade Brexit law? Johnson reluctant
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is convoluted over whether he is looking for ways to circumvent the latest law passed by Parliament against an unregulated Brexit. Asked on Friday, he merely told journalists that his government will abide by the law.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement with the EU is reached by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "surrender law" that makes negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major had suggested on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. Johnson could use a procedural trick to postpone the entry into force of the law until after the EU has withdrawn.
Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way forward is with an agreement."
Iran seems to be ramping up uranium enrichment
Iran ’ s President Hassan Rouhani has increased the pressure on the European parties in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear agreement. “Unfortunately, the European states show incompetence or unwillingness when it comes to concrete actions, ” Rohani said on Thursday at a press conference on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York. If they do not keep their promises, he offered“ further steps ” away from the agreements of the laboriously negotiated agreement of 2015.
The background is the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which in return included the commitment to Tehran to normalize economic relations. In 2018, the US single-handedly withdrew from the agreement in order to force Iran to change course with "maximum pressure" in the Middle East policy that was deemed to be aggressive. President Donald Trump ’ s government wants to negotiate a new agreement with tougher requirements and is now relying on harsh sanctions against Tehran. Iran recently reacted to this with a re-launch of the uranium enrichment limited by the treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic is now using the centrifuges installed at the beginning of September with uranium, or at least has prepared them for use. Furthermore, according to IAEA data, Iran is preparing the installation of more than 300 other centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans are not prepared to pay their share of the deal and therefore leave the Iranians alone with the costs and burden of heavy US sanctions, suspected Rouhani. Nevertheless, there will be further talks, which hopefully would bring a solution.
Rouhani continues to deny Iran ’ s involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, the situation has changed following an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September: Germany, France and the United Kingdom followed the US assessment on Monday that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Initially, the Iranian-backed Houthi ’ s rebels in Yemen had declared their support for the attack, but this was seen as a false declaration by the US. “We have nothing to do with it, ” Rohani confirmed his position on Wednesday.
“Those who make such accusations must provide evidence, ” Rohani said. However, European leaders could not have done so in talks with him during the UN General Debate. Instead, they merely claimed that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out an attack like this. Rohani had met in recent days with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Prior to possible talks with US President Trump, Rouhani demanded that the far-reaching sanctions imposed by the US administration be lifted. He called on the government in Washington to shift to a policy of "dialogue and reason".
Comet of other star crosses solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of space. Previously, this had only been possible once. However, the comet allows conclusions to be drawn about other solar systems.
What was at first only a guess is now confirmed: An interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depth of space was named 2I / Borisov after its discoverer and has aroused the interest of astronomers all over the world.
The widely travelled comet was discovered on 30 August by amateur astronomer Gennady Borisov at the Margo ’ s Observatory in Crimea – with a homemade telescope of 65 centimetres in diameter. Follow-up observations of various observatories not only confirmed that it was an unknown comet, but also showed that it did not originate from our solar system.
After 1I / 'Oumuamua of 2017, 2I / Borisov is only the second interstellar object to be sighted during a flight through our solar system.
2I / Borisov offers astronomers a rare chance to get a close-up view of a foreign solar system before it disappears for good. Initial observations show that the interstellar comet is similar to those of our own system, as reported by the Astrophysical Institute of the Canaries. "The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometres per hour, which is much higher at this distance than the typical velocities of objects orbiting the Sun," reported Davide Farnocchia of the US space agency Nasa in a statement.
According to the analyses, the comet travels on a so-called hyperbola orbit, which leads it out of our system - and clearly of interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) announced. It is also responsible for the naming and categorization of celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar comet, which was initially led under the catalog number C / 2019 Q4, was given the designation 2I / Borisov, whereby the first part of the name indicates that it is the second interstellar object that has been discovered in our solar system.
The astronomers are lucky: In contrast to 1I / 'Oumuamua, 2I / Borisov has already been sighted during the approach, leaving many months for the researchers to investigate. "The object will reach the highest brightness in mid-December and will then be visible with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explained Farnocchia. "After that, it will only be observable with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020."
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor, with a team led by Karen Meech of the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterisation of 1I / 'Oumuamua, determining the diameter of the celestial object over 2 to 16 kilometres in an initial study. Images from the Gemini Observatory on Hawaii show a distinct tail of the comet.
Researchers at the Institute of Astrophysics of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already obtained a first so-called spectrum from the interstellar comet, which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to that of comets in our solar system, and this indicates that its composition must be similar," reported IAC, researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in ours, added de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
The IAU estimates that the discovery of two interstellar visitors within only two years suggests that these objects could open up a new way of studying certain processes in other solar systems. However, it is still difficult to estimate how frequent such visits are. One of the next interstellar visitors could possibly be intercepted by a planned satellite mission of the European Space Agency Esa.
By 2028, the agency plans to station the three-part spacecraft "Comet Interceptor" on a waiting position at a distance of 1.5 million kilometres from Earth. According to ESA Science Director Günther Hasinger, the spacecraft is to be lurking either on a still untouched, fresh comet from our own solar system, or on an interstellar visitor such as 1I / 'Oumuamua.
First Landing at Beijing ’ s New Mega ’ s Daxing Airport
Just in time for the 70th birthday of the People ’ s Republic of China, a first passenger aircraft of the China United Airlines has landed at the new mega airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a special honour for captain and crew.
Around 45 million passengers a year are to be handled at the new airport by 2022, and 72 million by 2025. China's President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion euro project. China's most recent prestige project is also called "starfish" because of its six-armed building structure.
The complex has four runways, which are to be expanded to seven and is equipped with the world ’ s largest automatic air traffic management system. A new underground train transports passengers to downtown Beijing in just 20 minutes.
Already during the construction, the Chinese had repeatedly announced that Berlin could learn from Beijing. So far, the opening of the since 2006 under construction - and much smaller - capital city airport in Germany has been postponed again and again. In Beijing, on the other hand, a first passenger landed after only four years.
New supersonic aircraft to fly from London to Sydney in 2030 in four and a half hours
From London to Sydney in only four and a half hours - of it dreams the British space agency UK Space Agency. To make this, for the 2030er years aimed at flight at supersonic speed a special drive (Synergetic Air Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which develops the enterprise Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire, quoted the U.S. transmitter CNN the agency. “This is the technology, which could accomplish this definitely ”, said agency boss Graham Turnock the transmitter.“ We speak of the 2030er years for the start-up, and the work is already very advanced ”.
A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis currently takes about 20 hours. As the only supersonic aircraft for passenger transport to date, the Concorde covered the New York route from 1976 until its closure in 2003, taking three to three and a half hours to complete. In 2000, there was an accident during the launch of a Concorde at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris in which all 109 passengers were killed. Last year, the US aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin announced plans to develop a supersonic aircraft together with the US space agency NASA, the "X" Plane. Virgin Galactic also has such developments in its programme.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high speed dot to dot", Reaction Engines writes among other things on his homepage. The Sabre "drive could be used for efficient travel with a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times as fast as the sound. In addition, such aircraft can also be used outside the Earth's atmosphere and thus make the" next generation of truly reusable creamers "possible.
Uproar in Washington: Trump wants to track down anonymous whistleblowers in Ukraine
In Ukraine, Donald Trump wants to track down possible leaks in the White House over the possible abuse of power by the US president.
"I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information," Trump told employees of the U.S. Embassy to the United Nations in New York on Thursday. The person in question was almost "a spy" and had been dealt with "a little differently" in the past than today.
This was seen as an attempt to intimidate tycoons. Actually, the event was not public. However, several US media outlets broadcast audio recordings of the speech on Friday. Democrats reacted indignantly to the President ’ s statement.
The Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives announced Tuesday that they were preparing to impeach Trump. Their accusations are based primarily on a written complaint by an anonymous intelligence official, who is making serious accusations against Trump and his administration headquarters. Large public pressure had led to the whistleblower ’ s accounts being made public on Thursday.
As part of his work, the whistleblower claims to have received information from several government officials that the US President is "using the power of his office" to get another country to interfere in his favor in the US 2020 election.
At the center of the charges is a controversial phone conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in late July, in which Trump encouraged his counterpart to investigate that could harm his political rival, Joe Biden, over the past deals of Biden ’ s son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his offspring from Ukrainian justice. Biden is ahead in the race for Democratic presidential candidacy for the 2020 election.
The whistleblower also accused the White House of cover-up with regard to Ukraine: Leading government officials had tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under cover. As usual, an electronic wording had been drawn up. However, this had been removed from a normally designated database after the conversation at the behest of White House lawyers and had instead been stored in a specially protected system. So far, only a rough conversation transcript had been published.
The whistleblower's identity is not publicly known. "The New York Times" reported that the whistleblower was an employee of the CIA.
Trump once again questioned the source ’ s credibility on Friday. In a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the so-called whistleblower had spread second-hand information that had proven to be incorrect, so there might be no tip-givers or spies.
But the way Trump spoke in New York about those who are said to have leaked information to the whistleblower sparked outrage. Nancy Pelosi, the chairman of the US House of Representatives, reacted disconcertedly, complaining that Trump ’ s statement undermined the government ’ s integrity once again.
In the House of Representatives, various inquiries have been underway against Trump and his entourage in various committees for months. Given Ukraine ’ s accusations, the Democrats are now pressing ahead with investigations with renewed vigor in order to initiate a possible impeachment procedure against Trump.
"The whistleblower has given us a roadmap for our investigation," said House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff. Trump attacked Schiff harshly, accusing him of misrepresentation, and again called for the committee chairman to step down. Trump regularly berates Schiff and called for his withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former US security and foreign-policy officials, most of whom were under both Democratic and Republican presidents, backed the Democratic impeachment investigation in a statement issued on Friday. If the allegations prove true, it would be “an unscrupulous abuse of power ” by Trump, it said.
With a majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could initiate an impeachment process, but the Senate, where Trump ’ s Republicans have the majority, would decide on impeachment, so the chances of success are slim. So far, no US president has been removed from office by an impeachment process.
VW: Jobs are "creeping" dismantled
The plans of the VW brand to further reduce costs in production could be at the expense of production in Germany and Europe. This concern drives the works council of the car manufacturer. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs of ten billion euros by 2023 by two billion euros. Of this 500 million euros should be saved this year.
The "Future Pact" negotiated between the company and the works council in 2016 provides for the elimination of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. Basically, a job can only be reduced at the car manufacturer if it is virtually proven that the associated activities are no longer necessary. In addition, employment security applies until 2029.
However, as our newspaper has now learned from members of the works council, jobs in production that are not actually available are "creepily" reduced by another means - in other words, bypassing the official course. Frequently, vacant regular positions would not be filled again.
In these cases, the works council had no possibility to force the reoccupation. Meanwhile, in many places, personnel were missing, the densification of work increased, the worries about a gradual bleeding of the vehicle plants increased. Thus, the fear that the vehicle could be gradually withdrawn from production in Germany and Europe, because it is cheaper in other parts of the world. Of VW it was only said: "An adjustment of the employment volume takes place as agreed socially compatible along the demographic curve".
The VW brand wants to standardize production even more and centrally control new projects worldwide. Also, this should reduce costs and also decisions are accelerated - behind the goal of increasing productivity and thus competitiveness. Production Director Andreas Tostmann said at a manager conference in Berlin: "Especially in uncertain times from Brexit to the impending trade war between the U.S. and China, we are well advised to make ourselves crisis-proof."
For example, this year, for the first time since 2013, production costs per vehicle would fall compared to the previous year. Tostmann told journalists that the production time for the Golf 8, which is due to be presented on 24 October in Wolfsburg, will be reduced by 1.1 hours. VW does not give exact figures on production time; according to information from our newspaper, it is approximately
20 hours.
In our region, the main plant in Wolfsburg is the only VW plant in which vehicles are produced. The plants in Braunschweig and Salzgitter manufacture components. For Wolfsburg, the rule of thumb applies internally to VW, that there must be built annually 800,000 cars, so that the plant is satisfactorily profitable. In 2018, the workload in Wolfsburg, however, was only about 700,000 vehicles - due to the decreasing demand for diesel and the problems in the conversion to the new consumption- and exhaust WLTP test method.
As Tostmann, head of production, announced last year, however, "in perspective" a million cars are to roll off the production line in Wolfsburg. This is intended to make possible the bundling of the production at the main plant - because the Zwickau plant, by converting to the location for the E "car production", is giving up the Golf "production".
In addition, the Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) SUVs will be produced in Wolfsburg. However, sales of Golf and Tiguan have recently declined, so expectations are now resting on the Golf 8. Despite all efforts to build up the e-mobility, it is intended to remain the bread and butter of Wolfsburg for the time being.
Forced into prostitution with voodoo: traffickers convicted
Young women from Nigeria have taken oaths, been smuggled into the Ruhr region and forced into prostitution, for which six suspected traffickers have been sent to prison.
Six alleged human traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced on Friday in Bochum to probation and prison terms of up to eight years and three months. The defendants had smuggled young women from Nigeria into the Ruhr area and forced them into prostitution. In order to force their obedience, the Nigerian women who wanted to leave the country had to take a ritual oath in front of a voodoo in their homeland.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought across the Mediterranean with the help of Libyan smugglers in rubber dinghies. However, the dream of a better future was not fulfilled. In Germany, they were distributed to various brothels to work off the alleged smuggling costs of an average of 25,000 euros. Therefore, the wages were completely taken from them.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the smuggling and subsequent distribution of young Nigerians to brothels in the trial. "The work made the women physically and mentally difficult," said Judge Isabel Hoffmann at the sentencing. "Some were really disgusted."
The judgments are based on commercial and gang immigration, trafficking in human beings, pimping and severe forced prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
FIn the ongoing dispute with the Lufthansa Group, the flight attendants union UFO has again threatened with strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the union will "inform on 14 October about the industrial action measures in the LH Group", said UFO executive board member Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and its subsidiary Eurowings have been refusing to negotiate with the UFO for months. It is also a question of whether the union has legally terminated collective agreements at Lufthansa.
Following a decision by the Frankfurt Labour Court, UFO now sees itself strengthened in this respect. Lufthansa wanted to establish that the collective bargaining agreements had not been terminated, and the court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and considered appealing against it. "I consider it unlikely that a second court sees the matter in a completely different light," said UFO Executive Board member Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa also submitted an application to the Higher Labour Court in Frankfurt to have the UFO ’ s status as a union reviewed in court. Lufthansa argues that the union has not appointed a board of directors with the right to represent it for months and is therefore not in a position to fulfill its role as a collective bargaining partner.
This was preceded by a fierce leadership dispute in the division union, in the course of which numerous members of the board as well as the advisory board resigned, including the long-standing head of the union, Nicoley Baublies. Because of doubts about its leadership, the UFO had suspended a referendum already begun on strikes by cabin crew at Eurowings at the end of July.
Facilitated entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa regime
Until now, Saudi Arabia has not been known as an international tourist magnet, but that is about to change, as the Persian Gulf country wants to introduce new visas.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030, it wants to increase the number of international and domestic visitors to 100 Million per year, said the Tourism Commission.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country," said Ahmad Al-Khazib, chairman of the tourism commission.
Saudi Arabia is so far difficult for tourists accessible. Visa are usually only for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with relatives in the desert state awarded. With the new rules, the arch-conservative kingdom is hoping for more revenue from the tourism business.
In mid-September, several missiles and drones struck two of the most important oil installations in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country ’ s largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churais oil field. As a result, national oil production plummeted and oil prices shot up. It should take several weeks for the Kingdom ’ s oil production to return to its old level.
Justin and Hailey Bieber Are Preparing For Wedding Party
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) prepare for their wedding party. The model posted several party photos in her Instagram stories on Thursday (local time), where she can be seen in the white wedding look. Reality ’ s star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organized a bachelorette party in Los Angeles, according to People ’ s Magazine.
Justin posted several colorful, including banana-printed suits on Instagram and asked his followers, "Help me choose my tuxedo for the wedding." According to media reports, the celebrity will marry in church next weekend.
The Biebers gave themselves the yes word a year ago in a New York registry office. At that time there had not been a larger celebration.
In a recent interview with Australian Vogue, Hailey said that the two had found a common ground after initial problems: "If you don't want to compromise, you can't have a relationship."
Two dead in plane crash in Czech Republic
Two people died in the crash of a small plane in the western part of the Czech Republic. According to the police, the wreck was discovered on Friday in a forest near the town of Mecin. According to the news, the victims were a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been looking for the plane since Thursday evening, after the crew had given an emergency signal via GPS. During the search, a military helicopter was also in use. The cause of the accident has yet to be determined. The crash site is located about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half of European tree species threatened with extinction
Apart from pests, diseases, alien species, unsustainable logging and the growth of cities are also the reasons for the threat, reported the World Conservation Union (IUCN) on Friday in Brussels. It examined the stocks of all 454 tree species known in Europe. 265 of these species are not found on any other continent. Of these, 58 per cent are at risk. 66 are already at the highest level of endangerment and are therefore on the verge of extinction.
The IUCN classifies endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "endangered", "highly endangered", "threatened with extinction" and "extinct in nature" to "extinct". In total, it lists more than 28,000 animal and plant species worldwide as endangered.
Rowan and wild horse chestnut threatened
In Germany, rowan trees (Sorbus) are the most endangered species, said one of the authors, David Allen, of the German Press Agency. "Most of them are endangered because the populations are small anyway or by the transformation or weakening of their habitats."
It also looks bad for the wild Common Horse Chestnuts. They have been considered "endangered" since 2017, level two of the IUCN scale. The Balkan miner moths pose the greatest threat in addition to a fungus. They have been spreading from south-eastern Europe over the entire continent since the 1980s and have hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild horse chestnuts (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe at less than 10,000 specimens. Not included in this assessment are the trees in cities, parks and avenues.
Shrub species and mosses also at risk
At the same time, IUCN scientists established new European red lists for molluscs, shrubs and mosses. According to the IUCN, more than a fifth of molluscs and mosses and almost half of all shrub species are threatened. This is mainly due to the destruction of the wilderness, introduced species, agricultural practices and climate change. Molluscs and snails play a key role in the recycling of nutrients in the soil and are an important source of food for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN ’ s Director of the European Office. "We need to limit the impact of humans on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority."
Istanbul earthquake: 34 injured reported
Thirty-four people were injured in the recent earthquake in Turkey. According to the figures, there were no deaths. Dozens of people had to leave their homes and 14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons, said Turkish Vice-President Fuat Oktay on Friday.
Since the earthquake the day before, there have been almost 200 aftershocks. On Thursday, the earthquake of magnitude 5.8 shook the Marmara region off Istanbul and caused panic in the metropolis.
Now the government wants to set up a commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes in the future, announced Oktay. Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes in the past 20 years, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. Below the Sea of Marmara lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian fault, which marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolian earth plates.
One of the most severe earthquakes was one of the strength 7.6 in the year 1999 in the proximity of Istanbuls. The epicentre was at that time in Gölcük southeast Istanbuls. More than 17 000 people died.
Already on Tuesday, a 4.6 magnitude quake shook the region around Istanbul and the authorities called on the residents to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) und Shakira treten in der Halbzeitshow »
Latin-born pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the mid-term show at the next American ’ s Football ’ Final Super Bowl, the singers announced on Twitter. “It won ’ t get any bigger, ” Shakira wrote about a photo of herself and Lopez. She said she was terribly excited to be on the Super ’ s Bowl stage. Miami will see the light of day on February 2, 2020.
Jennifer Lopez said she had dreamed of performing at the Super Bowl since 1996, when she saw Diana Ross fly into the sky at the half-time show. "Now it's even more special, because the NFL is 100 years old and I'm going to perform with another Latina." She couldn't wait to "show what we girls can do on the biggest stage in the world."
Shakira pointed out in a statement that she was honored to stand next to another artist on one of the biggest stages in the world and to represent Latinos and Latinas from the USA and the whole world. "And also on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that it was the first time that the two "queens" stood together on the same stage.
Shakira comes from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents come from Puerto Rico.
Fighting against falling attendance figures
The Super Bowl is the culmination of the American Football ’ s season. The game and the half-time show are among the most watched TV broadcasts in the United States. Even though you ’ ve recently dropped audience numbers, this February the spectacle attracted the fewest viewers in the United States for more than ten years. Nevertheless, there were still almost a hundred million people on average.
In the run-up to the half-time show of the previous Super Bowl, there had been turmoil: In the dispute over the handling of quarterback Colin Kaepernick, top stars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to appear last February. Finally, the pop group Maroon 5 led the half-time show - the critics were unfriendly.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, had come to his knees in the season 2016 / 17 before NFL games at the national anthem in protest against police violence and racism. With his protest Kaepernick triggered a movement, numerous players took over the gesture. This caused a great stir, U.S. President Donald Trump attacked the mostly Afro-American football "stars" sharply. Kaepernick himself is clueless since March 2017 and has not played NFL "games. He accuses the clubs of not wanting to hire him for political reasons.
Cook ’ s bankruptcy: Hotels get money from the insurance
According to a press report, the bankruptcy of the travel provider Thomas Cook is likely to cost a lot of money for some banks. High write-downs on outstanding bonds and loans are looming. Credit Suisse is also affected, writes the Financial Times in its Friday edition.
According to the report, banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or Credit Suisse would probably have to carry out a total write-down of up to 1.8 billion British pounds (around 2 billion euros) on their books, as estimates by the consulting firm AlixPartners have shown.
The creditors of bonds would have to accept write-downs of £900 million to £1 billion and the lenders between £550 million and £825 million, with the actual amounts to be written off likely to be at the upper end of the range, an expert told the paper.
How big the losses of the creditors will actually be in the end, will be shown after the end of the insolvency proceedings. A person who is close to this procedure had not too much hope. So, for example, the approximately 40 aircraft of Thomas Cook in Great Britain "old" and many of the real estate are in bad locations. Most money can probably be brought out with the sale of the airport slots as well as the brand Thomas Cook, it said further.
Rackete allegedly brought alleged murderers to Italy
SeaWatch ’ s captain, Carola Rackete, may have brought men to Italy who were said to have tortured and killed people in Libya. “We can ’ t rule this out, but we don ’ t have any reliable information about it ourselves, ” said the spokesman for the refugee organization Sea ’ s Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, to the news agency dpa.
Other migrants have recognized the three men in Italy. They are accused of raping, torturing and killing people in Libya. The alleged perpetrators were arrested in the reception camp in Messina, Italy. Neugebauer stressed that the refugee organizations could not check who they let on their ships. "They come without passports".
On 29 June, Carola Rackete had illegally brought migrants to the port of Lampedusa, ramming a ship belonging to the Italian Financial Police. On the same day, the three suspects were also said to have arrived there.
United States Warns Federal Government of Huawei
The head of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government not to trust Chinese network equipment manufacturer Huawei.
We believe the risks are too great, "Pai told Handelsblatt with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law" which obliges every company "under Chinese jurisdiction" to follow instructions from the security authorities.
The applicable law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests, "said the FCC ’ s CEO, adding that this makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
In the meantime, the Federal Government has agreed to demand a "Declaration of Confidence" from suppliers.
Initially, Berlin wanted to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "Handelsblatt", citing its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible, and the technology is not just hardware:
Especially the software is important to keep the devices up to date, because this software consists of billions of lines of program code that change with time, "said Pai.
It was “very difficult to imagine ” that a government agency,“ no matter where, would be able to check every single update in real time to detect security risks, ” the FCC ’ s chief said.
He accuses the Chinese corporation Huawei of having close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership structure is opaque, and the employee company that supposedly owns the company is not necessarily independent of the government, "Pai told Handelsblatt.
The US had evidence that government employees were placed within the company. Pai was recently in Berlin for talks to promote the US position.
Chemical factory in northern France burns: Schools closed
At night, local residents hear explosions. A gigantic wall of fire illuminates the sky above a northern French chemical factory. The fire is extinguished after hours - but the cleanup work could now take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French town of Rouen on Thursday, the schools and crèches in the region remain closed.
In twelve municipalities, the facilities would not be opened on Friday as a precautionary measure, the responsible Prefecture announced. The Interior Ministry had called on the citizens to stay in buildings as far as possible and not to expose themselves to the smoke. There were no casualties. Farmers and breeders were called upon to bring their animals inside, to protect their food and to stop harvesting for the time being.
The fire was completely extinguished on Thursday evening, the prefecture said. According to the prefecture on Twitter, there was still a risk of odour spreading after the fire was extinguished. According to the prefecture, 240 firefighters and 90 police and gendarmes were deployed at the site of the fire.
A gigantic black column of smoke had previously risen from the chemical plant. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the Lubrizol factory, which produces additives for oils, a few kilometres from the city centre.
According to the authorities, the factory in Normandy belongs to the so-called Seveso "category of hazardous sites, which are monitored in particular. In 1976, a devastating chemical accident occurred in the Italian Seveso near Milan.
The prefect of Normandy, Pierre André Durand, told the news channel BFMTV that at first no "high toxicity" had been detected in samples, but pollution of the nearby Seine could not be ruled out. Dams had been built in the river to prevent pollution, the prefecture explained.
The authorities reported that the fire broke out in the early morning at 2: 40 a.m. The cause remained unclear at first. Rouen is a regional metropolis and is located on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Finance Minister: "Germany must invest now"
French Economics and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to invest more in order to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
Germany must invest now, the sooner the better, "said Le Maire on Thursday evening when presenting the French budget for the coming year.
The Eurozone economy is weakening, the minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation worsens to take the necessary decisions ".
With regard to Germany, among other things, Le Maire said that those states that had budgetary room for manoeuvre for more investment had to act.
France does not have these room for manoeuvre, the minister added, referring to the high public debt of his country, which is more than 98 percent of the gross domestic product. French public debt must be "stabilised" and "reduced", said Le Maire.
In recent years, France has repeatedly called on Germany to increase public investment in order to stimulate the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly called on France to get its budget deficit under control.
The French budget for 2020, presented on Thursday, provides tax breaks of more than nine billion euros for households.
In doing so, the French government is reacting to protests by the Yellow Vest movement, among other things. The new level of indebtedness is expected to fall to 2.2 percent, after an expected 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson evades question on Brexit
British Prime Minister Johnson sharply criticises the "capitulation law" passed by Parliament.
The parliament is back, a law requires the British prime minister to avoid a chaos Brexit. Critics, however, fear that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole. Asked about this possibility, the Tory politician evades.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has kept quiet about whether he will impose an unregulated Brexit, despite the latest legislation passed by Parliament to prevent it. When asked about it, Johnson merely told journalists that his government would abide by the law.
The law requires the government to request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement with the EU is reached by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law" that makes negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major suggested on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law and that the prime minister could use a procedural trick to postpone the entry into force of the law until after the EU has withdrawn. Johnson said he wanted a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement."
Johnson ’ s chief adviser Dominic Cummings, meanwhile, said that he considered the political debate over Brexit a “walk in the park ” and was confident that the EU ’ s aspiration to leave the EU would come true:“ We enjoy it, we will win, we will leave the EU, don ’ t worry, ” Cummings told the British Telegraph at a book launch.
Cummings, who led the Brexit “Vote Leave ” campaign during the campaign leading up to the EU ’ s 2016 referendum, now serves as chief strategist in Downing Street, UK. He is said to be behind the uncompromising policies that led the prime minister to a near-impasse.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of Linda McCartney's camera, which has become one of the big rock 'n' roll photographers, but it doesn't always have to be the great glamour. "The Polaroid Diaries" (bags) is a photobook that dives deep into the private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 until Linda's death in 1998, was visibly proud and moved when he presented the illustrated book "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid-September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Among the illustrious guests were Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretender's "front woman" Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote on Instagram: "# ThePolaroidDiaries is a glimpse into the life of an extraordinary family from before Instagram, a celebration of the legacy of LindaMcCartney as a dedicated artist and the instant magic of polaroid film."
Linda McCartney, who studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found photography, always had the camera with her. She made thousands of Polaroids, several hundred of which are now being published for the first time in "The Polaroid Diaries".
They are portraits, still lifes, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early seventies to the late nineties. "She wanted real moments," writes the art critic Ekow Eshun in his foreword. And of course one is always at the center: her husband Paul - as you may never have seen him before.
He ’ s dancing with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, telephoning in a bathrobe with a bag on his head, or wearing shapeless Moon Boots. Sure, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but beyond the spotlight, they lived a normal life on their farms in the South of England or Scotland. According to the BBC, Mary McCartney said that she slept as a baby in a bed that her father made from old potato boxes, and it wasn ’ t always tidy with the McCartneys.
Like no other medium, Poloraid ’ s camera captures the immediate moment. Linda McCartney ’ s photographs are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than mere snapshots.
It's about the decisive click: you have to recognize when a great photo happens in front of you, and then you have to snap it at exactly the right moment, "Paul McCartney said." If you snap two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo. "And Linda would have had the gift of always capturing just the right moment." She just knew she had it, "Paul said in the essay in Eshun.
The light, the composition, the image detail and the colors are just right, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but in addition to everything anecdotal is also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes sometimes seem like abstract paintings. A perfect complement to the newly released Beatles' album "Abbey Road", which appeared exactly 50 years ago.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Despite the US sanctions against Iran, Turkey wants to continue importing oil and gas from the neighbouring country. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not stop importing oil and gas from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there, "said Erdogan in New York, where he attended the UN General Assembly.
Erdogan admitted, however, that Turkey had problems with the import of Iranian oil, as some companies had "withdrawn because of the US threats".
Nevertheless, Turkey will "continue our relations with Iran, especially on this issue and on many other issues," said the Turkish president, who has repeatedly criticized the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
Since its withdrawal from the international nuclear agreement with Iran, the US has pursued a policy of "maximum pressure" on the Islamic Republic. According to the US, Iran is secretly pursuing a nuclear program and is not complying with the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran. Tensions in the Gulf region have intensified considerably in recent months.
U.S. government wants to restrict reception of refugees
The US Department of State said Thursday that the annual ceiling of a resettlement program would be lowered from the current 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, a 40% cut.
The State Department said that while the U.S. remains committed to supporting refugees, the most important task is to protect and serve U.S. citizens, and that the U.S. immigration system is currently overloaded.
The U.S. government intends to concentrate in the future on the reception of two refugee groups: People who are persecuted because of their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are thus in danger, as the statement of the State Department shows. From Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, on the other hand, a maximum of 1500 refugees are to be taken in.
Launched in 1980, the program selects refugees from UN camps around the world and resettles them in the U.S. The ceiling of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the program ’ s history. Even the current ceiling of 30,000 is a low one. When US President Donald Trump ’ s predecessor, Barack Obama, left the White House, the number was just under 85,000.
"This is a very sad day for America," said the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. "The US will continue to damage its leadership role in protecting the world's most vulnerable people," he said.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration to the US, legally and illegally, and the US government says it expects to receive 350,000 asylum applications in the coming fiscal year. These numbers are separate from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump - "Close to a Spy"
US President Donald Trump has accused whistleblowers of espionage in the whistleblower ’ s affair. Whoever accuses the whistleblower of abuse of power of providing evidence, "comes close to being an informer," Trump said in a recording of a private event on Thursday in New York, according to several US media reports.
According to this, Trump was speaking in front of employees of the American UN Mission. When asked about the person who informed the whistleblower about controversial events in the White House, he replied, “It ’ s close to a spy. ” Then Trump added,“ Do you know what we did in the old days when we were smart? Right. The spies and betrayals, we used to handle it a bit differently than we do now. ”
The Democrats strongly criticized Trump ’ s statements, accusing him of intimidating witnesses. It was also an attempt to obstruct a congressional investigation into a possible impeachment case against him, wrote the chairs of the House of Representatives ’ foreign affairs, intelligence, and oversight committees.
The whistleblower accuses the president of having abused his office in a recently published complaint in order to ask another country to interfere in the US election of 2020. Specifically, it concerns, among other things, his controversial phone conversation with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky in the summer: In the conversation, Trump suggested to him to investigate his possible Democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump denies any wrongdoing.
It is still unclear who the whistleblower himself and his informants are. However, as the New York Times reports, the whistleblower is said to be an analyst of the CIA foreign intelligence service.
Refugee boat capsized: Baby and toddlers drown in Aegean Sea
Again and again people try to cross the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece. Regularly capsize the often far too small boats. At the sinking of a rubber dinghy seven migrants have now died - including five children.
Seven migrants died in the sinking of a rubber dinghy off the Greek island of Chios. According to the Greek coast guard, one of the victims was a baby and four other children. Accordingly, four children, three women and five men were rescued from the floods by the crew of a passing ferry.
According to the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr., the migrants had left Turkey in the morning trying to reach the small archipelago of Inousses in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inousses is located between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
It is not yet known which states the migrants come from. Currently, hundreds of migrants from Turkey are crossing over to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean Sea, mostly in boats that are much too small. Last year, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), 174 people were killed on this route.
The Who cancel concert
A US gig of the rock band The Who has come to an abrupt end due to an indisposition of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the performance on Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston, his voice failed. At the eighth song, Daltrey told the audience: "I think I should leave it as long as it is still running".
Lead ’ s guitarist Pete Townsend apologized and added that Daltrey couldn ’ t “really speak now. ” Townsend promised the audience that they would get their money ’ s worth at a restitution concert.
For Friday in Dallas and for Sunday in Denver scheduled gigs The Who cancelled. They are to be made up at a later time. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74 year old bandmate Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 Years ago.
Rental suddenly stopped: WeWork makes real estate markets tremble
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office tenant.
Within a few years, WeWork has grown from a small startup to a driving force on the world ’ s most expensive real estate markets. However, the company is now in a crisis. Landlords have to fear for billions in income.
The crisis of the office tenant WeWork threatens to upset the balance in the world ’ s largest real estate markets. A few days ago, the company sold founder Adam Neumann as CEO, postponed the planned IPO and started selling subsidiaries and assets such as the private jet for the executives in order to gain financial leeway for the coming weeks and months. Furthermore, the British Financial Times reports, among others, that WeWork has stopped the completion of new leases with immediate effect. Thus, among others, the largest tenant of office space is suddenly off the market in New York and London.
WeWork rents large office space on a long-term basis and rents it out to members at short notice, sometimes in small units. This can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations. So far, WeWork has been burning money with this business at breathtaking speed. Last year, the company made a loss of 1.6 billion dollars, with a turnover of 1.8 billion dollars. This year, the rental costs alone are said to have risen to an estimated 2.5 billion dollars due to the lease of more and more large spaces. In order to limit the loss, the new management is now said to have pulled the emergency brake and stopped renting new spaces with immediate effect.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now signed leases with terms of up to 15 years, resulting in commitments of more than 40 billion dollars. These huge liabilities could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but also for entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by the economist Dan Alpert from Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, has rented almost 300,000 square meters of office space in the past 24 months. WeWork ’ s new contracts alone ensured that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the space newly launched during this period. Without WeWork ’ s expansion, the office in the U.S. metropolis would have increased vacancy during this period, as Alpert wrote in the Business Insider. A similar situation exists in London, where WeWork now operates several dozen office locations in prime locations.
Even in the British capital, the balance in the real estate market could change noticeably without further expansion of the aggressive start-up. WeWork is the main tenant, in an office building in the centre of the financial metropolis that was bought last year by the savings bank Deka for almost 100 million euros.
Many landlords have converted their properties for the requirements of WeWork with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the property owners would probably have to write off a portion of the expected billions of income. They do not have access to the - already scarce - reserves of WeWork despite the long-term leases. Because the leasing of the individual locations of WeWork is usually carried out by specially founded subsidiaries, so-called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company is only liable within narrow limits.
Russia once again arrested many North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has once again taken action against North Korean fishermen. According to the Interfax agency, a total of 262 poachers have been arrested in the past few days who had fished illegally in the waters, according to the Russian Domestic Intelligence Service (FSB) on Friday.
Just ten days ago, 161 fishermen were arrested from North Korea. Previously, the border guards had been shot at and three of them injured, but this time there were no casualties, it was said. Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.
According to the report, the North Korean fishermen were on their way to Russian territorial waters, where the Russian Coast Guard says it is patrolling to protect its marine biological resources, and that 30,000 octopuses were discovered during the re-inspections, and that three fishing boats and two motor boats were confiscated and taken to Nakhodka and Posjet near Vladivostok. According to the Ria Novosti agency, the Coast Guard found a total of more than 8,000 violations in 2018.
The Russian fisheries authority did not issue fishing licenses to North Koreans this year, according to complaints from domestic entrepreneurs, with thousands of North Korean fishermen having been arrested there temporarily in 2019, according to the media.
The head of the Association of Russian Fisheries Georgi Martynov, a company in the Primorye region of the Far East, recently complained about the high environmental damage caused by North Korean fishermen who fished with close-meshed synthetic nets prohibited in Russia. These nets would also be used to remove small creatures from the sea. Moreover, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would take 200 years to decompose, and the ships themselves would not comply with hygienic and technical regulations.
Three members of the Russian Coast Guard were injured during the arrests last week, according to Moscow. According to the FSB, another wounded North Korean died later from his injuries. On 17 September, Russian border guards first detained a North Korean boat and then a second one after it opened fire.
U.S. impose travel ban on former President Castro
The US has imposed entry bans on former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children, according to a statement issued on Thursday by the US State Department with Castro ’ s involvement in “gross violations of human rights. ” As head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean state, Castro presides over a system in which thousands of Cubans are arbitrarily arrested and there are more than 100 political prisoners.
As chairman of the armed forces, the brother of the deceased revolutionary leader Fidel Castro is also complicit in human rights violations there through the support of the President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. "The disregard for human rights and the use of force by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro ’ s regime are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela," tweeted the American Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump had imposed entry bans on members of the Venezuelan government and the military, among others. In Venezuela, a bitter power struggle between the government and the opposition has been raging for months. The USA has imposed a whole series of sanctions on Maduro ’ s government in order to bring him to his knees and to bring the opposition leader and self-appointed interim president Juan Guaidó to power.
Cuba is considered one of Maduro ’ s closest allies. The socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of posted doctors. According to the estimation of the USA and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous secret service agents to Venezuela to help the government in the suppression of opponents of the government.
New climate protests by Fridays for Future
One week after the biggest international climate protests so far, thousands and thousands of people want to take to the streets again today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international week of climate strike, the Fridays for Future movement is once again planning actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world. New Zealand and Australia are likely to make the start before the protests move across Europe to North America, where climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to take part in a mass rally in Montreal, Canada. Demonstrators also wanted to rally in front of the White House in Washington.
It is relatively unclear how popular the world will be on this Friday after the record attendance last week. Thunberg himself was in good spirits. “Last Friday, over four million people went on strike for the climate. We ’ ll do it again this Friday! ” she wrote on Twitter. To date, there have been 6,383 actions in 170 countries as part of the strike week, she added.
Last Friday, the number of demonstrators was particularly high in Germany. According to estimates by Fridays for Future, a good third of all global demonstrators - around 1.4 million - took part in the protests in 575 German cities. According to a list of the movement, rallies are planned this time in at least 65 cities, including in cities such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on the island of Sylt, people want to take to the streets for the sake of the climate.
At the age of 15, Thunberg sat in front of the Swedish parliament in August 2018 to call on the politicians of their country to make a stronger commitment to climate protection. This has led to the development of the "Fridays for Future" movement within a short time. Pupils and students, but increasingly also scientists and other adults take part in the climate protests.
Together they demand more ambition from politicians in the fight against global warming and the impending climate catastrophe. Above all, according to the Paris climate agreement, global warming must be reduced to below 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial times.
About a month ago, after a two-week transatlantic trip, Thunberg arrived in New York with a deep-sea racing yacht. There, she had recently participated in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday, she gave an emotional speech at the UN, in which she spoke to the heads of state and government of the world in conscience. In her home city Stockholm, she had been awarded the Alternative Nobel Prize of the Right Livelihood Foundation on Wednesday for her commitment to more climate protection.
Russia prohibits smoking on the balcony
People in Russia will no longer be allowed to smoke on the balcony in the future, according to a change in fire safety. "The same applies to smoking," a spokesman for the Ministry of Emergency Situations told the Tass Agency in Moscow on Thursday.
Those who smoke nevertheless must expect a fine of 3,000 roubles (42.46 euros). If the cigarette kindles a fire, then the penalty is higher. Likewise burning candles fall under the ban according to the ministry. Also meat skewers on the balcony to grill is no longer permitted.
Strike against cybercriminals - Investigators remove servers
In the fight against crime on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time found a large server, a provider of illegal business in the Darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of having hosted numerous websites, through which internationally active criminals conducted their machinations, as operators of a data centre in a former NATO ’ s bunker in Trarbach on the Moselle.
This was reported by the Attorney General's Office in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday night in a major action. Darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
Customers of the suspects are said to have been, among others, the operators of the world's second largest darknet, "Wall Street Market", which was smashed by investigators in the spring. Also, the attack on 1.25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016 was controlled by a server in the cyber bunker, according to the Prosecutor General.
Such a hoster has been excavated for the first time in Germany, it was said. A web hoster provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
With the access action with support of special units like the GSG9 there had been searches in Germany and in the neighboring foreign countries. It had been result of nearly five years long investigations. At noon the investigators want to inform about further details.
New Global Climate Protests from Fridays for Future
One week after the biggest international climate protests so far, thousands and thousands of people want to take to the streets again today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international week of climate strike, the Fridays for Future movement once again planned actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including in cities such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine Westphalia or Westerland on the island of Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a major rally in Montreal, Canada.
Climate Defence Who are Thunberg ’ s backers?
A sense of justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that heat up the climate. It is all the more surprising that a 16-year-old girl should be holding a mirror in front of the powerful people of the time. But what is behind it? Is it helpfulness or clever marketing of a climate activist? Historical masterpiece or manipulative tactics for its own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and brings young people to rise up for a better climate-friendly world. Historically, it is not the first time in Europe that a young person manages to win a collection of children and young people for himself. As early as 1212, a child named Nicholas from Cologne felt chosen to work for a fairer world. At that time, he was also able to win a flock of young people for himself and persuade them to cross the sea to reach the Promised Land, similar to how Greta Thunberg recently set out on the trip to America with a sailboat.
But is there a dark side in this regard? Why does it need a share named "We don't have time", in order to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR-managers at her side. By the way, her mother has published a book, which has sold itself extensively, thanks to the daughter standing in the limelight. Also well-established followers of Greta Thunberg were a little indignant about the last PR-show, and / or the journey by boat was probably set up too thickly for some successors. This is also not unfounded, because the action was very good in the media worldwide and it flows a lot of money thanks to the impressive action.
Here now the opinions are divided: Is it morally correct to enrich oneself financially in saving the world? Is it still authentic, if certain circles of persons co-operate with stock exchange brokers during the world rescue action Regardless of which position is taken thereby in the long run, a critical and reflected point of view is ever more important in a democratically coined society, because the democracy lives on different opinions and discussions. Therefore it can make quite sense also apparently pious projects of certain trend setters critically to question.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crosses through our solar system
A foreign comet is currently crossing our solar system.
Astronomers' assumptions have been confirmed: A foreign comet is currently crossing our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching / Washington - Researchers have long suspected it, but now they have certainty: a comet from another star is currently crossing our solar system. It was named after its discoverer 2I / Borisov and is currently employing astronomers worldwide.
2I / Borisov: comet discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
This body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennady Borisov in the Crimea. He looked up to the sky with a self-built telescope and other follow-up observations confirmed his first suspicion. It is indeed an unknown comet, which does not come from our solar system. It is only the second of its kind, which was sighted during the flight.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to get a close-up view of a foreign solar system. Apparently, the comet resembles those of our own system, as reported by the Institute of Astrophysics of the Canaries. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), the comet is clearly of interstellar origin and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbola orbit, which leads it out of our system.
Comet was sighted before approach - and can be observed for several months
But before this happens, the astronomers can observe it in detail, because unlike its predecessor, 2I / Borisov has already been sighted during its approach, which means that it can be examined from Earth for many months. "The object will reach its highest brightness in mid-December and will then be visible with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia from NASA, the US space agency. "After that, it will only be observable with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020."
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I / 2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First findings on comet 2I / Borisov raise hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be 2 to 16 kilometres in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body seems to be similar to our comet – because, as the IAC researcher Julia de León puts it, the spectrum of the comet is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as ours, added de León ’ s colleague Javier Licandro.
The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within only two years may allow a new way of studying certain processes in other solar systems.
Time and again, the researchers are occupied by asteroids. Only recently, a giant asteroid rushed past the Earth and came dangerously close to it.
"Absolutely reprehensible": Rachel Johnson appalled by brother
Things are getting more lonely around Boris Johnson. First his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister castigates the martial language of the prime minister as "tasteless" with clear words. It's not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "fraud", contract ": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and continues to arm - at least verbally. At question time in the House of Commons on this Wednesday this met with massive indignation by the opposition, and in the meantime more critics have spoken: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told Sky News that her brother used words like capitulation, as if the opponents of an EU exit were to be "hanged, dragged, quartered, tarred and cushioned", which she considered to be utterly reprehensible, and that she did not recognise her brother's version, said Rachel Johnson, who stood for the anti-Brexit Change UK party in the EU elections.
She was particularly shocked by the fact that her brother, Jo Cox, a member of the European Parliament who was murdered by a neo-Nazi a few days before the 2016 referendum, said Boris Johnson in the House of Commons. “It is very tasteless to refer to a MP who was murdered by someone who shouted ‘ Britain first, ’ ” criticised Johnson ’ s sister, who apparently came from the far-right camp, which felt encouraged by ‘ this kind of language, ’ and for all those who mourned for her, it was very tasteless.
Cox's widower also sharply criticized the Prime Minister. "It makes me sick when Jo's name is used in this way," he tweeted. "The best way to honor her is to stand up passionately and resolutely for what you believe in, no matter what your opinion is. But you should never" demonize the other side. "He also complained that an atmosphere had been created in which attacks were more likely.
Only a few weeks ago Boris Johnson younger brother Jo resigned his office as Secretary of State and his mandate as Tory MP. "I was torn in recent months between loyalty to the family and the national interest - it is an indissoluble tension", Jo Johnson justified the step.
Johnson's language also met with sharp criticism in the church. As the Times reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that "is not worthy of this country". In a joint statement they declared: "In the past few days, the language, both in debates and outside the parliament, has been unacceptable. We should speak with respect to each other".
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform at Super Bowl
In the year of its 100th anniversary, the NFL is sending a strong signal: In the half-time show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women perform with Latin roots, promising "an explosion of fun and energy".
Latina: Super Bowl Power: Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the half-time show at the upcoming final of the US Football befinden Liga NFL, the organizers announced on Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humble to represent the Latin community alongside JLo, which has an incredible strength in the US," Shakira said in a video.
The final of the American football league, which will celebrate its 100th birthday next year, will take place on February 2 in Miami. Many people with Latin American roots live in the metropolis on the southern tip of Florida. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is of Puerto Rican origin.
"I love that the Super Bowl brings two women to the stage this time - and two Latinas," Lopez said. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world, promising for the show "an explosion of fun and energy."
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s she landed with songs such as "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" big hits and later released songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and can be seen in November in the drama "Hustlers" in German cinemas.
Shakira became well-known in Colombia as a star of a telenovela and singer. In 2001 she achieved her worldwide breakthrough with her first bilingual album and the single "Whenever, Whereever".
The announcement of the half-time guests is always eagerly awaited in the USA. This year, many see the selection as a political gesture. After all, the country is deeply divided, not least because of President Donald Trump ’ s immigration policy.
The Super Bowl is the largest U.S. sporting event and at the same time a gigantic advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones caused a sensation there. As a rule, well over 100 million viewers watch the NFL Finale, it is also very popular in Germany now.
Last year, there were political controversies in the run-up to the event. The reason for this was the quartering over the quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to stand up when playing the national anthem in protest against police violence against blacks and had been severely attacked by US President Donald Trump, among others. In solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had turned down a Super Bowl appearance - including Rihanna and Pink. Ultimately, many criticized the fact that the rock group Maroon 5 performed.
An actor and Youtuber bestows upon Egypt ’ s ruler: for the time being, however, Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad.
The two men, who have an influence on whether blood flows again on the streets of Egypt, have both spent the past week abroad. One of them was once again at Cairo airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The ex-general, who in 2013 deposed the Muslim brother Mohammed Morsi, the first freely elected head of state in the country, had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had praised Sisis' action against political Islam and had not lost a single word about the human rights violations on the Nile - in a week in which Egypt's security forces arrested hundreds of people for daring to protest against the president. He had "no reason to worry", Sisi said at the airport in the microphones of the state television. "The Egyptians cannot be misled".
To mislead, according to the President, is the attempt of the other man who currently dominates the events on the streets. Mohamed Ali stayed abroad, of course, where he resists the grip of the security forces, who would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old was known as an actor only a minority of Egyptians. Today, he is the leading voice that dominates the political discourse in the cafes, living rooms and tea rooms of the country: with his YouTube channel "Mohammed's secrets", Ali calls his compatriots to rise up against Sisi.
He addresses the head of state directly and in quite rustic language. While the people are starving, the president indulges in luxury and lets magnificent new palaces be built, it says there. Ali accuses the army leadership on which Sisi bases his rule of corruption and enrichment. Because he did business with exactly these gentlemen for 15 years in his second profession as a builder, he seems to know pretty well what he is talking about - at least that is the impression of many Egyptians, as the almost exploding click numbers show.
After thousands had demonstrated against his rule last week for the first time since Sisi ’ s seizure of power and nearly 2,000 citizens, among them prominent figures from civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested, Ali called for a “march of millions ” for this Friday. It was unlikely that so many people would really dare to take to the streets. However, there were occasional smaller protests, for example in Giza near Cairo as well as in the town of Kina near Luxor. Videos in social media showed protests, whose participants accused Al ’ Sisi of corruption and demanded his departure. In these protests the police also used tear gas and rubber bullets. Initially, these videos could not be independently verified.
A massive police presence was reported on Friday from the city of Mansura in the Nile Delta, where demonstrators last week tore banner portraying the president to pieces. Security forces erected checkpoints in the city and along the arterial roads. In Cairo, several underground railway stations in the city center were closed for "maintenance work," most of the streets around Tahrir Square, the heart of the 2011 revolution, were blocked. And, in Rabaa, where supporters of the toppled Muslim Brotherhood Morsi barricaded themselves in 2013 until the army set them on fire and killed up to 800 people, another measure was to prevent dissatisfied people from gathering: Sisi ’ s Future Party wanted to hold a mass rally for the president here of all places.
Mohamed Ali changed his tactics: "Our goal does not have to be Tahrir Square," Ali said to his video camera in Barcelona. "Let's not collide with police officers." However, this is not to be understood as a retreat: "All of Egypt is Tahrir Square."
If the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various check options.
Anyone who concludes an Internet contract does not need to trust blindly the speed data of the providers. Customers can check for any anomalies how much is actually achieved.
After all, the previously promised transfer rates are an integral part of the contract and should therefore also be achieved, explains the Consumer Association of Bavaria.
If the connection always seems to be much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various test options. The measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"The tests of the offerers take place however after offerer-specific defaults and are therefore not uniformly and objectively computed", gives the consumer center Bavaria on their side to consider.
If the connection is considerably slower than announced, customers can set the provider a reasonable period of time, usually 14 days, to produce the promised service. Concerned parties do this best in writing by registered letter.
If this has no effect even after repeated requests, customers can terminate the contract and claim damages under certain circumstances.
First Senior Republican for Investigation
As the first senior Republican, the Governor of Vermont has called for an impeachment investigation into US President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where that leads from here will be determined by the facts that will be established," Phil Scott said at a press conference on Thursday. He wanted to know more about the whistleblower affair before action - an impeachment procedure can lead to the deposition of the president - is taken.
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate interventions by Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine, because Trump had been watching Biden "for years."
Republicans have been reluctant to criticize Trump for the whistleblower affair, and few have been uneasy about it. Scott ’ s remarks are a first sign of this in Trump ’ s party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has repeatedly opposed Trump ’ s policies, such as easing environmental regulations and tightening immigration regulations.
Spider-Man Stays in the MCU: Another Marvel Movie Planned
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: At the end of August, it was announced that Sony and Marvel would go their separate ways in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would therefore no longer be part of the "Avengers" universe.
Now the surprise: After "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home", Spider-Man receives another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), which is reported by several US media. Accordingly, the theatrical release is already fixed: In the USA, the film is scheduled to start on July 16, 2021.
The magazine "Screenrant" quotes Marvel "Boos" Kevin Feige: "I am delighted that Spidy's path continues in the MCU. I and everyone at Marvel Studios are delighted that we can continue to work on it... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes, as Sony continues to work on his Spidey. Verses. You never know what the future will bring".
But how does it come to the sudden good news? Supposedly, Sony Marvel has made an offer. According to industry magazines, the corporation Disney, to which Marvel also belongs, would participate with 30 percent in the revenue of incoming Spider, Man, films. However, the message is not confirmed.
Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the "Suits" finale
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" has now reached the grand finale in the USA. In the last episode there were many happy endings and just as many cameo appearances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who took part in the series for many years, were paid a charming tribute. Attention, the following sections contain spoilers for the series finale.
First of all: Duchess Meghan did not return in the finale as Rachel Zane for a last goodbye, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some retrospectives showed the most memorable scenes with today's Duchess. Such as the moments of the failed and the successful wedding with Mike or how she welcomed him after his imprisonment.
But her real husband, Prince Harry, was also mentioned casually in the "Suits" finale, of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) is just walking towards the altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht, 47) makes a telling remark about his suit. Harvey, taken aback by the groom, wants to know whether he has actually put on a frock coat, only to make a quick remark: "Louis, you're not the Prince of England."
Aegean: Baby and four other children drown in boat accident
A baby and four other children drowned while a refugee boat capsized in the Aegean Sea. Seven people died in the accident, according to the Greek Coast Guard on Friday. According to the report, the nationalities are still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men could be saved.
At present, hundreds of migrants from Turkey are crossing over to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean Sea. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), 174 people were killed on this route last year. Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer has now announced his intention to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the responsible EU Commissioner, Seehofer said he wanted to be informed in Turkey about "how things stand with regard to the refugee situation" on Friday. Afterwards, he wanted to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens in order to be able to help in coping with them.
A spokeswoman for the EU Commission confirmed on Friday the planned trip of Seehofer with the EU Commissioner for Home Affairs Dimitris Avramopoulos and France's Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
An unusually high number of migrants from Turkey continue to arrive in Greece. On Tuesday alone, 654 people transferred to the Greek islands, according to the Greek Ministry for the Protection of Citizens on Wednesday.
Does Turkey ’ s Deal Still Work?
The increased numbers have recently raised doubts about the functioning of the EU ’ s 2016 agreement with Turkey, which allows the EU to repatriate all refugees and migrants who arrive illegally to the Greek islands via Turkey. In return, the EU wanted to accept a Syrian refugee from Turkey for every Syrian deported.
On the Greek side, however, the processing of asylum applications is only progressing slowly due to a lack of staff. According to the Ministry for Civil Protection, almost 29,400 people are waiting on Lesvos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos. The worst situation is on Lesvos: At present, 5,200 migrants are accommodated in a camp with capacity for 650 people.
Never before have there been so many refugees since the entry into force of the EU / Turkey Refugee Pact in March 2016, reported the state radio.
Climate change: Heat leads to more heart attacks
According to physicians, climate change will put the health system to the test in the future. Climate changes are "quite certain" one of the biggest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, President of the German Society of Cardiology. Especially the cardiovascular system caused high temperatures and large temperature jumps within a short time and led increasingly to heart attacks. Especially people with cardiovascular diseases, elderly people and diabetics are affected.
Green politician has to answer for embarrassing photo breakdown
The leader of the Canadian Green Party, Elizabeth May, during the election campaign - was the cup manipulated for this reason?
The Canadian Green Party boss holds in a photo a multi-way cup in his hand. But now came out: The cup was manipulated.
Ottawa / Canada - It went unnoticed for quite a while - and finally caught the eye. Elizabeth May, the leader of the Canadian Green Party, never held the reusable coffee mug with metal straw in her hand. On the party's website, she was seen on a photo with this mug, talking to citizens. However, the photo had already been published and also distributed to the media - and the mug was still a despicable (cardboard) mug, as the Canadian National Post reported.
Green Party leader has to answer for photo breakdown
The National Post then accused May of manipulation, and accused the party of producing fake news in order to gain credibility on the issue of environmental protection, in the midst of a campaign for the House of Commons, in which Trudeau, too, is increasingly struggling because of a bribery scandal.
The photo went viral on social media and sparked discussion about fake news. A user shares a juxtaposition of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their chairman to conceal their disposable cup."
May was shocked and claimed on her blog not to have known about this action. To underline this, she immediately posted the original: She, talking to citizens, a cup in her hand. However, she put it right, is made of bamboo. She always has it with her. A spokeswoman of the party said, it was only about to place the party logo in the picture, and not to cover up something. Of the photo can be seen on the website only a detail.
May writes that she is sorry for the employee who did this. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she says to the Guardian and at the same time asks something of her over-engaged team: "If they want to work on an image again, could they not do something with my face so that I look younger?"
Also the German Greens are because of their use of disposable plastic or because of air travel in Shitstorms - their pictures were not fotoshops. So the head of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, ate on holiday ice cream with plastic spoon, as reported merkur.de *.
Influencerin wants Free Upgrade: Lifelong flight ban at Cathay
Allegedly Jaqueline Ng was promised an upgrade by mail from Cathay Pacific. But when she asked for it at the check in, she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontaneously get an upgrade for Business Class - this is what many passengers dream of. Sometimes they are lucky and the check-in staff offer a change from Economy Class free of charge.
This case shows, however, how not to do it: A self-declared influencer has asked the airline Cathay Pacific actively for a free upgrade. On Instagram follow Jaqueline Ng more than 65.000 Users. On 30. Never it flew back from Taiwan to New York and on 7. June.
On the outward flight, employees refused to upgrade Jaqueline, although she had shown an email in which Cathay Pacific allegedly promised her an upgrade. Influencerin said to have received the letter from a marketing team member of the airline. However, the airline accused Jaqueline of forging the mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to obtain an upgrade for the long-haul flight. This time, the woman is said to have shown the same mail, but with a different reference number. The employees at JFK airport were sceptical: They checked with the headquarters. And, in fact, the employee, from whom the mail supposedly originated, denied the mail contact with Jaqueline. This was also confirmed by the mail system, in which the messages did not appear.
The airline ’ s employees at the airport cancelled Jaqueline ’ s ticket and imposed a lifelong flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For 1,400 US dollars (around 1,280 euros), she had to buy a new flight ticket to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencerin turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that represents consumer interests, because although Cathay had reimbursed her for her original ticket, Jaqueline also claimed back the costs of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: For Cathay, the influencerin has committed fraud, she remains blocked for future flights. Furthermore, the airline's terms and conditions state that it does not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with it - and now turns to a lawyer.
Oil prices down following ceasefire report in Yemen
Oil prices fell by more than one dollar at midday on Friday. Most recently, a barrel (159 liters) of the North Sea variety Brent cost 61.83 US dollars - about 1.4 percent less than the previous day. The price of a barrel of the American variety West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to 55.77 dollars.
The price slide was triggered by a Wall Street Journal report on a ceasefire in Yemen. Saudi Arabia is said to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
In mid-September, a drone attack on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia had brought five percent of the world ’ s oil production to a standstill. Meanwhile, the Iranian-allied Houthi rebels in Yemen ’ s civil war country had claimed responsibility for the attacks. Saudi Arabia, like the US government, blames Iran. A ceasefire would defuse the political tension in the region.
If an agreement is reached, the focus can be on growth and demand, said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, Bloomberg news agency.
Oil prices are thus continuing the downward trend of the past few days. A week ago, a barrel of WTI still cost up to nearly 59 dollars, Brent nearly 65 dollars.
More recently, Bloomberg, citing insiders, reported that repair work on oil plants in Saudi Arabia is progressing faster than expected following the attack in mid-September. According to the report, the production volume has again reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and is moving back towards the original quantity.
Recently, there have been several press releases referring to insiders, which report on rapid progress of the state oil company Saudi Aramco in the repair work. However, commodity experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco currently plans an IPO and wants to avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, some easing in the conflict between Iran and Western countries has been indicated: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is on its way to leave the port more than two months after being arrested by Iran and the recently granted clearance. Now, the crew is preparing the departure, while the ship is still at anchor, Shipping Manager Erik Hånell informed Swedish Radio on Friday morning in a text message.
However, the US announced that it would redeploy defensive missiles and soldiers to Iran ’ s arch-enemy in Saudi Arabia. Fear of escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the US and the United Kingdom had temporarily pushed up oil prices considerably in recent weeks.
Accusations against Trump intensify
According to an anonymous whistleblower, in the case of the possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, allegations of cover-up against the White House have been heard. Several senior officials have made intensive efforts to prevent access to the wording of the conversation after a controversial telephone conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the end of July. Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi explicitly accused the White House of "cover-up." Trump spoke of a "witch-hunt."
North Korea ’ s Third Trump and Kim Summit in Question
North Korea has raised doubts that a third summit between rulers Kim Jong Il and US President Donald Trump will soon take place in the nuclear dispute, but the purpose and prospects of such a meeting are questionable due to the lack of progress in implementing the first summit agreements in Singapore, said senior diplomat Kim Kye gwan on Friday, according to the agency KCNA.
The US has done nothing to implement the decisions of the summit last year, said the advisor to the North Korean State Department. He also criticised the US sanctions and the joint military manoeuvres of the US and South Korea. However, he hopes for a "wise" and "courageous" decision by Trump, so that a rapprochement can come again.
Trump said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim would bring before he agreed to do so. Negotiations on the disarmament of North Korea ’ s nuclear and missile program have stalled since the failed second Trump / Kim summit in Hanoi in February. Then, in June, the two met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states, agreeing to revive the talks, but with little success.
Prince Harry: Weapon manufacturers to help clear mines
Wearing a blue splinter protection vest, British Prince Harry symbolically detonated and destroyed an explosive mine in Angola. Near a camp of the British Halo Trust near the village of Dirico, he manufactured the ignition circuit. At a safe distance, the explosive exploded. In view of the goal of getting Angola mine-free by 2025, he later demanded in front of running TV cameras: "I call on all countries whose names are on these weapons, but which have not helped to clear them away, to commit themselves to help."
Pound under pressure - interest rate cut expected
British pound under pressure
With interest rates falling soon, the pound is falling against the euro.
Frankfurt Speculation of an imminent interest rate cut by the Bank of England (BoE) is hitting the pound sterling, with the British currency sinking by up to 0.4 percent to $1.2269 on Friday.
Sales were triggered by statements by central banker Michael Saunders, who raised the issue of lowering interest rates, even if a chaotic Brexit could be averted, as uncertainty would affect the UK economy in the foreseeable future. Saunders ’ statement was surprising, as he was seen as an advocate of a restrictive monetary policy, said analyst Ricardo Evangelista of Brokerhaus ActivTrades.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the economic burden of Brexit, without directly signaling an interest rate cut. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to lead his country out of the EU on October 31, if necessary, even without a divorce agreement.
More: With his provocations, the British Prime Minister has taken a high risk. However, it could pay off for him, says Handelsblatt, editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Further Russian manipulations proven
This is confirmed by David Howman, former director of the World Antidoping Agency (Wada) and current head of the integrity of the World Federation of Athletics.
At the start of the World Championships in Athletics, new details about the doping scandal in Russia come to light - and they destroy the little credibility that Russian sport had regained at the beginning of the year and even only partially. In January 2019, the Moscow doping laboratory finally delivered the required samples from the years 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti Doping Agency (Wada).
In December 2014, systematic fraud in Russian sports was revealed, after which the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) was closed for three years by Wada. During this period, Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. After individual testing at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, the International Olympic Committee allowed around 270 athletes from the country to compete under a neutral flag; 168 Russian athletes took part in the Winter Games in February 2018. They were also allowed to take part in the World Cups in the various sports, and in the summer, Russia even hosted the Football World Cup.
Positive findings missing
The following September, the Wada repealed Rusada ’ s ban, but requested access to the laboratory and to the samples in question, in order to clarify the extent of the cover-up of doping cases in state doping, and to help punish athletes after the event. Finally, three months later, the data were delivered.
The Chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the World Athletics Federation (IAAF) has now confirmed that doping has been manipulated data from the Moscow Analysis Laboratory. "Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the task force has received the right data," said David Howman in an interview with the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" on Friday. "We have identified numerous discrepancies between the data that the Wada received from a whistleblower and those that it received from the Russians in January." Many positive findings mentioned in the McLaren's report were missing.
The World Cup not affected
This confirms the IAAF ’ s stance: the Athletics Association is the only organisation to maintain the ban on Russia. Thirty Russian athletes will start at the World Championships in Doha under a neutral flag. They had to prove that they are training outside the Russian system and undergo tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada had already brought manipulations into the room and asked Russia to respond to the accusations within three weeks. Russia is now threatening to ban the Rusada again and, in the worst case scenario, to be excluded from the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
