This not only proves that dinosaurs had wings, a widely accepted theory, but also adds to the knowledge that the fossil record of animals and plants is color and three-dimensional structure.
Scientists have described the wings that cover the body of this animal as white on top and red or carotenoid on the bottom.
These patterns provide clues to the way the wings of birds change with the seasons.
Because dinosaur wings do not have a fully developed shaft called the rachis, but instead have a structure called the barbs and barbules, researchers have concluded that the rachis may have evolved as a complex structure as its shape changed over time.
The design of the wings suggests that they were not used for flight but for measuring temperature or to indicate motion. Researchers have suggested that this is a reference to the wings of the dinosaurs, which are smaller than those of the Earth.
The researchers concluded that, if the tail was a small dinosaur, the shape used would represent the wings of an animal rather than the earth.

The experiment by Hershey and Chae was one of the first to suggest that DNA is encoded by genes.
Hershey and Chase sent phages, or viruses, to insert their DNA into the bacterium.
Two types of reactions occur in the DNA of the phage and the radioactive phosphorus or protein of the phage containing radioactive sulfur.
Mutations in the gene can be of different types depending on the type of mutation, the amount of the gene mutation and whether or not the mutation is caused by a germ-line mutation.

To show the proper handling of a car on the road, a correlation is established between three characteristics: (1) speed, (2) steadiness and (3) speed
This cooperation can help in planning, organizing and managing the road infrastructure.
