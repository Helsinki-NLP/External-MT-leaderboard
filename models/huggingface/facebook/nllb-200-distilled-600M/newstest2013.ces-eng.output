Republican Party strategy against Obama's re-election
Republican leaders have justified their policies on the need to combat electoral fraud.
But Brennan's Center calls such fraud a myth, with election fraud less common in the U.S. than the number of people who die from lightning strikes.
Republican lawyers, by the way, have only recorded 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in the last ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures will undermine the American democratic system in part.
Unlike Canada, the United States has a responsibility to organise federal elections.
And in this spirit, most U.S. governments have been enacting new laws since 2009, making it harder to vote or get on the ballot.
This phenomenon has seen a surge since the November 2010 election, during which 675 new Republicans were added in 26 states.
As a result, 180 voting restrictive bills were introduced in 41 states in 2011 alone.
New election laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
These laws also limit the time for early voting, invalidate the right to register on election day and deprive citizens of the right to vote with a criminal record.
Before the 2006 election, no U.S. state required a photo ID card to be submitted to the voters.
The first state to introduce this requirement was Indiana.
The constitutionality of the Indian Act was upheld by the US Supreme Court in 2008.
The Republican authorities have been quick to extend this procedure to other countries.
Over the past two years, they have supported such laws in 34 states to force voters to submit photo ID cards.
It should be noted that unlike in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal ID card, such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not own any photo ID issued by their state government.
Moreover, about five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an identity card.
In addition, getting the required ID card often costs more than $100.
The new restrictions are disproportionate, particularly for young people, minorities and low-income people.
25% of African Americans, 15% of those with incomes below $35,000; 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 therefore do not have the required photo ID.
And that's not all.
Students who are known as voters for their support of Democratic candidates are not allowed to use their school photo ID in several states.
On the other hand, the same States allow members of hunting or fishing clubs who choose rather Republican candidates to use the cards issued by those clubs in elections.
Until 2004, no state required a proof of citizenship in elections.
Arizona was the first to make such a demand.
Since 2011, about a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the number of votes cast by the Hispanic minority.
It's worth noting that two out of three Hispanics prefer the Democratic Party.
Republican lawmakers in 2011 passed laws in eight states that cancel voter registration on election day.
They also restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who wish to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general election, the electoral campaigns helped register about 10 million people.
However, measures taken after 2009 led to a 17% decrease in new voter enrollment in 2010 compared to 2006.
Republican lawmakers in five other states then passed laws aimed at shortening the time frame for early elections.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida, African Americans made up 33% of early voters, even though there were only 13% of African-American voters in that state.
The Hispanics were the same way.
They made up only 11% of all voters, but 24% of citizens voting in advance.
On the other hand, whites, who made up 76% of all voters, made up only 46% of those who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic lawmakers and their supporters have been very strong against passing laws restricting voter registration.
Democratic governors have blocked several bills with their sentences.
In an effort to suspend the most controversial laws, the United States Attorney General even intervened.
They managed to reduce some of the damage.
For example, only 16 of 34 states have passed laws requiring a photo ID.
However, the new rules are making the exercise of the right to vote in 2012 quite undeniably difficult.
Democratic critics speak primarily of the predisposition of the laws passed and see them as an apparent attempt to influence the results of the 2012 elections in key states.
The Brennan Center's 2011 report shows that the states where these laws were passed represent 171 of the 270 votes in the electoral college needed to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the electoral level will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is for sure now: these new provisions will have an adverse effect on voting.
In this sense, these measures will undermine the American democratic system in part.
Prostate cancer detection: to get tested or not?
The PSA test produced only false results that were incorrectly negative or even incorrectly positive, leading to unnecessary medical procedures.
All this further increased the hesitancy of men who were already so reluctant to go for an investigation.
To get tested or not?
We've asked two experts for their opinion.
Studies conducted in the USA have shown high levels of contamination between individual test groups, so it is difficult to interpret these results and to make valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found a difference in mortality between patients who were tested and those who were not.
This study also showed that after a 12-year hiatus, those who did not get tested had a 30 to 40% higher risk of metastases.
So I recommend testing from the age of 50 or 40 if your immediate family member had prostate cancer.
African-American men are also the most at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once the cancer is discovered.
There are aggressive cancers and there are non-cancerous cancers.
It is therefore necessary to properly explain to the patient the extent of the risk of his cancer, to offer him possible alternatives, not necessarily to treat prostate cancer which has no long-term impact on life, and to focus on active disease surveillance in these cases.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer do not seek treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
We'll suggest active surveillance and treatments if the disease progresses.
More and more often and with greater precision, we are setting criteria that help us decide which species to treat and which not.
I still recommend you get tested.
However, it is important to have an interview with your doctor and decide whether or not to undergo a medical examination.
Movember, in cooperation with the International Urological Society, has developed a tool to assess the pros and cons of PSA investigations.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous cure for cancer.
Despite advances in research, adopting healthy lifestyle principles seems to be the best way to reduce disease risk.
It is estimated that if everyone ate healthy and moved around enough, up to 30% of cancer cases could be prevented.
"If everyone stopped smoking, that number would rise to at least 50 percent", stresses André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Research Society.
In contrast, it is estimated that about 10% of cancer cases are inherited.
Some percentage also remains completely unexplained.
The Canadian Cancer Research Society has maintained its priority to combat smoking, even as the number of smokers declines.
Cigarettes account for 85 percent of lung cancer cases.
They're also a risk factor for several others.
It's extremely damaging to human health.
"There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today", says spokesman André Beaulieu.
Incentive: Ten years after a smoker quits smoking, the risk of dying from cancer falls by half.
Weight
Obesity and obesity are another risk factor for disease incidence, according to the SCC.
They increase the risk of breast, colon and rectal, pelvic, esophageal and uterine cancers.
"Research shows that regular lifelong physical activity protects against colon cancer", adds the report.
Food
The organisation also recommends limiting red meat consumption.
If consumed too much, it may lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is also appropriate to avoid marriage where the same is true.
The preservation of meat by steaming, drying or salting may lead to the production of carcinogens.
"They can cause damage to the body's cells and lead to cancer", adds the report.
Other preparations of heading 0301
Recently, various scientists have focused on the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, the research has not yet reached a definitive conclusion.
Studies focusing on vitamin E are inconsistent according to the SCC.
While one study suggests a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, other studies suggest an increase in the risk.
Neither has the effect of vitamin D on cancer been clearly demonstrated.
Mr. Beaulieu continues to insist on the importance of discussing his concerns and family history with his doctor.
"Doing a full exam doesn't mean you're gonna have cancer".
Higgs boson explored
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson caused a legitimate stir last summer.
There is an opinion that this boson is involved in a mechanism that is responsible for all the matter in the universe.
And it's also the last particle that the standard model predicts exists -- our best or least bad explanation of the nature and behavior of matter -- but it hasn't been empirically observed yet.
But physicists are still not 100% sure that it's a Higgs boson.
There's no doubt that we have a completely new particle that looks very much like the Higgs boson, as predicted by the standard model.
The new data released this week at the great Physics Congress in Kyoto confirms this, but we still lack all the data to be absolutely certain.
However, let's assume it's the Higgs boson, because the risk of error seems small, and let's see what it actually is.
In this world, there is a perfectly unquestionable law that says that two things cannot happen at the same time in the same place.
This rule cannot be circumvented - and do not try too hard or you will hurt yourself.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it does show a similar law: Pauli's exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - that "state" creates some of their properties, in a nutshell.
Then he divides the physical particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we find orderly citizens, or fermions, who obey the Pauli principle.
And at the other end are bosons, vicious anarchists who don't care about anything at all -- certainly not this principle, which means they can be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are further divided into two groups by device (except for the amazing one) which is The Particle Adventure at Berkeley Labs: mesons, which we leave unnoticed here, and "force particles", which are spread by great natural forces and with which the Higgs boson is probably somehow related.
However, it must be said that these bosons are not as exotic animals as one might think.
If you are reading this article, it is because of an unusual banality of the boson: a photon, or "particle of light", that is the "carrier" of electromagnetic force.
When an electrically charged particle accelerates or changes direction, it "disrupts" the electromagnetic field at that particular location, much like a spark thrown into a pond.
This "disturbance" produces an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing more than a photon - and thus one of the bosons, the "force carriers".
More stable field
It's the same with the Higgs boson, except that it needs to be disturbed by another field, the Higgs field, to make this boson appear.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, you have to achieve very high energy values, much like the frozen lake level, which is already lit by a very large balvan.
For this reason, it is necessary to use a part accelerator as massive as the accelerator in CERN -- a large hadron accelerator with a circular loop of 27 km! -- to produce such energy.
An analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to clarify the relationship between Higgs and matter.
Because not all particles or materials react with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold itself in the refrigerator.
And it's also true that not all particles react with the Higgs field: those that do have some matter, while the others (like the photon, let's look at it) don't.
And Mrs. Novak asks, what is all this research for, what will it bring us?
From a scientific point of view, this is a validation of the Standard Model (SM), which allows physicists to examine any inconsistency between the observation and prediction of SM.
And there are not many physicists who would literally wish that we could find them, because the slightest difference could open up the space of "new physics" and fill some gaps in the model.
It should be noted that the model still has huge flaws, it does not provide any clarification of gravity (oh!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the cosmic mass (oh again!).
CERN has not yet discovered such discrepancies.
Other
The impact of these studies on Mr and Mrs Novákov's daily life can only be predicted very difficultly, but it would be a mistake to assume that there would be none.
Look: even in the early 1960s, the pioneers of laser at Bell Labs had no idea of the revolution their work would bring.
They assumed scientific use, but nothing else.
Physicist Willard Boyle -- who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam (the previous beams were pulsed) in 1962, I've already said -- the laser was initially considered to be such a "laboratory toy".
Just imagine that...
And in addition, the application can also arise from all the instruments surrounding research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969 during his work on optics.
This sensor, although Boyle initially did not plan it that way, now serves as the "eye" of all digital cameras in the world and earned him the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Of course, that doesn't mean that the activities around the LHC necessarily have to change our lives, but it does mean that you really never know...
Palliative care - the best way to get out of life...
Through his Commission on Death with Dignity, Quebec recently became involved in a sensitive issue concerning the end of life.
The debate should continue soon and the bill is being drafted.
Much work remains to be done in this vital area.
Le Devoir magazine tried to look at this question in more detail.
Less than a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that fed him gave him a two-year suspension.
"They gave me five years to live, and it's seven", he says emotionally in his bed at Victor-Gadbois' home for palliative care in Beloeil, where he had arrived the day before.
"But it's still a shock, you can't prepare for this", he adds.
The disease has done its job: an enormous weakness makes it impossible for him to go to the bathroom alone or eat alone.
He looks down on the delicious breakfast and agrees that we help him eat.
He's brave and even smiles, talks to strangers who stop by, brings him medicine, offers a bath.
The courage to die a simple death.
"My greatest wish is to get rid of the diarrhea that humiliates me", he confesses.
A few hours later, a team of doctors found a cure for his problem.
"You learn all your life that men urinate in the same place", says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois facility.
Going back to childhood is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the ability of the individual", says the psychologist.
In the opinion of a number of palliative care practitioners, the key moments are at the heart of such a return.
Patients who enter a home with Victor-Gadbois palliative care are all cancer patients.
Their prognosis is three months at most.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses who care for them do not provide so-called "medical" care.
In Mrs. A., 89, the worst fear is to die "in suffocation in full consciousness".
But the disease allowed me to discover my children.
"I have good children", he adds.
"I have no wishes in my life anymore", she says, and then she lets us put her in a breathing apparatus.
Yet, she still looks forward to her son's final visit from Italy in the days to come.
The Victor-Gadbois Home provides nutritional care in cooperation with a group of volunteers.
That's what palliative care looks like, when there's nothing else you can do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, one palliative care bed is available for every 11,700 people.
That's very little if we realize that we all die one day.
Here life continues under optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at the home.
Whether it's a level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, they can be given a brandy or a pepsi, for example, depending on their taste.
Diabetics no longer have to control their sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life here.
They brought a beer to Mr. X. Who died later that night.
His son is drinking a beer this morning to honor his late father.
"We help patients as well as their loved ones", says Nathalie Savard, director of nursing.
Victor-Gadbois's house is a day after day, but they don't look alike.
Besides a 23-year-old man who is enjoying the last encounter with his family, firmly grounded on pillows, while drinking in his honor, a 43-year-old man dies tragically surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children after trying all he could to survive.
"For six months now, there are always three to five beds available for people with cancer under 45", says Dr. Christiane Martel, who is concerned.
53% of patients who come to Victor-Gadbois' home come from their homes, 47% from hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, care designed to alleviate suffering once the patient reaches the final stage of his life, whether at home, in a hospital, or in a nursing home.
And a few organizations, like Victor-Gadbois Home and the Home Palliative Society of the Grand Montréal area, specialize more or less exclusively in oncology care.
And it is this fundamental lack of access to health care in Quebec that has led a number of palliative care physicians to fear the passage of the Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide Act.
Since October, a manifesto has been circulating, signed by leaders in palliative care such as Dr Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, in which they express their disagreement with such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's healthcare system is not efficient enough to ensure access to quality palliative care for all people before euthanasia is possible.
She says she recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days in the ER in tremendous pain without anyone taking the necessary steps to relieve her.
He fears that patients will not ask for death because they are not receiving proper care.
And at the same time, many oncologists care for their patients until the last minute, regardless of the prognosis.
Hélène Richard's survival was already minimal when she left the demanding chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist I was quitting treatment, she said she regretted that I had stopped fighting, she told us.
And she was telling me it was over!
There is no all-powerful care
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of patients who wish to die thank their doctors for not fulfilling their wishes when the painkiller team relieved their pain.
But it must be said that palliative care is not necessarily omnipotent in treating pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Grand Montréal Home Palliative Care Society, 8% of patients are denied pain treatment.
At the very end of life, doctors often use a palliative sedative that will put the patient to sleep until the moment of death, whether by accident or by continuous sedation.
We can't pretend we don't see this part of suffering.
Patients who are not relieved of pain will have an increasingly high chance of receiving palliative sedatives.
Patients who are not given sedatives always say the same thing, "I want to die".
But it doesn't always mean "I want you to give me euthanasia", it means "I want you to take my pain away".
This report was made possible by a grant for journalists from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The wide-ranging real estate scandals in Quebec
Travel officials, construction and public works entrepreneurs, political party lobbyists, and Italian mafia experts continue to tell what they know about the amazing "system" that mixes construction, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists, and mafiosi.
This 'field' was very expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially between 1990 and 2000.
"It's interesting how the system has fragmented since we took the essential measures", says Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former Montreal police chief.
In 2011, he sparked a scandal following a thorough investigation into the misappropriation of funds in connection with the Quebec road construction contracts, which the then Liberal Quebec Premier Jean Charest approved after long delays.
The Duchesneau Report confirmed a direct link between industry, opaque party financing and corruption of public officials.
"Since the inquiry began in 2010,", he says, "only the Department of Transportation has saved a billion dollars on contracts" when some people have kept their instincts to gain a share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already dismissed two mayors", adds the hope that it will "uncover the cunningness of some people".
Standing Corruption Unit established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, is also engaged in the fight against its army of government inspectors, investigators and analysts.
And the Martéau crew, who since 2009 have been making sure that the Montréal money-laundering cartel significantly eases the inflation of contracts...
In recent weeks, they have conducted a series of searches and charged a number of city councillors with fraud and corruption, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban town.
Next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third largest city.
He's suspected of repeatedly accepting bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Formal charges have already been filed against Montreal transportation engineers and Italian-born entrepreneurs such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito created a sensation by explaining to the Commission the mechanism of the "system" of public procurement.
He himself donated 3% of the value of the contracts he obtained in Montreal during those years to a mafia-linked broker who then transferred the money to the Union Montréal party, which was run by Mayor Gerald Tremblay.
Zambito was generous to all parties after 2000, donating over C$88,000 (about EUR68,000) to provincial parties, but especially the Liberals, who were in power at the time.
He also admitted to organizing an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts for cash flows whose prices are over-rated
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption was very well established.
Gilles Surprenant, a former transportation engineer, described him in great detail before the committee: For ten years, he received gifts from construction companies, invitations to to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games, and a total of $736,000 in cash in exchange for the cash prizes he had set.
Other transport authorities admitted that they had been paid a fee for overvaluing invoices by 30% to 40% through fake duplicates.
Mayor's party organizer Martin Dumont then accused Tremblaye of unabashedly keeping an eye on the concurrent budget that was bringing dirty money into his vault.
Based on these findings, Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first Montreal lawmakers to issue a warning signal.
As mayor of Rivière-des-Prairies in the east of the island, he has been fighting against the sale of a municipal land bought for $5 million and sold for... 1.6 million to developers right in the middle of a thriving real estate business since 2010.
70% of the dirty money in election campaigns
Of the investigation, which will finally be launched, he says, "he is dragging the strings in an effort to understand how the ant's system works to stop gangrene and catch the culprits".
She said the process was "painful but positive".
We're in the wound-cleaning phase, but we need to set up our own investigation unit in Montreal and ensure supervision so these questionable practices can't go back.
It's like cleaning.
I do it regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public officials have seized hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of "ambassadors informed of this fraud" if they have not gotten into these pitfalls!
He estimates that 70% of Quebec election campaign funding comes from dirty money, and ironically adds, "I've heard it's just a weakly real outfit".
The Quebec government proposes to limit party donations to $100, but it says that will not solve the situation: "Until the election spending is strictly limited, dirty money will not disappear from politics".
He proposes a comprehensive control of the public procurement and party financing system: "We can't go down any further; if we focus boldly on the bottom line, we can build on a stronger foundation and with greater control and compliance with the law".
If this story has tarnished the image of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends that anyone who mocks him should look in their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
You and PSG have set a whole new pace this season.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by the fact that all the individuals went into each other or by the whole new dimension of PSG.
We've got some big players coming.
I get closer to them every day.
The technical team helped me a lot, too.
Every day, these facts allow me to raise the level of play.
And it's easier when you're in a game.
Everything goes so fast in football.
I'm not losing my mind.
From my initial training at INF Clairefontaine to my transfer to Saint-Etienne, I've always moved up and down the stairs.
So you're using the competitive environment that Carlo Ancelotti introduced...
This summer's squad is used to playing matches at a very high level.
They also know that every training is essential.
And it turns out that a player like me has a greater appetite for the game and wants to give his best performance.
And besides, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my position.
He has assistants like Claude Makelele, who played the same position as me.
And does Ancelotti have the key word at the right time?
- Of course you are.
Ancelotti has the respect of all technicians.
He's one of the best in the league today and one of the best in Europe.
He's got a lot of experience and he's won a lot of titles with top teams.
He's worked with some great players.
I think he's gonna win another title in Paris.
I had a calming interview with him in January.
I've had a number of injuries.
The trust he gives me is another reason for my performance.
How do you feel about the first part of the season at PSG?
Lyon took the lead in League One.
But we're still in the curtain.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we made it to the semi-finals very easily.
What is your club's goal in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as we can.
Now anything can happen.
But we certainly want to be a tough opponent for quality European teams.
We want to win our qualifying group first against Port so we can play home in the semi-final replay.
Can PSG become a major European club in the short term?
The budget's already...
To become a great European club, Paris must win titles and make history.
It's not like that today.
In financial terms, PSG has the means to make this plan come true.
And would it be a big failure not to win the Premier League like last season?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
We really want to win the league title this year.
We missed a lot last season.
We were disappointed in May because we had the chance to win.
We had a great season.
We've scored 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points, you're a clear champion...
But another club, Montpellier, had a season even more amazing.
I think we'll do it this year.
Even though big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are trying to win the title, I think we have the weapons to beat them.
Do you think the media expects too much from PSG?
It's not uncommon to expect too much from us given what we've invested in and the players we have.
We totally accept that.
The truth is, if we beat the Troyes 4-0 at home and there's still something in the papers that's still being read to us, it's not very pleasant.
You ask what more people can ask of you.
Of course, you can't win 4:0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game style.
You need time to build a team.
We showed at the Champions League that we can play.
Look at Manchester City, who didn't make it to the semi-finals for the second season, and they invested a lot of money!
Given the amount invested, you'd be expected to have a 15 point lead over the others!
You're insulting the other clubs and the French league.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not very good last season, have moved to the next stage with the new PSG.
That shows how amazing League One is.
I hope that in May we can smile and say to ourselves that despite all the hardships we have managed to win.
It seems that PSG relies on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic in everything.
It's good to hear that there is a "Zlatan dependence".
That means Ibrahimovic is very efficient and he scores a lot of goals.
That's what he came here for, and he's proving he's a major league star.
Everywhere he went, he proved he was a great player, a world star.
We respect both the man and the player on our team.
He respects the people around him, too.
What he's accomplished is truly extraordinary.
It led the others to raise their own level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows others to grow alongside him.
How was your experience with the French national team at Euro 2012?
It's like disappointment.
I really wanted to play in this tournament.
Unfortunately, the injury prevented me from playing as I imagined.
But I've been through it and I've come out stronger.
I'm doing well in the national team today.
And I've been hoping for that ever since I joined the national team.
We learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe it to ourselves to set an example.
How do you feel about Didier Deschamps' first months as head coach of the national team?
It's the results for him.
We're in a good position in the MS qualifiers.
Coach is strict, close to the players, and can be enthusiastic about winning.
Laurent Blanc was like that.
I don't want to compare them.
Blanc achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps leads our team to Brazil.
Is the 1-1 draw on 16 October a solid starting match in Spain?
This game has given us confidence.
We all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never seen a match like this in my career.
Bitcoin allows you to pay and sell without banks
All negatives of current central bank-based financial transactions, identified transactions and processing costs between recipients.
In addition, as is often true in these technologies, there is a clear political perspective: the belief that the existing financial system based on banking monopolies leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), is both virtual money (transferable to dollars, euros...), and a secure transfer protocol similar to BitTorrent that allows file sharing between two partners.
With 15,000 computers connected to the network, some 200,000 transactions have already been registered.
About a thousand websites are already accepting bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The Bitcoin exchange rate first peaked at $30 (€23) in June 2011, dropped to $2 five months later, and now stands at about $10 (a price index is available at bitcoincharts.com).
Compared to the world's exchange for real money or financial products, it's nothing impressive.
And yet the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this fact in its report on virtual finance, which was released in October.
He describes Bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "competing the dollar and euro", and "the era of coinage".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual money in that it is like "credits" used for video game progress that a person can earn by playing a game or that can be bought (and sometimes exchanged back).
The social network Facebook has developed a similar system.
Each month, however, the Central Authority checks and processes individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all nodes in the network are current account holders, controllers, money issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two email addresses.
However, the user may choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
The information set relating to this transaction shall be electronically signed by a double-key encryption system.
The network can verify the validity of the transaction.
The contents of the file also ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist in the public ledger of current accounts distributed throughout the network.
The key stage is to record this new transaction in this book.
It is done by solving a mathematical task assigned to computers, the solver of which, as a temporary central banker, will be entitled to write this supplementary line.
It's a file-slicing phase, which is the transformation of a huge file into a shorter, unique digital print.
Computers will "take" this new transaction and add a number to it, only then to "cut" the whole thing.
The aim is to find a number that provides a specific print (about zero at the beginning).
Once this number is found, it's easy for the other nodes to check for its correctness.
The transaction is then displayed indelibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification would alter the print.
If a user wants to pay twice the same money very quickly (within 10 minutes) for fraud, the network will confirm only one of the two transactions - the other will be abandoned because each has a different print.
The computer that solves the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, these rewards are divided into two regularly, probably by the end of 2012.
So the number of bitcoins in circulation is limited to 21 million, but you can divide them up to a billion, so the margin space here is...
The difficulty of the task is also increasing with increasing levels of computation.
The network has seen its ups and downs.
Web sites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and the stored bitcoins have been stolen.
"The used bill does not concern the protocol itself", assures Pierre Noizat, founder of Paymium, a real-money payments company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also monitors the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But that's the problem with cash.
Major players like Wikipedia reject gifts of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blogging platform, are taking them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel recently analyzed the current account ledger and showed that almost 80% of bitcoin is offline.
In November, "giant discounts" were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged", rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, a bitcoin gold conversion firm.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a textbook on this money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to credit cards (with real money) or contactless mobile payments, but uses the Bitcoin system to verify transactions that are cheaper.
In addition, the wearer manages his identity and can remain anonymous.
The system is easily configured by traders without the need to install new terminals or software.
Just give an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by phone, says Pierre Noizat, who assures that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to question hierarchical systems and move to more horizontal systems.
"Bitcoin will take some time to take hold, but 2013 could be a defining year", he predicts.
In addition, the ECB envisages in its report a reassessment of the various risks which are now considered to be increased if this type of money is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French forces have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and US forces should follow by the end of 2014.
It's time for the Afghan army to take control of their territory and for the Afghans to choose their own future and not expect anything from us.
The worst damage was done to people in rural Afghanistan who we punished for considering terrorists.
And so did we, since we lost 88 soldiers killed, and all those injuries and crippling.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but they are often peasants who reject the presence of foreign armies as they did in Soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks have joined them.
They now experience tolerance and frequent support from local insurgents, but if Western forces withdraw, their support will decline.
The withdrawal of French troops from the base of the Nijrab, which I watched from the tops of the mountains planted with almonds thanks to French loans, went on in order.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles arrived in Kabul without an airborne helicopter attack.
The Taliban will not be as active in Kabul by the end of 2014.
Since their unstoppable proceeding in 1994-96, conditions have changed considerably.
At that time, Kabul was empty and the land was covered in blood and fire as a result of fighting between various resistance groups.
Their takeover of the land was then considered a kind of liberation, a return to safety.
The Afghans paid the price for the brutality of these peasants, who were completely controlled by al Qaeda, but their situation has not improved to this day.
The Mujahideen in the past, the Afghan government and the current Taliban are all working together to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main ranking officers of the war against Soviet forces returned to power in 2001.
They became dealers, seized state land, sold it as construction land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and used huge U.S. subcontracting contracts.
They were discredited; most of them, moreover, had never been in combat.
From what I've heard in the campaign, people long for a government that thieves won't create.
Many young people want to leave the way those who have been able to use American generosity leave: capital leakage is considerable.
The young are already tired of war and its ideology.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they learned about the modern world and were fascinated by its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; there are currently 5 million inhabitants in Kabul, a fifth of the total population.
The cities are full of public schools, girls and boys.
These young people will have to be given jobs, they no longer want to go back to the darkness of the old parties or the corruption of some officials.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, likes mobile phones; they watch TV and Turkish TV shows that show the modern world everywhere.
The army is already here.
Will the offices that stand in her way be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the Soviet army are already rebuilding provincial militias that will be out of the control of the central government.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong local identity, should enjoy some degree of decentralization on the Western model, but the US wanted to turn it into a centralized country with strong presidential influence, so the post of prime minister was abolished, which had existed since the adoption of the constitution in 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially not in the elections scheduled for the fall of 2014.
However, his country has been heavily dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and earlier.
No industry has been restored, no dam is working, no major irrigation system is being repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced, only fruits and vegetables.
The priority is private initiative.
In a country ravaged by three decades of war, government control of infrastructure would be necessary.
Rumors spread that Afghanistan has huge mineral wealth.
And it just made me feel like the Western world was here to take over.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper on site and without means to transport raw materials across the mountains but no mining can take place.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the Mes Aynak copper mine and have given international archaeological teams (with the support of the World Bank) the opportunity to explore the vast Buddhist site to maintain their role as the most important employer in the entire province.
One day, Afghanistan and Pakistan, which depend on a large part of imports and exports, will also need to restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of the usual types of aid: girls' and boys' secondary schools, departments of French at universities, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, the 'getting heart and soul' initiative has been working on the difficult task of reconciling aid and military activities, and the Ministry of Defence's 'civil-military steps' service (Cimic) has been working on it since 2012, but thanks to the numerous French NGOs, it has achieved a number of successes in the field of common interest and agricultural regeneration in dozens of mountain villages.
These efforts, involving a large number of local workers, helped quell the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection, and the expansion of cropland.
What will we leave behind after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very difficult in these valleys, which are often found above 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural aid from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to free themselves from the insurgency led by foreign groups, these farmers claim to be seeking to obtain small civil assistance for their benefit, which would be properly controlled and directly affected.
Difficult work at the Egyptian Institute
President Muhammad Morsi has taken on another poker game.
While Egypt remains the most divided country in its history due to the promulgation of a constitution that temporarily grants it unlimited powers, it has decided to play the vabank.
On Wednesday, he announced that, regardless of the opinion of all others, the Constituent Assembly would approve the final text tomorrow.
Less than a week ago, the head of state gave the assembly two months to complete the necessary work.
For almost two years, Egypt has been using a provisional text that has been amended many times, weakening the country's constitutional stability and leading to legal disputes.
This new initiative only increased the fragmentation of the country.
From the opposition's perspective, the president continues his "autocratic delirium", continues to "breach his word" and "crush the law".
However, its supporters assure that this is a means to address the constitutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held in two weeks.
It is a very short period of time that will force the Brotherhood to back down from the intention of the Egyptians to clarify article by article.
For the president, it's also a way to regain national and democratic legitimacy while he's stirring up protests across the country.
As he confirmed in an interview with the American weekly Time, Muhammad Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favor.
Especially since this hastily organized vote puts the Egyptian people before an ultimatum: "Either you approve my text or I will keep my unlimited powers", which would otherwise have expired once the new constitution was approved.
And in this particular atmosphere yesterday, 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, with a large majority of Islamists, approved the text.
Most liberals were absent from the vote.
In mid-November, shortly before the Constitution was promulgated, they knocked on the door saying they had no chance to impose their views.
Human rights advocates, civil society, and religious minorities have embraced their approach.
To achieve the capacity, 11 replacement personnel were added in a hurry yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising, then, that articles of the Constitution were often voted unanimously.
Commentators continued to comment that one of the few disputes that day was centered around... prayer hours, when some committee members held the view that the hours in the meeting room were not properly arranged.
The text, which was voted on last night, consists of 234 articles.
The general point of view, Article 2, ultimately remains consistent with the 1971 version of the Constitution, which states that "the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law".
Salafist parties, for whom the introduction of Islamic law is a fundamental requirement, hoped to replace the term 'principle' with the term 'rule' to allow for stricter enforcement.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been corrected is a sign of their goodwill and respect for the rest of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy", the liberals claim, who see it as a rhetorical problem.
They say that the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They focus in particular on Article 220, which confers on al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular on the question of verifying compliance with Sharia law.
According to Egyptologist Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing because "people invited to speak are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
This can be seen as the beginning of theocracy".
The liberals' concerns are further compounded by the fact that the next university chancellor should be less moderate than the current one.
"So far, there has been no concrete religious impact.
With this constitution, Egypt remains a framework civil state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not Ulamites, but university workers, many of whom studied in French schools", said Alexis Blouet, a mildly concerned Egyptian who is preparing work on the constitutional transition.
However, he agrees that "there may be differences in the interpretation of Article 220 because the terms used in it are part of the religious dictionary.
In particular, there is a reference to 'fiqh' [Islamic Law, cf. ed.].
And in the future, the question may arise as to the extent to which civil judges are competent to speak".
The text adopted yesterday is under much criticism, apart from the religious aspects, because of the expanded powers it grants to the president of the republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that there has been a significant reduction in their status compared to the previous regime.
Another disputed area: the powers vested in the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the army officials, the verification of the defence budget will not be carried out by Parliament but by the National Defence Council.
Furthermore, civil proceedings in military courts will not be prohibited as requested by the human rights association.
The association is discussing its doubts in the context of a text which it considers to be against freedom.
The penalty for blasphemy is maintained and insulting is prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, particularly for the press.
In addition, no article deals with women's protection, stresses Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
The only positive point, she said, is the prohibition of torture in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to make a televised speech last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of state will then demonstrate on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are awaiting holy sites, the world's crust and sea of salt-saturated salt
The Promised Land combines the greatness of Bible truths, modern comfort, and the integrity of nature.
AaF has identified five of the most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Worship the Holy Places
Visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is claimed that all who enter this "compassion" will have divine mercy.
And Galilee - the place of Jesus' miracles: turning water into wine at a wedding, walking on water, calming a storm, and filling up the nets.
Here too Jesus appeared to his disciples after his resurrection.
But the most holy places are in Jerusalem.
Here, believers walk the Way of Pain, or the Way of Jesus on the Cross (Latin: Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the Fortress of Antonia - Pretoria - where the trial was held, passes through the streets of the Old City and leads to the Temple of God's tomb on Mount Golgotha - the place of the crucifixion, the place of the anointing stone, and the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is the symbolic Christian world's cradle, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
And the Holy Cross Monastery in Jerusalem was built on the site where, according to Christian legend, a tree grew from which they made the cross for Jesus' crucifixion.
Jerusalem also contains the holiest place for Jews - the Wall of Mourning, the remnant of the temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, people of different faiths leave wishes in the book and they are then fulfilled.
To make a vertical journey
The ruins of Masada Castle were left behind by a secret hiding place from the enemy that Herod the Great had built for his family in 25 B.C.E.
The wreckage is located on the cliffs in the mountains at 450 meters above sea level.
Only mountaineers can get to it by their own power.
The rest of us will ride a cable car to this historic mountain.
And in the north of the country, at an altitude of 1,600 to 2040 m, there is the famous Hermon ski resort, which experiences a huge influx of tourists in the winter months.
A pickup bus takes tourists from the foothills of the hill to this ski paradise.
The total length of the mountain slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient legend, pagan gods lived on the top of the mountain.
Visiting unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can't visit all of them on one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are definitely worth a visit.
Among them is the Israel Museum, which is located near the Knesset (parliament).
It houses ancient Kumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls, found in the Judean Desert caves, and some 500,000 archaeological and anthropological artifacts.
The Tel Aviv Museum of Art is also worth a visit.
The exhibition features the works of the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akkon, you can visit the Al Basha Bath Museum, which presents visitors with several rooms of ancient Turkish spas with statues of bath users and bath nurses from that time.
In Caesarea, the unique private Ralli Museum is worth a visit, where you can admire the statues of Dali and Rodin.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are strictly denied.
The fifth museum, the Holocaust Museum, or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells the story of one of the most dramatic moments in history.
The most tragic part of the museum - the Children's Memorial - was built in memory of the 1.5 million children who were murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You walk in -- and you're in complete darkness.
The stars are shining.
And they sound like the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries where they died.
Ukraine is also involved.
Improving Your Health
Israel's three main spa centers are located on the shores of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Seas.
Each has a pool, water park, dolphinarium, and oceanarium.
Interestingly, the Red Sea is also a winter swimming spot, as the water temperature does not drop below 21 degrees Fahrenheit and the air warms up to 23 degrees Fahrenheit.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and people bathe in it all year long.
The Dead Sea is by far the most extraordinary sea in the world, located in the lowest point on the planet - 417 meters below sea level.
The azure water is a saturated saline solution that can easily keep people who can't swim at sea on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is unrealistically beautiful.
Come here for treatment using salt water - saline - and medicinal mud that can treat health problems like dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, to cure the damaged nerves.
Touch the Mystery of the Ancient Past
It is protected by the ancient part of Tel Aviv, a small town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
The famous sea route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia passed through them.
Mention of this city is found in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it is the place where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they then lived a long and happy life together.
Tourists really love the narrow alleys named after the zodiac signs.
They say if you press against the walls in the alleyway of your sign, happiness will be favorably inclined.
In Jaffa, you may meet newlyweds who come from all over Israel and even other countries to get their pictures taken.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk through the Roman theater and "conquer" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the seat of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully renovated theater is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists, please.
If you're going to Israel, you don't have to worry about your imperfect English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian in this country.
It is better to take money with you not in euros but in dollars, which you can easily exchange for shekels (now $1 is about 3.8 shekels).
The city's main transportation is by buses, but in Jerusalem there is a high-speed tram, and in Haifa there is the only metro line in the country with six stations that connects the lower city to the upper one.
It's basically an underground cable car.
Traveling by all types of city public transport costs 6 shekels, which you can take with a transfer for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition holds the Sabbath.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, the markets, shops and public transportation will be closed.
And Sunday morning is the start of the work week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels, you can only get kosher food: except for pork, seafood, fish without shells, and foods containing a mixture of milk and meat.
They offer a wide selection of lamb and beef dishes, soups and desserts made from coconut milk, traditional Jewish hummus, a variety of sauces, and grilled pork chops - falafel, fruit, and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many feeding cats who gracefully "walk according to their taste".
In the evenings, you can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
The caterpillars love crowded places and will indulge in any goodness.
The car rental will range from $37 a day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 a day (Audi A6, Volvo S80), depending on the car's brand.
Plus insurance - $15 a day.
And borrowing a bike will cost about 15 shekels a day.
Tickets to the museum cost an average of 30 shekels.
Expressed numbers
In 2012, Israel was visited by more than three million tourists from around the world.
The most citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine came to know and rest.
The Promised Land received 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists from January to October 2012, up 51% from the same period in 2010, before the visa was cancelled on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" announces to Moscow: Emigrants will save money on language
While lawmakers and human rights defenders are still debating the compulsory language test bill, fraudsters have already appeared in the country selling "fake" certificates
13 million foreign workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities every year.
Most of them are Central Asian citizens: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make enough money to support families at home.
On 1 December, a law came into force that requires every migrant worker to take a Russian language test.
So far, this rule only applies to those who intend to work in the services, housing and communal economy, lifestyle and retail sectors.
However, the FMS promises that in time, appropriate tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
However, the examinations will consist not only of language knowledge but also of Russian history and the foundations of law.
The language knowledge will also be required to be confirmed for obtaining and renewing a work permit.
The derogation applies only to nationals of countries where Russian is the official language.
This law does not apply to persons who have successfully obtained a diploma or certificate before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Use, conviction and protection of rights
The network of test sites will operate under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of the Russian Language, the University of Friendship between Nations, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take the exam in any city; more than 160 such centers are already open in Russia.
The initiative to support the introduction of testing was also supported by the Members of the State Duma and the FMS (Federal Migration Service).
But before the law went into effect, human rights defenders were able to ask the press many times: What will it actually bring?
What will change the obligation to know the language for Russians and for visitors themselves?
First of all, they say, this will help to reduce the number of people suffering from "slave labour".
Many people today talk about protecting the rights of migrant workers, explains FMS Russia's Tajikistan board chairman Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights should be initiated before their departure.
Only an organised recruitment system will allow 90% of foreign workers to solve their problems.
Problems arise with unemployed, uneducated immigrants who do not speak the language and have no medical examination.
Without knowledge of the language, he says convincedly, the future migrant is condemned to clash with dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "waybill" to the horrible, tight shelters where he and dozens of others like himself will be starving for months without food and documents and working 12 to 14 hours a day.
We've been getting a lot of complaints from our migrant workers.
"They promise them one thing in their homeland, but when they arrive they will cheat them, confiscate their passports, and fail to pay their promised wages", confirms the head of the Tajik Central Administration for Labour Migration, MS Tolib Sharipov.
Don't you think!
Not so much that many citizens of the Central Asian republics who intend to go to Russia for work admit not only that they do not know the language of the country they want to go to but that they do not even have experience with the work.
Of course, it is not their fault, but rather their misfortune: very few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajik can afford to get at least adequate basic education.
Their families also need to feed their children, not to mention dress, camp, and school equipment.
As children reach their productive age, they must go to work at the earliest opportunity.
Without knowledge of the language, it's hard, they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior".
True, with regard to the language test act, human rights defenders point to one important point.
The testing will only be carried out on migrants with legal status.
If they don't have it, they won't take the exams or get any more official jobs.
Meanwhile, most migrant workers are living in Russia as illegally as they used to.
"Welcome, or Unlicensed Entrance Forbidden"
Many of the incoming workers say that gaining official status in our country is not easy.
The reason is the bureaucratic obstacles and all the language difficulties.
Legalisation costs money, from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But a fake license can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
Russian police know we have essentially fake documents, no registration, and that leads to blackmail cases.
"They require a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea", Tajik citizen Umed Chuchkadamov told reporters about his experience.
"Come on, don't be greedy, buy yourself a painting"
On the first day of the language law's entry into force, it was found that not only immigrant registration documents were fake.
FMS staff have already seized several false certificates of passing the language exam.
Forged documents are printed on a regular colour printer.
Of course, the new owners did not get it for free: each of the migrants, hoping to make it easier for them to pass the tests, paid 7,000 rubles for the document.
That's two and a half times the amount of money that passing the official test will cost migrant workers 3,000 rubles.
The main task of the near future is to secure the system from corruption so that workers cannot simply buy documents, government officials and human rights defenders agree.
Government authorities can promise foreign workers who fail their first examinations the time they need to complete a basic course in Russian.
Visitors who do not speak Russian are expected to work in areas where active interaction with people is not required.
The Ministry of Interior does not circulate the illegal arms market
The crime rate for using legally held weapons is very low.
The Russian MVD is proposing to tighten the law on civilian gun owners.
It's the government's response to recent events: the wedding shootings that went uninjured and the massacre prepared by Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinogradov that killed seven people.
The police want to ban the carrying of dangerous weapons in public places and raise the age at which a gun can be licensed from 18 to 21.
This is supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Combating Corruption Irina Jarovaja, who promised that the amendments to the gun law will be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied that Russian state authorities are trying to solve the problem by "pulling screws".
An open letter appeared on the network, the authors of which - representatives of various social shooting organizations - demanded the rejection of the "senseless tightening" of the law.
The percentage of registered gun perpetrators is minimal, said Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminal investigator in an interview with the BBC in Russia.
According to the Ministry of Interior statistics, 142 offences involving the use of firearms registered with the Ministry of Interior authorities were committed in the six months of 2012, while a total of 1168 thousand offences were committed in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the tightening of the civil arms laws will not force the offender to go to the black market.
According to them, any weapon can be found in Moscow at a low price.
At present, the Interior Ministry claims that the situation with the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from races to officers
The black market for guns is being supplied through several channels.
There are five main channels, says retired Colonel Victor Baraněc, who worked for ten years in the workplaces of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of the pages that accept weapons orders
The first of these is "army or military road", meaning a weapon that was taken from the Caucasus.
"The Russian officers and the caucasians themselves stole the weapons", says Lamb.
Another type of "black weapons" is weapons stolen by criminals from security officials.
Baranec explains that this includes theft from police warehouses and weapons stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal "main" are being sold from military warehouses.
Many military depots are frequently bombarded.
"It has been shown that some fires were started deliberately - to cover the fire", says the former soldier.
According to Barance, the arms manufacturers also contribute.
"Currently, private arms companies are emerging that are not competitive on the international market and are eliminating weapons they supply to the black market, including Moscow", says the expert.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
Especially large numbers of pistols and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is their production, sometimes there are small arms manufacturing, and a mafia has emerged that organized their smooth production", explains the former soldier.
Where'd the gun come from?
The experts have calculated the approximate share of the individual sources of illegal arms supplies to the black market.
The report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Administration Design.
Specialists have collected reports from the Ministry of Interior and the Russian Statistical Office, criminal literature and data from public data portals focused on the subject of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, researchers say, come from military and law enforcement agencies.
Half of all weapons have been placed on the black market "by officials whose work is linked to weapons", says the report.
According to the data available to researchers, 17% of weapons come from armed conflicts, 14% of the cases were stolen while they were being manufactured, 5% are "black archaeology".
A salesman-consultant at one of the arms dealerships, who asked not to be named, believes that weapons found in black "archaeologists' excavations have long since been bought - they are simply too old.
Most often, he says, salesmen go straight to the military warehouses to get new shipments.
Through the battalion, the interested party will buy a unit, like a TT gun.
You order a gun from him, and he sells it to you over the fence.
"He takes her to the city and sells her for 900 euros a piece with two trays", she says.
"The truth is that the police are well-versed, and that's why whenever they start to get a plan to clear up crime, they'll make a check purchase from illegal arms dealers", adds the adviser.
"Like in a luxury store"
The seller and the buyer are most often in contact with each other through their acquaintances.
I went to websites and blogs until a guy showed up and offered me the option of going to the "Trial" platform, where there would be a man to lead me to the "corner" where we would be dealing together.
I didn't know the price until I got there.
The reporting officer is Viktor Baraněc.
If I want to get a gun, I need a friend who knows the way out, says the salesman - the counselor. - I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him at all.
The sellers are in the market, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically "from Mr. Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to declare that the daughter's tooth fell out".
And now I'm getting there through a man I'm sure of.
He's also only gonna give it to me because he knows I won't.
Beginners look for weapons in a variety of ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baraněc tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was working on a book about the subject.
He said the schematics didn't change.
They gave him a photo album with "everything you thought of".
"I felt like I was in a luxury store", recalls the soldier.
According to the Lamb, the buyer is not offered rabbits in a bag - you can try anything.
I, a potential client, just don't shop - we go out with the salesman and set a target.
"It gives me the ability to shoot, and when I'm sure the gun is firing well, we start acting", describes the expert.
A supplier on the couch
Search engines will take you to websites and groups on "Vkontakte", where you can buy weapons "for various purposes".
No papers or a personal meeting are required.
"It is enough to have a fixed amount of money", says the headline on the "Buy a fighting gun or machine gun" website.
On this page, users leave their notifications and ask questions.
And sell to minors?
'Of course without a licence,' asks the user 'Ivan' (spelling is preserved).
'I will buy TT.Moscow' - the short form of the request 'Fedorenkov.
The Federal Security Service recently decided to build a huge network of locked-in websites and anyone who wants to buy a military weapon can shovel it.
People gather like hungry fish for bait and then mine coal in Siberia.
Military intelligence officer and senior military officer Viktor Baraněc
I've heard of schemes like this: websites are usually registered outside the scope of Russian law.
People take orders.
The buyer will make the payment via the ATM.
"In response, the seller will send him a photo and a description of where the weapon is hidden", reports a spokesman for the NGO Right to Arms, Dmitry Kislov.
Viktor Baraniec confirms that after placing an order on the website you can be left without weapons and behind bars.

A macaron for $100
When you buy illegal firearms, experts estimate that you'll pay between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the NGO Right to Arms, you can buy a Makarov pistol for $100 to $300.
You'll have to wait a month to a month and a half.
The weapon shall be shipped from the warehouse to long-term storage through intermediate-level warehouses.
According to the Official Statistical Office, the total number of these crimes in Russia decreased by 7% from January to October 2011 to 22,9 thousand cases, and the number of cases of theft and extortion of arms, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7,8%.
In the US, fast food and supermarket workers are on strike
Up to a quarter of all American teenagers will be employed at McDonald's.
In recent days, there has been a wave of protests against low wages in Walmart's hypermarkets and popular fast-food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
So far, no one can predict whether this wave will turn into a wave of nine or whether it will soon be doomed to disappear.
The whole action is supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing social organisations.
In addition to the modest salaries that a number of workers at Walmart and the fast food systems receive, the protest organizers aim to create in them a presence in their trade unions.
At present, this economic sector is virtually untouched by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The events began last week after Thanksgiving, on what is known as "Black Friday", when cheap sales orgies hit America, enthralling millions of residents and in some cases accompanied by fights.
On this day, some workers at Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their workplaces and demonstrated alongside unions and left-wing activists of multinational retail chains whose products are targeted at lower and middle class people.
Walmart sells everything from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That's why many low-wage employees at Walmart stores shop only at their jobs.
Availability and product range have made Walmart one of the largest companies in America.
Critics say Walmart can afford to sell goods so cheaply, in part because it pays its employees so little.
They also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of automatic cars or manual scanners.
Black Friday protesters demanded a pay rise and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the companies had risen sharply from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart employee gets $9.5 an hour, but that's not the same as the cost, employees say.
Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, prove that if Walmart raises the average wage to $12 an hour, it will cost the company $3.2 billion a year.
That's on average 1.1% more than this company is spending on salaries now.
If Walmart puts the pay rise entirely on the shoulders of consumers, every single visit to the store will only cost 46 cents more.
In a year, customers will spend about $12.39 more than they do today.
Walmart's lawyers point out that the protest was only in nine countries and should not have caused virtually any damage to the company.
The "Black Friday" in the company's stores lasted from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day, and during that time, Walmart sold about 5,000 items of merchandise per second.
In total, her treasury made nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
Dan Fogelman, a company representative, said in an interview with the left-wing website Huffington Post that a total of "less than five" Walmart employees had lost their jobs and that the protest was all "another media sensation" organized by the unions.
"The empty vault!"
Protests continued this week in New York City, where they were not targeting Walmart stores (those in the aforementioned progressive city are not very popular, and therefore are hardly here), but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he sells billions of servings, and then he doesn't even pay you sick leave and pay you properly for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage for work is $7.25 per hour, in accordance with federal law and New York State regulations.
Fast-food restaurants are gradually increasing that wage, but only slightly, and their regular New York employees are getting an average of $8.90 an hour.
Nobody gets a lower salary in this expensive town.
I don't quite understand how you can exist in New York for that kind of money.
McDonald's employs nearly a quarter of American teenagers who work behind the counter part-time after school and live with their parents.
Few people see it as their main source of livelihood or plan to stay there for long periods of time.
I'm constantly interviewing McDonald's employees who complain that they have to live off that money, and sometimes even feed their kids.
On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal has a commentary that the author notes is irresponsible to have children if you don't know how to feed them.
Protesters, who began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and chefs in fast food establishments start getting at least $15 an hour, more than double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade unions be established in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing the formation of trade unions and punishing trade union activists with harassment and dismissal.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes life easier for them.
However, introducing a trade union organisation in fast food businesses is difficult for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is the unusually high fluctuation in employees.
Disagreement
On this day, there were noisy protests at a number of other low-cost restaurants in Manhattan.
The event culminated in a midday rally at McDonald's near Times Square, where several local Democratic politicians, most notably City Councilman Jumaane Williams, spoke, saying, "McDonald says he sells billions of servings, and then he doesn't even pay you sick and doesn't pay you properly for your honest work!"
Demonstrators also received support from other prominent New York Democrats, such as mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must come together to support fast food workers so that they can get the fair pay for their work and the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!"
As the New York Times described it, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of the American fast food scene.
But only a few hundred people attended, although not all of them were fast food workers employing tens of thousands in New York City.
Whether this event will become a spark that will ignite the flames of the mass movement remains unclear.
"So far, the brain is able to lie on average".
Among fans of modern virtual reality technology, augmented reality is a popular theme; lately, it has been seen as a way of seeing the world, especially through the lens of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer, Google presented a working model of this innovation at its annual conference and in November it was announced that Microsoft had also applied for the patent.
In an interview with Microsoft's head of interactive 3D technology at Cambridge Labs, Sharam Izadim, it appears that for the company's scientists, glasses are a thing of the past.
The trick is the perspective of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands, creating virtual public spaces.
- Can you tell us in a framework what your research team is doing?
- We're dealing with human-machine interactions, but at the same time we're trying to push the boundaries of that interaction.
So far, humanity has been stuck in the process of working with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes touching the screen with a finger.
We want to look five to 10 years ahead and predict significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensor -- that's a step forward, and almost no Xbox is for sale today without the Kinect sensors, because for everyone, it's a very interesting gesture control option.
- What's in the future?
- Despite the Kinect system bringing interaction to the physical level, very much interaction still takes place on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input information stream has improved (the system receives more data), but the output stream has not been particularly good so far.
We're trying to change that, working on really three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projective imaging.
We need to bring the computer world into our physical world, make it more real.
However, to do this, it is necessary to know not only the user but also the space around him.
Then we can add virtual objects to the real world in a much more appropriate form.
And first of all, to hell with those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of voice control?
It's a popular thing, but isn't it overrated?
- Of course, he can't be considered a villain - the privacy issue arises because we don't always want to inform others in our community about our activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of computer interaction are good, but in their own environment.
For example, we had a project to control devices in public places where we thought about gestures, but not over-the-top, just the expensive, short ones.
The gesture would not be captured by a camera device, but by a bracelet that would monitor the movements of bones and muscles.
It's big, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But in general, the future has a mixed control type, like gesture + voice.
- How did you do that?
How do you ask me to give you this can of lemonade?
You say it and you show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, that's going to be very hard to tell.
So you want to get users to adapt to what the machine can or can't do at the moment?
- It's not necessary, but it's a rapprochement.
I think in the near future we'll have to work primarily on developing new types of sensors that can more accurately detect human reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors that provide fairly good depth resolution, which is very important.
- Speaking of your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Isn't there enough discernment, depth, or something else today?
- Basically, the current generation - that's what we can shake off in our work on 3D recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1,000 f/s.
But it's not just the megapixels themselves, but the matrix and the depth.
At the moment, all the current technology is not enough for us -- that adds to the work of algorithm designers.
So we have to keep in mind not only the resolution of the X and Y axes, but also the Z.
So what's really important is the speed, the number of images per second.
Human movement is quite dynamic, and the current data flows of 30 frames per second are, frankly, a little bit small, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes of our Redmond lab has made a touch sensor with a set processing delay of 1 to 100 ms, whereas the current, mass-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands the extent to which this affects human-machine interaction.
I would find the equivalent of this kind of device very useful for my job, just I don't need that much touch, but I need some extra footage per second.
- And the camera increase is not necessary?
- Three 'cameras' are now used in the Kinect system, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other a reflected signal receiver.
And the third camera -- this is actually a regular visible-band sensor.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A larger number of cameras could potentially solve the problem ...
Or make it worse because it would increase the required volume of computations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analogue system called Kinect, play around with the curvature of the camera's positioning and see how it helps you determine the three-dimensional position.
- As I recall, Microsoft (unlike Google) did not present its glasses to the public.
Don't you think that when it comes to the everyday use of augmented reality technology with special glasses, it's one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking around with your smartphone in your hands is not very comfortable, but I think the most powerful option would be a "portable" form of augmented reality, where you could switch from glasses to smartphones, projection displays, and so on, at any time, based on a cloud platform.
Glasses -- this is a very personal device, and that's their strength (only you can see private things), and at the same time their weakness -- augmented reality based on glasses won't let you work on virtual objects at the same time as other people.
- Imagine for a moment that manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in Iron Man, but to an ordinary mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point to: there is no tangible response!
My hands can't feel anything!
What are your group's responses to this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh successive breakthrough in human-machine interaction.
I think the addition of tangible perceptions could easily be the eighth breakthrough.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is using the second hand as a kind of visual substrate.
He's recording the pressure in a great way!
But there are also technologies that really aim to add tangibleness to these "air images" -- for example, interfering with several directional ultrasound beams at a defined point where the finger is located, it creates a tangible feeling, but it's still very weak -- like blowing your fingers in the belly.
There is also a wrist bracelet that affects the nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool your brain?
To think he feels what he seems to feel at the moment when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried that yet.
Here's another challenge that will be fought for a long time - how to get a person who is physically in a very tight space to believe that he's walking through an open, virtually infinite space - we're also working on the concept of running tracks (not at all like clubs), moving platforms and also huge balls.
If brain-deception becomes a target, then work is still for many years.
That's what makes virtual reality work so appealing to researchers -- a lot of things are in the very beginning.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is a continuation of the project "Petrograd avant-garde", dedicated to citizens who are at the forefront, the avant-garde of culture and art.
The top of the list already included prominent figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements extend beyond the city, often gaining recognition in Europe without achieving all-Russian fame.
The new hero of "Rosbalto" is the stunning artist Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller -- a bearded man who wears all red, who you meet here at the Russian Museum, here at the Summer Garden, here at the fashion boutiques and at the tanneries.
The paintings of Cyril Miller, wherever they are displayed, always attract crowds of viewers.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical St. Petersburg storytellers, creators of new mythologies.
Cyril Miller - this is a remarkable man of the Petersburg avant-garde of the late '80s and early '90s.
Besides being a city man, his appearance on the streets brings a smile to the citizens' faces, raises everyone's mood.
He recently took up bottles and became a St. Petersburg bottler, as he matured into this complex role with his entire bohemian life, philosophy and image.
Cyril, why are you walking around the city all red and not yellow or turquoise?
I chose red as a designer of appearance and image.
In this world, red represents a compromise between the artist, the imager and the public.
Although, in general, anything that differs slightly from gray will arouse aggression and arouse bad qualities.
But my provocations are aimed at making conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is primarily an invitation to discussion.
And when did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At the exhibition at the Nevskiy House of Culture, where my work was exhibited.
I've figured out my path.
It was the time when the wave of old, unofficial, free artists passed, and the new, free artists I couldn't understand.
I made friends with new wave artists, post-Gazone artists, who brought us to the Pushkin 10 and the other wave wasn't.
It draws me to theater, to dressing, to music, to all genres except words.
And all this was coming together in your art clinic... it was important to me to be in the center of St. Petersburg culture, where all the best forces of creativity would gather.
In 1995, I took a position at the Pushkin 10, and there was a music-art club, a bohemian club, the home of the Petersburg bohemians, before the reconstruction.
There were many born there: NOM, Tequila Jazz, remember how they brought the String with the project "Van Gogh's Ear".
The string and his friends sang under the cover of light songs, dressed in the appropriate t-shirts, in the middle of them composer Igor Widow, who is now in fashion.
When the band started playing live, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg has led many programs of Hali-Galician times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, that started his great career, he got his basic education and training from us.
Gallery "D 137", Griboyedov Club - this is the sound of the Art Clinic.
This is where our workers and our regulars left.
I'm the hero of the last century, when culture was still important.
In 2000, a survey was organized, it was in the press, the special prize was "People in our town".
I was nominated for Artist of the Year, ending my career.
In the new times, according to the old rules, work is unpleasant, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
It's easy to be popular these days, but culture and popularity are different things today, you can be popular, but not too cultural.
Your work is characteristic in a recognizable way.
- Many of my paintings are hits that capture the moment and penetration alive.
I'm going to have a program exhibition called "The Russian Museum in Clowns".
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be social, but now being social is painful and terrible.
But in clowns, everything is erased, tragedy is filmed.
I like grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, saving the world through a totalitarian disguise in a dictatorial order.
People today meet by clothing, oriented to the outside mechanics, not the inside man.
Or maybe you can't reach out and spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed by a change of clothes.
- We saw you as the city bottler recently. - A culture city should have a hero like that.
And who else is he if not me?
- And commercial art can be beautiful?
- Nowadays, commercial, useful art should be thorough, tactful, sweet.
There is a decay of cultures.
In the past, people would gather in noises, and the goddess loved one, ordinary other people.
Today, everything has broken down in micro-companies, today, it's very difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you like.
Today, every cultural hero has 100 fans.
And there's a few thousand people coming to St. Michael's!
- He's got fans coming to him, the sex-social sphere getting involved.
And 300 people come to the cultural ground and 10,000 don't come, and the result is less management, less money, everything is ruined.
I have fans, the important thing is that no one deceives them and doesn't violate what's been experienced.
When I was young, I painted pictures that were hanging on a wall in a collector's house with Falk and Larion.
I started with the pictures that people usually end up with.
People often misunderstand things today.
They say, "Culture is spiritual, culture is consumer.
There's no consumer culture, it's from somewhere else.
I'm a man of yesterday's culture, I grew up on the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money to paint.
And I'm for that culture.
Cyril, what is missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There's a concept called a cultural agent.
But not everyone can deal with culture.
In the time of the real Tsars, it wasn't always like that, the Tsars may not have understood the culture very well, but they understood that they needed to support real experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they're stuck in a corner, because we need great experts who will evaluate these experts correctly and guide them on the right path.
Today, taste is thriving.
The same Erart, but they're different because they honestly say that we don't accept all modern art, there are artists who should look elsewhere.
- What do you think of St. Petersburg?
- Petersburg - it's not the capital of culture, Moscow has a lot more culture, there's the right soil.
And art is doing poorly on our corner.
We need cultural land, but we have more writers than readers today, which is bad.
There are a lot of curious people in Europe who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have a weak layer.
We need art to become a fashion issue, like it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented with the support of the St. Petersburg grant
Born in the universe
The country is in danger.
Global warming or a collision with a deadly asteroid.
Spacecraft caravans with Earthmen on board are set to travel, looking for a replacement planet.
To save humanity, the key question arises: How do we keep our race in a weightless condition or on a given alternate planet?
I don't think the choice is big.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be conquered, even if only hypothetically.
"It is Venus and Mars", says Vladimir Surdin, a senior scientist at the P. K. Sternberg State Astronomical Institute (SAIS).
But while life is better on Mars, temperatures on Venus are as high as 500 degrees Celsius.
It's only possible to live there at high altitudes or in orbit of Venus... in space.
Scientists have started to solve the problems of reproduction in the universe with the flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were conducted on plants.
Four generations of orbiting toys are no different from their Earthly relatives.
Then the insect was carried into orbit - a very small fruit fly called Drosophila.
In 1979, a partridge egg was sent into space to test the development of the embryo in a weightless state.
We get a perfectly normal cock at the exit.
But then the problems start.
"The problem is that this bird has to find a support, stand on its own feet and start moving", says RAN Biomedical Problems Institute (IBMP) laboratory director Vladimir Sychev.
If they don't find a support, the birds will fall chaosily and make their nests.
After 10 hours, the newly hatched birds had a complete loss of instincts.
The birds didn't respond to light or sound.
And the problem was, they just died within four days.
"We let the birds bite twice, but then we refused because it's simply impossible to work with them there", comments the failed experiment with chickens in space Vladimir Sychev.
The last "miniarche" of animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
But in Bion, there will be only one-sex beings.
An experiment was conducted on rats that were already pregnant when they were being broadcast into space.
They didn't find anything supernatural there.
"It was only on biosatellites, but again - this is a unique experiment and such experiments need to be conducted", says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing on Earth, the space rats had offspring.
However, we have not yet been able to approach the problem of reproduction directly in space.
It's a tough job.
Animals, when they lose their normal environment, simply cannot exercise their sexual instincts.
Man, unlike animals, can in principle.
Homo sapiens rules abstract thought and is capable of creating an appropriate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, no such experiments are conducted.
But women have been flying in space for 50 years.
The greatest danger was the Tereshkovians.
The most precious thing mankind has is a woman's body.
Our tea has gone, and no one on Earth could tell if it could survive a flight into space.
I wonder if she can have a baby after a flight like this.
"No one has yet answered this question", says rocket and space industry veteran Vachtang Vacnnadze.
In June 1964, more than a year after a space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father was also an astronaut named Andriyyan Nikolaev.
In 1988, the son of the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savica, who visited orbit twice and also worked in open space, was born.
But the risk remains.
We have a few astronauts who are born after many years and have healthy offspring.
"In addition, it can be dangerous even in orbital flight", says astronaut-pilot, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
Yet, humanity must inevitably find new ways to biotechnology, radiation protection, and the creation of artificial gravity.
The CPK Hydro Lab is a mandatory flight preparation stage.
Here, in zero-attraction conditions, astronauts are developing the habits they need to work in open space.
Water mimics the state of weightlessness.
Although water is comfortable for adults, it's a strange environment, but it's a natural element for young children.
The tiny ichthyanders seem to confirm that life on earth originated in the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a baby is in the fetal water for an average of nine months and that it is easier for them to get used to the water.
It's logical, in principle, because only two weeks have passed since the moment of birth, the moment of the first ransom.
"It's very little to make a child forget", says newborn swimming instructor Marina Aksenov.
In short, if the weightlessness is more natural for a newborn baby, then for a woman, gravity is more natural, the force of attraction.
In a weightless state, abdominal muscles, pelvic floor muscles, and the body's ability to ejaculate decrease very quickly.
We can put that aside if the stimulators for muscle activity are working during labor.
After all, it is possible that the birth took place in a special chamber where the mother's body would expel the fetus.
"What next?" asks Valery Polyakov with difficult questions.
On the other hand, a baby needs artificial gravity, too.
If the body is not affected by gravity, it cannot properly shape the skeleton or muscle system.
A newborn in orbit cannot be dressed as an adult in a special suit with a weight to train in.
He'll just be stripped of what he needs unconditionally for his development.
"If we go with you to an experiment that allows a child to be born in an alien environment, we will bring a disabled person to Earth who will be completely unadapted to the local environment", predicts Igor Pestov, head of the IBMP RAN bioethics committee.
So the birth of children in the universe is just a theoretical question today.
But the time will come when it will become a reality and when the earthlings will sail in their ships to a distant planet that will become the home of their spaceship-born offspring.
Chief of the NCO: The control of the smuggling system failed because of politicians
The Czech Republic has good regulators and good quality legislation in the field of public procurement, but it is not very good at applying it.
In an interview with Aktuálně.cz, this is what the vice president of the Supreme Control Office, Miloslav Kala, says.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct - that is what I think we lack", comments Kala on the current situation.
Similar conclusions are also suggested by a joint audit by the Czech and German auditors.
As an example of wrong practice, Peter Neczas cites the approach to the so-called "scamming system".
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS will not bother the businessman with its controls - so is it prohibited or allowed?
"The law must be set up in some way, and if it prohibits something, then even the prime minister cannot prevent the work of the office that is obliged to check and enforce the duties", says Kala.
At the meeting of the House of Representatives' control committee, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, in which the legislation on public procurement in both countries was compared.
What was it, exactly?
It's a parallel check we started about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation regulates the way in which public procurement is handled, followed by individual national legislation and then by practice itself.
We have put all this together, and although the audit is not yet complete, we have found very interesting differences - in general, the legislation is perhaps "more rigorous and more perfect" here, but the practice itself is in some respects better in Germany.
It is therefore clear that it is not enough to create ever more precise rules, but that the application of the law itself needs to be addressed.
What good can this project do for you, what good does it do for you?
It is this kind of joint control that could help us to stop making efforts to clarify laws, reduce and improve limits when it has no such positive impact.
Economics means acquiring a good at a reasonable (but not always the lowest) price to avoid enrichment and, if necessary, criminal conduct.
But by lowering the order limit, we don't necessarily have to achieve that.
Perhaps the system will be so overwhelmed with paper that those who want to look for holes in the system will find it much easier to draw on than if the limit remained higher.
You're talking about the domestic problems with the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system in Germany work?
Is there a similar office to our NKU, or is it set up differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organized like us, also has a college, but it is a little different, but basically both authorities operate in a similar way.
The powers are also somewhat similar, but since Germany has a federal system, it also has these courts at the level of individual federal countries - in this the system differs slightly from ours.
The BRH can only control federal money, represented here by state funds.
The public funds that are administered by our counties and municipalities are controlled at the federal level.
As far as the legislation there goes, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare this without specific data, however in some respects Germany is often referred to as a model, but it cannot be said with certainty that it is better at everything.
So, is it necessary that they have better controllers?
I'm sure not, but I'm saying again, I don't like that comparison.
But it has to be said that even the countries we consider to be the model face a number of problems.
Otherwise, there's no benefit to them from working with our office, right?
As for the domestic legislation, which meant for your office that the amendment to the Public Procurement Act was in effect, are its effects already being felt?
Since the validity period of this notice is relatively short, it has not yet been reflected in the control measures.
Since we're doing ex post checks, we need to expect some delay.
We are only seeing this so far in the process of preparing future checks - we have launched our new tool for "risk detection of insolvency", through which we have passed and analysed almost 14,000 public procurements - and those changes will of course be reflected there, because the limits will change, the conditions of some types of tender will be adjusted and so on.
So, do you consider the passage of this law a benefit or a further burden on the bureaucratic system?
I think this bill is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope it's confirmed.
The problem here is that the rules will become "strict" and it won't be possible to follow them.
Already during the previous rules, the controlled persons are obliged by the provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes by the regional council) to consider that any non-compliance with the public procurement law constitutes a violation of the budgetary penalty.
Is it worth it to tighten the law in this way?
I don't think this way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and exploit it, not punish those who make a formal mistake that has no impact on decision making.
Such a system will only put more pressure on the bureaucracy.
So how do you get out of it?
Let's see where the road leads.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the SDGs would not bother businessmen with the controls of the so-called "switching system" - and what does that mean?
Is the punching system prohibited or allowed?
The law must be set up in some way, and if it prohibits something, the Prime Minister cannot prevent the work of an authority that is obliged to check and enforce its duties.
He can say, "We'll change the law and allow it", but he can't say we'll act like nothing.
The Public Procurement Act has quite strict rules on what is to be done formally - which is right to protect public competition.
But on the other hand, it's tragic when the candidate with the best bid is excluded for formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - that is what I think we lack.
The roads are frozen, mostly but sloping
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and snowed.
But most of the time, the highways are sloping, with some extra care.
The district of Karlovar
In Karlovy Vary, the roads were slippery this morning, places frozen and snowed.
The temperature has dropped between five and 10 degrees below zero, but it is expected to warm up slightly during the day.
The snow in the region has stopped and there are only weak layers in the lowlands.
But on the crest of the Crush Mountains, there are about 30 centimeters of snow.
The seats were also less visible due to fog, according to the district road traffic controller's data.
The R6 motorway and first class communications are now off-limits in the region.
However, caution is exercised, for example, in certain areas where the surface may be frozen and slippery.
All second and third class roads, including mountain roads, are also open to traffic.
But there are still fragments of ice and snow on them.
Particular attention should be paid to driving in higher positions.
Pardubić and the King's Palace district
Some roads in the eastern Czech Republic are threatened by frost, and snow can be found on highways and mountains, the Directorate of Roads and Highways reports on its website.
Motorists warn drivers of frost, which can form especially in higher places in the Pardubican region.
The ice may be found around Lanškruna, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitáv or Vysoký Mýt, especially on second and third class roads.
Chemically treated roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitav.
Snow is especially common on the roads in the Krkonoše and Orly Mountains.
The snow cap is at the highest positions on the roads in the districts of Rychnov above Kněžna and Trutnov.
In eastern Czechia today, it is mostly clear until it is clear without rain.
Temperatures usually range from minus three to plus one degree Celsius, with a weak wind blowing.
The area of Spinach
The roads in the Plzeň region are clear this morning, but places with increased caution and driving must be adjusted to the weather.
It's freezing in the morning, temperatures range from three to nine degrees below freezing.
After the previous snow and subsequent cooling, some communications may be frozen.
The driver will have to count the seats with the fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
That's from the county road traffic controller's information.
The D5 highway is almost unrestricted, but traffic controllers recommend increased caution between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most first-class roads have dry and frozen surfaces.
But in the south of Plzeň and Tachovsk there may be frozen sections.
Class 2 and Class 3 communications are wet and in this case also a warning for frozen sections applies.
Drivers should be especially careful on less frequented roads in the Shumava area.
Olomouc Region
Today, snow on the road is a must for drivers heading to the highest points of Olomouc County.
After the chemical analysis, she stayed on the Red Mountain Shipyard and on her way to the Vigil.
The snow drove the motorists out into the field on the night, and the road authorities said about three centimeters of snow fell on the town of Schumpers.
In other parts of the country, the roads are mostly off-road without restrictions.
"On the highest points of the Sumatra lies the remnant of snow.
With snow on the Red Mountain ridge, drivers must count towards Jeseník", said today the dispatcher of the road administration.
Their colleagues at Jesenick also went out into the field at night, and they say the roads to the highest points are now bare and wet after chemical treatment.
On Olomouc, the roads are unrestricted, but in Sternberg, drivers should be careful in the forested areas where the roads remain wet.
The Bay Area, the Liberian Region
A few difficult landing sites are reported by a motorist in the north of the Czech Republic this morning.
In addition to a few snow-covered or icy areas, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice on Ústeck is also closed, according to the police database.
Temperatures are also below zero in the lower regions, so ice and snow are likely to persist on the roads. In the lowlands, especially southeast of the Czech Central Mountains, there are no problems and roads are usually dry.
Operational complications have not been reported.
The glacier is reported by motorists, especially from around Štěti.
Meteorologists say the conditions were ideal at night - during the rainy day and the snow, clear and freezing at night.
The main reasons for the adverse conditions are also reported on the I/13 road on the border between Ustiska and Liberec region.
The closure from the Telnice to the Princes was forced by the bent branches of trees that bended to the side of the road under the snow.
Shimon Ornest: We want to build positive energy at concerts
What do you think about the world ending in less than a month?
It's just one of the other scary news stories we humans like to catch.
We're making a joke out of this, and we're saying that we're the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
And in December, you're going to have a very unique project of three concerts towards the end of the world.
Can you introduce him to your readers?
This is a national charity event we've been planning for two years.
We've decided to tap into the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced on December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
On the day before 20 December, from 9 p.m. there will be three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end around the time that the Mayan calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is 12 hours ahead of us.
Who came up with this idea?
It was probably my idea at first, but then we invented it with our artist, Honza Augusta.
In addition to gathering enough positive energy to prevent the end of the world, we also want to work with the public to think about how we will one day pass on this world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we also created a unique collection of shoes, t-shirts, bags or original keys to the end of the world that people can also support by purchasing at www.e-tap.cz.
The Tap Tap, along with other performers, also sang a so-called anthem against the end of the world called "The End of the World Is Over".
She's already a big fan of YouTube today, so she's gonna play at these benefit concerts?
Of course, and that's in the end, if we can do everything and the world doesn't end...
It's sung by all three performers at the same time.
The songs will also be united in a unique live broadcast on Czech TV.
He wrote the lyrics to this song and the main role of Jesus in the video is played by Tomáš Hanák, also singing in it Xindl X...
How did you get to work with them?
We also work with other figures of the Czech cultural scene, as we organize a lot of charity events and concerts...
We're trying to get them involved in these projects.
Turns out most of them are interested in working with us and have fun.
What's the profit from the end of the world concerts?
To equip the Studeo Barrierless Education Center, which we have been implementing for the sixth year with the Tap Civic Association in Jedlička Institute.
The students of Jedličko's Institute are regularly visited by lecturers and engaged in activities that they enjoy and care about.
The students themselves don't have the means to be lecturers themselves, so we try to make it possible for them to do so.
As part of the delivery of the Jedličko Institute, a separate building will be built in the future, which we will move into with this project.
There will be several bands and performers at each concert.
What did you pick them for?
We've been trying to put together a program that will reach all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bart, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will perform.
You can find out all the details at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any similar "bombing" actions in the future?
We're going to perform for the first time in Prague Spring in May, so we're definitely going to have an interesting program with interesting guests here.
Next year we'd like to play at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, once we're in the States, I'd like to tie it to a show in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimalist, you've already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these routes logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it looks at first glance.
We have five members in an electric wheelchair, their wheelchairs must travel in the luggage compartment, and we also, of course, carry a large amount of cargo and a toolbox...
However, so far it has always been smooth, and the Czech Republic and British Airways have been so well prepared for us, I was amazed at how many times.
Even in Moscow, from which we recently returned, it was without problems.
Excursions abroad can help you compare how different people are in terms of unbarriers, public access to the disabled, and so on.
What have you met so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than ours, we have seen in Russia that everything in the East is still in its infancy.
Moscow is very barrier-like to Prague, and it is still unusual for an electric wheelchair user to travel alone in the city centre.
There's no such thing as a self-evident proposition, like you prefer the wheelchair.
Fortunately, civil society organizations are already emerging there to raise awareness of the problems of people with disabilities.
And what, on the contrary, is there still to catch up with the more advanced countries?
There's a lot of things we're still behind...
But it's important to note that improving and improving a situation always depends on the efforts of the people involved.
In London and Madrid, it's quite common for people with severe disabilities to walk in public on their own, to go to the bathroom, to the museum, anywhere...
But it's not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to be actively involved in social life, and we're a little ahead of The Tap Tap!
Respecting the public or being barrier-free is one thing, but only when we become great athletes, artists, actors, politicians, or lawyers, will things really start to change.
So far, they're the rare cases of people with strong will.
The Tap Tap is a very popular band today, but let's go back a few years, what made you start it in 1998?
I joined the nursery as a tutor, where I had many young people who were interested in doing something.
And as a musician myself, I play saxophone among other things, so I and a colleague started an interest music group.
And over time, as our host Lada Angelovic says, it got a little out of hand. (Laughter)
But popularity only came in recent years, am I wrong?
True, it helped us to start connecting with well-known singers and also to actively promote the band.
We found that work that is invisible is essentially as if it doesn't exist.
In addition, thanks to contributions from the European Union, we can afford quality lecturers, equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to get The Tap Tap this high?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something different.
Show business is full of stuff where one person imitates another.
It's logical, in a way, anything new is taken carefully and takes a long time.
Things that are unique are very few, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is, of course, regret, it's natural...
But that pity is completely useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering from all the abandoned beings that we have to pity.
They are people who can live a full life and thrive, provided, of course, they have the means to do so.
I'm saying that if people with disabilities make a difference, it's not just a shift for them, it's a shift for the whole society.
Did you also contribute to this success by being a strict boss, as many people have called you?
To do good work, we must be uncompromising in many ways and require discipline.
But I think that's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and their heads in the clouds, and when they find that they have to go to rehearsal twice a week, get ready, and spend a lot of time traveling to concerts, their excitement quickly goes away.
But that's how it works everywhere, in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.
How many of them were at its inception in 1998?
Only the one Angelovich Tray.
We're an open group, people come and go, it can't be stopped.
Whoever has the will and the will always has the door open
It will take place the day before the world's end, Thursday, December 20, 2012 at 9 p.m.
The event will take place in Prague in the Incheba arena, Brno Fledé and Ostrava Plynoj, with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
The three cities will be telecasted together at the end of the evening to sing the song "The Tap Tap"
The aim of the concert is to raise funds for the equipment of the multifunctional barrier-free education centre STUDEO at Jedlička Institute in Prague in the amount of 25 million CZK
Admission to the concert is $400, children under 12 have free tickets at the Bohemiaticket pre-sale
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at a meeting of the European Space Agency's Ministers of State, Poland was admitted as the 20th member of the European Space Agency, the second country from the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland began working closely with ESA in 1994 and has been involved in a number of ESA projects over the years.
But Poland's journey into space began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already engaged in spaceflight before World War II; but they did not always meet with understanding.
For example, I recall A. Sternfeld's lecture at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, which on December 6, 1933, presented ideas from his pioneering work Introduction to Cosmonautics.
The ideas of the young engineer (November 1905) left the audience cold, and after years, Šternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934 he was awarded the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize for his contribution to cosmonautics in France.
The noted Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899-1966) later became a great proponent of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-renowned promoter of cosmonautics, and his contribution was recognized by the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the Moon was named after him.
In 1925, a railway line was built in Poland to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is unknown and the details of the project are not known.
It's also unclear whether the missile was intended to launch the tractor or to stop it.
Information about this drainage is known only from the periodical.
Since 1933, the Polish artillery has been surrounded by missiles.
The research was carried out by the Armed Forces Technical Unit in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolf and Prof. Gustav Mokrzyckieg.
It is clear from the preserved materials that the research has reached the stage of practical testing.
However, the arrival of German troops interrupted the research.
In 1937 a design of a photoelectric fighter missile was published in a professional press, designed by engineer Rohoziński, and the following year the work of the Raket - air torpedo and airship rocket bomb by Leliwy-Krzywoblockki was published.
Both projects were intended for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was devoted to all projects of military missile technology, which coordinated all the work.
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of activity, its activities ended with the start of the war.
Further works on cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Astronaut Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The first mention of the company was in the November 1954 issue of the journal Problemy, which included four more comprehensive articles on astronauts.
One of them, by Professor M. Subotowicz, proposes to create a society that deals with cosmonautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects were already underway, and it was clear that space exploration was a promising field.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) has been seeking membership in the International Astronautical Federation (founded 1951) and already in the autumn PTA became a full member.
And the following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959) became the vice president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has been significantly involved in the development of the highly successful RM (Meteorological Rocket) which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first RM-1 was completed in 1957 and first launched on 10 October 1958.
The 1,800-meter-long missile was about 80 centimeters long and weighed less than 5 kilograms.
Later, an improved version of the RM-1A was built and in the summer of 1959 two-stage RM-2 missile flight tests were started in the Bledovsk Desert.
The missile was 1.4 meters long and weighed about 11.5 kilograms.
Another development type was already capable of real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket was to have a range of up to 14.5 km and its task was to track high winds.
However, in 1962 further development was halted.
The successor to the first RM-type rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965.
The missile was designed as a two-stage, with a total length of 510 cm and a launch weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (designated Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, varying in size from space to space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a capacity of 0.4 litres, the Meteor-1B 0.34 litres and the Meteor-1C 0.62 litres.
Maximum range for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Institute of Aviation, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had a launch weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg to an altitude of about 60 km.
Subsequently, versions of Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also worth mentioning that Poland joined COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of the COSPAR National Committee two years later.
Poland also participated in the Interkosmos program in space research on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remk.
Repeal the Public Works Act is not the answer.
Last week, the Constitutional Court struck down the Public Works Act.
The resolution has sparked a lively public debate.
It will certainly be interesting to look at the issue in a broader light.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of more, unregulated competition.
In effect, this means that individual economic sectors, national economic systems, are in permanent conflict with each other.
The reason is the principle of free trade and free, unrestricted movement of private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.
The effect of the considerable differences in labour prices (wages) is price tension.
By this term, it is necessary to understand the situation where a producer tries to remain competitive by importing cheap goods by 'stimulating' the price of a competitor in order to gain a greater market share and thus increase its profits.
On a mass scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either moving production abroad, or buying cheaply there, or disappearing. The result is high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it produces, the social expenditure of the State necessarily increases.
The whole situation is reinforced by the unwillingness of the entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thereby compensate for the economic and social damage they have caused to society in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that no specific statistics need to be provided.
The negligent practices of private capital create a situation in individual economies where governments of individual countries are forced to enter into competition with the aim of artificially lowering the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments are giving private capital the benefit of their own people regardless of social decline.
This is mainly reflected in the amendments to the laws in force.
The aim is to force the own population to adopt the price dictate of private capital, particularly in the wage field.
This is done, first, by the system of economic coercion in the case of longterm unemployment and, second, by restricting workers' rights in the field of labour law.
The result is growing poverty, coupled with the growing gap between rich and poor.
In the SRN, public food spending has been in place for many years for the poor who cannot support themselves by working.
The number of these people is already in the millions.
As part of the increasing competitiveness of the German economy, it is quite common for properly employed people to receive such wages that they have to be supplemented by the existing minimum.
This scandal has been made public even in the case of the deputy staff of the Federal Parliament.
The negative measures taken by virtually all southern EU countries are undoubtedly leading to the same situation, where people are forced under the pressure of a catastrophic decline in social levels to either emigrate as they did in the 19th century or live for starving wages on the margins of society in the hope that some day private investment capital will come to the country.
But here we have to ask, where does it come from?
If it's from other EU countries, then poverty moves from one country to another, or it doesn't come at all, because Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian, or African still work for a fraction of European wages.
That's all about Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media are stunned to the point that the state cannot participate capitalist in its own economy, that a controlled economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital firmly insists that the State must not interfere with the economy by managing its intervention.
Then the question is whether private capital does not influence, in fact, now govern politics and thus the whole state in its own selfish sense.
Here's the obvious answer: yes.
The evidence is the existence of a practically omnipotent and ubiquitous lobby in every state.
The result is a desperate situation manifesting itself in the areas of corruption, mutual benefit, legislation, where practically everything is punishable but nothing is criminal.
In the SRN, the situation is such that, due to lack of funding, the State Ministries have entrusted the drafting of the laws to private law firms that are closely linked to industry.
These bills are then approved in the Bundestag.
All power thus comes not from the people as Western-style constitutions claim, but from financially powerful groups that prefer their own interests.
Clearly, liberal democracies are now rapidly coming to terms with what Appianus describes in his Crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesar and Pompey: "The state has long been in complete disarray and the authorities have been occupied by violence.
For bribery, for obtaining favors illegally, and for using stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished without any restrictions and the people went to the elections with a pre-sold vote" ..."characteristic people did not run for office at all, so once as a result of this coup was to be without consuls for eight months".. .."It really began to talk about the only cure in a bad situation is self-government and that it is necessary to choose an energetic man.." Appianus was thinking of Pompey, but he became Caesar, who changed democracy permanently to self-government.
Conclusion As in antiquity, modern society is based on a reckless preference for self-interest, regardless of the interests of society as a whole.
Private capital is no longer capable of understanding and applying the benefits of society at large.
The result is now, as then, an unprecedented decadence of elites without any attempt at deeper reform.
The causal of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the reckless liberalization of economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
The current state of affairs is that the demise of these systems in favour of liberal democracy can be seen as a break with the expectation of a new round.
Particularly disastrous is the fact that the current elites are completely ignoring the potential hundreds of thousands of lives lost in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters we are already witnessing, along with the crimes against humanity as we know them from the old and the new histories.
Repeal the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least not permanent.
Under the pressure of competition at both international and intra-European levels, the Czech Government will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is to pursue political and social reforms that will strengthen the state's participation in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens on government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favour of the state.
Israel: The lab of chaos.
"Nothing comes of violence, and never can", Sting says in the song Fragile, whose chorus is "Let's not forget how fragile we are".
"If my sons had not wanted war, there would have been none" dying Gutten Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild in 1849.
After the latest wave of violence between Israel and Gaza, as always, there has been a lot of reaction.
Some are for Israel, arguing for its right to self-defense and Palestinians fit into the role of terrorists, others are supporting Palestinians, arguing for the racism of the Israeli state, genocide of Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel fit into the role of a terrorist state.
I don't want to think about who is responsible for the recurring waves of killing and who is the victim, after all, the people of Israel today, including the self-governing territories, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the onset of violence.
I'm trying to give readers a behind-the-scenes look at who has been served by the 95-year-old tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in a small part of the Middle East.
Some of my reasoning is supported by available historical facts, some of which are derived from my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of events in modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily the history of the struggle for power.
In every era, we can track down some of those Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individuals have always been completely autonomous in their own ways, or whether someone has been behind their throne to direct their actions toward a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we live in a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that comes from it could not have happened in a single generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one who could be considered the head of an octopus (if anyone still stands above them I don't know, but I don't rule that out) - the Rothschilds.
There's not much to say about them.
Of course you do.
The first news agency (Reuters) was bought back in the 1990s to stop associating their name with the highly criminal acts they were involved in, which for them always meant consolidating power, increasing wealth, or both.
They have major stakes in almost all the world's central banks and against countries where central bank shares are not in or preparing for war (before the invasion of Afghanistan, it was 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq, it was 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi, only four remained, but in the meantime Russia has subordinated the central bank to the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to restore the Rothschild Bank of America's central bank status, began issuing his own (understand government) money during the Civil War, and was assassinated in 1865 in a theater.
JFK started issuing his own money and wanted to abolish the Fed, was assassinated in 1963, and Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he tried to sue the Fed for starting the Great Depression in 1929.
Their desire for global power led in 1859-1871 to the formulation of a plan for the three world wars by the composer of the highest, 33rd degree, dedicated by Albert Peake.
The first war was to eliminate the great monarchist states of Europe, the second was to eliminate the colonial dominions, particularly Britain, and the third was to reduce the world population to somewhere between 0.5 and 1 billion people (this number of slaves is enough for their comfort and luxury and they do not consume so many resources), create a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing but a prelude to such a solution) and ultimately take over absolute power.
The method that a group of the richest families, led by the Rothschilds, are working on is to create a crisis and then offer a solution (order ab chao).
However, these solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the establishment of the Fed to avoid a recurrence of crises like the one they caused in 1907).
So after they succeeded in killing the Habsburg successor to the throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo to start World War I, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by starting the Bolshevik Revolution.
World War I ended abruptly, militarily and economically unjustified, with the surrender of Germany (no longer needed war to destroy Tsarist Russia) and the subsequent fragmentation of the Central European power, Austria-Hungary.
To facilitate the outbreak of World War II, the policy bankers let themselves create a latent conflict situation by imposing huge war reparations on Germany, thus creating the premise of the radicalization of the impoverished masses, and then they simply pointed the finger at the Germans for a sufficiently strong, characteristic and simple solution offered by the leader and further by creating a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority who played, and also played, the fifth column function, when the fire was lit.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds encouraged the establishment of the Zionist movement, one of which sought to establish a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration, as already mentioned, created the conditions for mass Jewish immigration to Palestine, and the first clashes with the local Arab population began.
There have been terrorist attacks on both sides.
World War II broke out, whether Hitler broke off the chain of the international bankers, or whether everything he did was planned to be difficult to predict, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps, however, set the stage for the acceptance of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as war reparations to Germany were paid for during World War II, the declaration of the State of Israel created the focus of the Third World War.
If the international bankers manage to spread it, the Jewish nation, like the other, will be the victim of the front line of fighting, now along with the Arab or Muslim population in the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of friction and chaos not only domestically but also internationally (just consider how sharply people divide into pro-Israel and anti-Israel).
Who is to blame and who is to blame in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where injustice breeds injustice in an endless chain of violence, when at the beginning of it all was the greed of individuals and their desire for global power?
Here, it is necessary to distinguish the ordinary citizens of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers insist on people choosing their own candidates in elections.
The current Israeli Prime Minister, Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist, international bankers loyalist politician who is doing everything to start a war with Iran that, given Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could escalate into a global conflict and threaten to destroy the world economy given Iran's control of the Strait of Hormuz, which ships 20% of the world's oil (the shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide)
In what light are now the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "All we need is a general crisis and people will agree to the new world order".
The new world order in their minds is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves the comforts of a handful of financial aristocrats.
A world where every newborn individual is implanted at birth with a chip that makes him a totally controlled being.
"He makes all, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, wear a helmet on their right hand or forehead, so that they cannot buy or sell unless they have the mark, the name of the beast or the number of its name.
It's important to understand: whoever has the sense to count the numbers of the beast.
That number represents a person, and that number is six hundred and sixty-six".
Argo: When it's worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of demonstrating Islamist students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
The release was to be in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, who fled to the United States after the revolution, which had been the patron of his regime for decades.
It did not offer a positive outcome for the US administration - it could not afford to throw the chessboard overboard because it would fundamentally jeopardize the confidence of allies in other countries.
But the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of theocratic rule, was not able to be achieved.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later compounded by the failure of the hostage-free attempt.
The diplomats were finally released after 444 days of detention, after negotiations mediated by the Algerian government.
Their fate at home has sparked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment.
Debakl in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's defeat of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
A film directed by Ben Affleck Argo depicts an episode of the story that brought America a minor victory.
Six employees fled the embassy just before it was occupied.
After a complicated period, they ended up at the Canadian ambassador's residence.
The CIA, working with Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, while helping with an extravagant cover story -- they went to Canadian passports as members of a film crew who were watching the location of a big sci-fi movie in the country.
Mixed genres
The plan devised by exfiltration expert Tony Mendez also required Hollywood's cooperation.
To make the legend credible, the film project was featured in specialized magazines, press conferences were held, the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation have been kept secret for a long time, and the film is based on Tony Mendez's memoirs.
Affleck's film is a strange combination of multiple genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller, also called a "caper movie", a story of a successful piece, betrayal - an example of this could be Danny's series of partners.
The film thus alternates in mood - on the one hand documentary sequences from Tehran (the title sequence shows iconic contemporary photographs of events and the way the same situations were depicted in the film - no big differences).
On the other hand, light-hearted Hollywood passages, reconciled with irony and a slight exaggeration.
And then there's scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions of men in suits discussing the situation at the negotiating tables, in the halls of the office, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has been remarkably successful in re-launching his career.
From a mocked actor to a respected director, his acting has ceased to be the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film, following the dark crime Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller City (2010).
It's also the first Affleck film not to take place in the director's home town of Boston.
The atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that the director's older films elevated above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck is also showing it in Argu, where Tehran is playing Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place on the streets, recreating real events - the opening sequence of the embassy's fall is impressive in its overview, which at the same time conveys the emotion of confusion and unpredictability that comes with a clear history moving somewhere.
Affleck and his associates have a similar effect in fictional scenes (a fake staff at a Tehran bazaar).
Too many things happening in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story told does not actually offer much in the sense of film-like thrilling scenes.
He's working on it pretty well, sometimes thinking of reality - it doesn't go down that elegantly (a scene where the looming crisis at Tehran airport turns off the phone in America and the runway chase seems pretty drawn to the hair).
But Arga's weakness is the dispersion that comes from having to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in the roles of Hollywood collaborators, but their characters deserve more space and are far from the only ones in the film.
Affleck's film is losing some dramatic momentum, a film that can be watched with a slight interest, appreciated for its realization and retro style evoking the thrillers of the 1970s.
It's just hard to pull.
As a reminder of some sort of living history and proof of how exaggerated the notions of the omnipotent and omniscient secret service are, but enough.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankovnipoints.com, which annually publishes the most absurd bank fee poll, has now decided to announce a contest for "the most absurd regulation or ideas from the EU workshop".
"We have been led to the latest event, when the EU plans to adopt a 40% quota for women to lead major European companies", said Patrik Nacher, the survey organizer at Pravu.
Among the absurdities mentioned is the recent decision of the European Court of Justice on the unification of insurance rates for men and women.
Until now, women have been given a premium in life insurance prices because they are objectively less risky for insurers.
"More incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The vote itself will then be held until the end of February 2013", Nacher said.
Controversial EU regulations include mandatory mixing of bio-components with fuels, which is harmful to nature, a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers simply because they contain relatively small amounts of a dangerous substance, or a chicken cage size directive that significantly retarded eggs this year.
Criticism has also previously been met with the fact that the use of the term "ointment butter" or the exclusion of traditional bulbs from sale was effectively prohibited.
The quality bananas should be 14 centimeters long
The EU apparatus often decides under pressure from the commercial or industrial lobby, whose demands in Brussels are usually defended by a state or group of states (the Czech Republic now enforces its bank demands even by threatening to veto).
The lobby's interests also included the requirement that, for example, the highest quality bananas in the Union should be at least 14 cm long and not be 'anomalously curved'.
The European Commission has defended itself by only harmonizing the previously unconventional national standards that have complicated trade.
The EU has already relaxed the rules on fruit and vegetables, despite opposition from some countries, pointing out that existing directives lead to food waste.
Last year's EU regulation, which requires that inflatable balloons sold must be warned that children under the age of 8 must not inflate without adult supervision, could also be a candidate for the survey.
The EU has cited a US study that shows balloons between toys are the leading cause of death by suffocation in children.
A similar restriction now applies to children under 14 when blowing in holiday bags.
Curious ideas are born at home.
The rule for European officials is also quite absurd - anyone holding an official position in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the issue to Greece and must speak instead of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Banking Service.com, in cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists Laissez Faire, has also nominated the EU food supply regulation in the territory of a Member State for the survey, in addition to some of the above absurdities.
The EU has set maximum food stocks that could be in the Czech Republic on the day we joined the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the prescribed quantities of canned mushrooms, for which it was subject to a high penalty.
The survey organizers also liked the idea of paying some countries for not having a sea, and the idea of granting grants to the grant application.
But these ideas did not originate in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We are handicapped by the lack of a sea.
We are asking the European Union for a refund,' said the then Minister of Agriculture, Jaroslav Palas (CSSD), in the autumn of 2004.
He argued that we had produced a lot of grain and that the so-called intervention purchases would have meant that the warehouses he had to export were full.
For having the Czech Republic farther to the ports, the EU was supposed to pay us hundreds of millions of euros, according to Palace.
The European Commission finally met the Czech Republic by organising a tender to buy grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant was offered to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development, headed by Minister Paul German (US-DEU), and was to be used to write the application for a grant from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are an exception
While regulations in the Member States are easily the target of criticism, EU efforts to regulate and at the same time to improve the functioning and development of the Union as a whole are more deserving of recognition, according to many experts.
The most serious problem, according to experts, is for example the drawing of EU grants for projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration but which have been forced by Member States during budgetary negotiations.
The Czech Republic is also excited by the fact that, like other EU countries, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to specific labelling of its traditional products, which is not always a win-win situation.
Although the Czechs claimed the name Olomouc rum after six years of fighting with the Germans and Austrians, the indigenous rum, whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, had to be renamed Olomouc rum by our producers.
Rum designations may only be made of cane distillate, not sugar beet.
The official list of EU registered products already includes world-famous feta and gorgonzola cheeses, marzipan from Lübeck, Germany and parma ham, such as carlovare dryers, coal and cloves capers and barley wine.
The EU trade mark can also be seen in the Pardubicus and the Gryphon tube.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how does one think he's running for president?
I don't care about being a senator or president.
If it worked out in our country without problems, I wouldn't be running anywhere.
But I can't stand to watch the last 20 years of the country stealing, thieves running around, people raising taxes and retirement age.
I didn't have the ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I'm 40 and an independent nonpartisan, I have no choice but to influence things than to run for senator or president.
You got into the Senate, but you soon left for the Castle.
You're not turning your back on the people who elected you?
I've been saying all along that I'm going to fight for the Castle based on the Senate election.
Later, I made it clear that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not function, function is the tool to make my vision come true.
That's why I need the greatest influence and the strongest mandate.
The problem is not only that we as a nation are cursing in pubs and on TV, but that we are trampling anyone who wants to try to change.
And then there's the media, which dishonors people and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
I've been accused of paying reporters or being a counselor to George W. Bush.
Let's get to your vision.
You have entered the castle with the thesis of material and criminal liability of politicians and restitution of over 20 million.
You're gonna have to change the law to do that.
But as president, you have no such authority, and only the Senate as a whole can draft laws.
How do you want to solve this?
When I was a citizen, I lobbied for a free-for-all to be a guide, and it was enforced.
The problem is politicization - when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or the right, they deliberately reject it, and that's holding the citizens back.
As an independent non-partisan, I have much greater potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.
My preference is that without party boxing and dogma, I can take what's best for our country from every side and apply it.
Do you consider yourself more of a right-wing or a left-wing person?
From a Czech perspective, I think people tend to turn me more to the left.
It doesn't matter to me if it's a little left or a little right.
It's important to me that we move forward.
I don't care if anyone's left or right, but I want to connect people.
I will always support any publicly good solution, even if it is proposed by the CCP or the ODS, and I will still be against bad thinking.
You're fucking mad when someone says you're a populist.
But you don't prove it by what you said?
When you're building a business plan in a company, you also have some ideal goal and vision.
And you're trying to get close to that.
Some might call it populism, but all the ideas I'm talking about are already working in the world, or they've been talked about by leading experts.
But without parliamentary support, you'll only have passwords.
And you won't get enough of that in politics for long.
Or do you think that by going out and talking to people, you can impose criminal and material liability, for example?
I don't have a choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them to join us in pushing it.
If I were elected president, it would be okay to have a live television broadcast where I would ask the presidents of the parliamentary parties to establish material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And they might have to tell me why they don't want it.
If there's a strong personality who names the ugly, you can push the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president, it was due to public pressure.
I'm an amateur, I'm not a genius, I'm not an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my views and visions.
I'm just getting started in politics, and I'm gonna try to get a majority for my program.
I'm trying to move things on my own, if it doesn't work out, I'm out of it in six years and back in the private sector.
It sounds a little like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I'm not gonna do anything in one person, so I've been running around a lot of famous people trying to see if they'd run for the Senate, too.
I went to Radim Janchur, who refused because of the workload.
At least I supported investigative journalist Jan Lorenz who exposed light-heat oil scams.
I ran for president saying people are really unhappy, but now I'm on the edge.
Sixty percent of the people did not go to the polls, and those who did did mostly chose the establishment's representatives.
We're the only two independents in the Senate.
The people have framed the Senate so that changes will be difficult to enforce.
I'm still going to fight for my vision, like direct election of mayors or heightmen.
You're considering starting your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to check the clean history of every potential client, and I don't have the money to do that.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign, I only have $20,000 in my bill.
Don't you have any money?
You're talking about property claims, what's yours?
Private property is estimated at about 60 million.
I have a property in Prague for about 25 million, an apartment for 10 million, another apartment for eight million, a collection of artwork for about 10 million, an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Superb Scratch for a million, and then I have a couple of million in my account.
I have the Aston Martin, by the way, because it was my boyhood dream - I always liked James Bond, who rode in the car, was gallant with women, and at the same time fought against evil and ugliness.
You drive an Aston Martin, you have $60 million in assets, and you don't have campaign money?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don't want to put your own money into it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
You want me to borrow that?
I've already put $2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors indicates that I don't think my program is interested in that much.
And I'm not obligated to pay for the campaign on my own.
The campaign costs will basically cover what I'm getting for my senator salary.
But I wouldn't survive it, for example, I couldn't afford my son's English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I'm just trying to make money, I'm not running.
So you're going to keep doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you were going to suppress these activities?
But it's not about the salary.
As I promised, I've partially suppressed my activities.
For example, a travel agent will become my deputy in the spring.
People would want me to be the Samaritan who will save the republic.
But I need something to live on, too.
How much did you get used to taking a month as a businessman?
Two hundred to four hundred thousand, which I'll take on.
And if I were president, I'd be out of business.

MVRDV architects are proof that real adventures are not just in the head - for example, Spijkenisse and the recently built Mountain of Books - 2 pictures
"The building looks cheerful, futuristic, and finally there's something interesting to see again", says Lisette Verhaig, walking along the side of the road.
Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a nearby large company, says, "Of course, the house is nice".
But I wonder what we still need a library for today.
They all have the Internet, iPads and e-books.
No one goes to any of these old-fashioned libraries voluntarily anymore, right?
Spijkenisse, a neighborhood near Rotterdam with no job opportunities of its own, and not worth visiting, holds a special record.
This community of 80,000 people has the lowest level of education in the whole of the Netherlands.
To resolve this stupid situation, a decision was made a few years ago to contribute to general education and build seven beautifully painted, reinforced concrete miniatures of fictional bridges depicted on euro banknotes.
But the success of the education offensive was not a complete failure.
And so the city council realized that there was only one way to become a statistical master: we had to have a library!
Winy Maas of Rotterdam's MVRDV architectural studio, master of wildly bold column graphs and maker of funny, often even cynical buildings, accepted the matter with the usual calmness and appeared at a competition in 2003 with five books under his arms and a slap on his face.
And while the committee was still looking around in awe and shrugging its shoulders, the arrogant Maas put his gifts on himself according to size and ended his activist-based speech with the words "Dear City Council!"
So this is my proposal for the Book Mountain in Spijkenisse, called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain was erected at a cost of 30 million euros.
It is part of a revitalization project that also includes an underground parking lot, a supermarket, a post office and several adjacent residential and row houses totaling 50 apartments.
In early November, the Mountain of Books was awarded second place in the "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
A small-town street that has so far been unable to offer more than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an unusually ugly town hall whose white facade you'd expect a dairy would make it a little richer in contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has its first public cultural building in its history.
A long way to the book
First impression: a reading room under a cheese cover.
While there is an elevator that goes through the mountain, the true spatial and reader's passion is only discovered when you walk through the topography.
The glass interior is bright and clear from all sides, the burnt-out brick floor and elegant streetlights clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You see the park benches, the dog and the boys and girls playing football.
And all the books, books, books.
"Normally, bookshops are located along the facade, and in the middle is a large dark space that is usually unobtrusive and impersonal", says Winy Maas.
We built a classic spatial configuration upside down and we pushed the space for the readers from the inside out.
The interior of the Book Mountain is cleverly used: the centre houses offices, an online library, a chess club, an ecological centre and a home technology centre.
A special delight is the black bookshelves, which are once a wall covering, once a parapet, and once a stairway.
The appearance, structure, and smell all affect the skin.
Even sworn architects and civil engineers are turning their heads on unknown building materials.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials here", says Joop Trouborst, project manager at the Spijkenisse Municipality, in an interview with Standard magazine.
And so we came across a suitable agricultural waste product one day at a cool farm.
For many years, millimetre roundabout synthetic material has been used as a rootstock in glass and fields in the Netherlands.
It's cheap and time-efficient.
Thin textiles last one or two seasons and then mature to be dumped in bulky waste.
For the library, the runo - the first in such a large number - was played on a four-centimeter-thick sheet.
By applying heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (LPG) is dyed into a dark, homogeneous, heavy material that smells a bit like a new car and a bit like a sports shoe.
105 steps to the top.
At the end of a nearly 500-meter-long tour, you will be rewarded at the literary cafe not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and figs in floral bouquets.
They care about the atmosphere, but most importantly, the proper humidity of the air in the literature mountains.
Gifts for the New Soul
"You might not believe it, but this house is, despite its many glass surfaces, an ecological demonstration project", says Trouborst.
It's heating and cooling with the earth's heat.
Although the Book Mountain stands under a glass lid, the sun shines only briefly inside, even on sunny days.
The wide, glued wooden bars, which are perpendicular to the glazed facade, serve as shade and capture much of the sun's rays.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest of them will be fully automated.
Stefan Spermon, an early sceptic in the IT industry, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verhaig has been there before.
And also the teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, who Boekenberg even refers to as Spijkenisse's "long-awaited soul".
The reason: a few weeks ago, every city resident was invited to the opening to donate one book from their personal fund.
The first optical gaps were to be filled in a yet unfinished library, which currently holds 70,000.
The concept proved to be true.
The shelves are full.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library", says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that our invitation has given every resident a certain connection to their new home.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
Even if it was just for decoration.
The MVRDV thus became involved in the royal discipline, which in professional jargon is called identity formation.
Spijkenisse wrote the history of literature.
No matter how young and uneducated he is.
That's the starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a bigger role"
Germany abstained from voting on the decision to accept Palestine.
According to US-European relations expert Stephen Szaboa, Berlin is thus on the brink of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: Germany first signaled earlier this week that it would vote against the proposal for Palestinian observer status in the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained from voting.
Why? Why?
Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis were doing in Gaza.
But now Germany must be cautious because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think it's going to support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical of Israel.
In March 2011, Germany abstained from voting on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
NATO finally took over.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on major international issues?
Yes, it is.
The reason is that it is changing its foreign policy, from a policy that was so to speak US-led, to a German foreign policy.
The situation is made even more difficult by the lack of coherent and uniform policies among Europeans.
The Germans are between two fronts.
They're expected to play a more independent role, but they're not used to it.
I think they're just settling into their roles, but they're on their way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
To foreign policy, like they have in France or the UK.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean from a German perspective?
It shows a willingness to take positions that are independent of the positions of the US or European partners in the case of national interests.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, that is, exports and its relations with certain areas, like Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests differ to some extent from those of other powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did economic interests influence the Middle East stance and the UN vote?
First, Germany has a large supply chain in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
So he must be careful not to scare the public, but also the elites in the Arab countries.
That's part of it anyway.
I don't want to give it too much weight, it's not a one-sided relationship.
However, it plays a significant role in the German considerations.
Did Germany's relations with the United States suffer when Germany abstained on both important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I think there is a great deal of understanding in Europe and even in the United States of America for the German position.
That's why I don't think it was as dramatic a break as the Libyan issue.
I hope that Germany will even earn some respect.
This is a sign that he must be considered an international player and his interests must be taken into account.
There are different views in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, on the other hand, has clearly vetoed the resolution.
Are there differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of American domestic policy.
I think the Obama administration probably has a deep understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation there, he cannot, of course, hold this position publicly.
I think the differences in opinion are not as great as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not very enthusiastic about Netanyahu's politics at all.
Is it not difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand and with the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes it harder for the Germans.
It would be a little easier for the Germans, of course, if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is not happening at the moment.
So they can't be part of a wider line and they have to move things forward from their own position.
That's what they're doing with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take the lead in the future and push Europe towards a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, of course, given the relationship with Israel.
It's always been a sensitive subject.
But I think the Germans know they have to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as a major international player?
Or is the leadership role still difficult for Germany?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still uncomfortable, and for obvious reasons it is still difficult for this country to play a bigger role.
If we look at the European crisis, for example, every time Germany takes a bigger role, anti-German sentiment arises.
It doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
It's actually an old problem: we don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this respect, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It has to be acceptable to all kinds of neighbors and opinions, and it's not easy.
The US' influence in European politics is now declining, but the EU is not currently filling that vacuum.
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, they're uncomfortable with it, and it makes them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Brand protection" in China: when Puma and Armani are Chinese at the same time
Armani is a world-renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren is too.
What is Armani Polo?
This is a trade mark which is fully registered in China but has nothing to do with the original company.
However, they enjoy protection as long as they are not claimed by the actual trademark owners.
And even then, it's not clear whether the law will be enforced.
"It's getting harder for foreigners to protect their brands in China", says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, a firm specializing in copyright infringement in the Far East.
Every week, a new case lands on my desk.
The forgers need a few more letters to sign up for their trademarks.
For example, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada, they register Prada-Kny.
This way German companies, such as Puma sportswear manufacturers, are also legally copied.
Pattloch opens a schedule with the trademark office records in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company had its Zegna DF Puma trademark protected, an artificial name that is also parasitic on the Ermenegildo Zegna fashion house.
It is well known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and infringing intellectual property.
In large cities, there are several apartment buildings selling almost exclusively counterfeits.
But Pattloch's case is different, and he's proceeding to authorise his agents to prevent Chinese companies from being granted a trademark license by the Trademark Office that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", an associate brand.
This word is for "Bang Dakuan".
That's what women mean when they hunt rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"It's hurting the business, we have to clean it up", Pattloch challenges.
"The signal is dissolving, the exclusive position is disappearing, image damage is huge".
The financial losses and legal costs of the affected industries are in the millions, especially for the expensive sampled products.
According to CLSA, China is the third largest and fastest growing market for luxury goods with a volume of EUR 15 billion per year.
However, erasing dubious records in the trade mark register can be difficult and costly.
The trial may be extended for up to nine years, with uncertain outcome.
Pattloch recounts cases in which the court rejected lawsuits because the name had become a "market reality" after a long period of time.
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he still has to pay the plagiarist because he damaged his brand in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules.
The known cases also relate to graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction machinery manufacturer Sanna, a company that had recently taken over the German pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That's why the Chinese are still allowed to use an emblem that looks like a Mercedes star.
Geely, which bought Volvo, originally used a blue-and-white logo that resembled BMW.
Fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore who turned the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The CTMO Trademark Office admits that there were shortcomings in 2010 due to too few staff and space.
But last year, it was reported that "the work process went back to normal from an emergency situation".
For example, the number of unprocessed complaints decreased by 22%.
57,000 of these cases have been closed, up 75 percent from the previous year.
Still, the office still has 81,500 complaints to settle.
It's expensive to do something about it.
As is often the case in China, these are impressive numbers.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1,4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
That's a record, and it means China is the seventh-ranked candidate in the world.
This also applies to the number of trademarks in force - a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1,8 billion yuan were collected from fees.
This means that on average, each application costs 1280 yuan, or 160 euros.
The dispute against this is worth several times, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
This group has been fighting the Chinese plagiarist for over seven years.
The Germans did manage to stop his illegal production of counterfeit automotive parts.
However, the counterfeiter continued to secure the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
We would forget about it ourselves, because in Germany surnames cannot be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO also rejected the Munich company's objection.
In two other instances, Freudenberg sought legal action, but the opponent in the dispute continues to fight to this day.
You have to be very careful.
Now the matter is before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler believes the case will lead to a good outcome and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "Driving is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time, money, and nerve".
The internal costs are not quantifiable, and they even had to look through a hundred-year-old file in the company's archive to present evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the counterparty a 'high six-figure amount in euros' in vain to settle the dispute.
"You can see what this means to us", says Wentzler.
The danger from the Far East is threatening to affect Europe as well.
And that's in case the impersonators get their trademarks out there.
For example, one Chinese manufacturer wanted to apply for the Freudenberg brand in Germany for shoes and leather.
This area of business has long since been abandoned, but it has managed to withdraw its registration.
"You have to be very careful", says Wentzler.
He and lawyer Pattloch are advising German businesses to be very careful when trading with China.
Rather, foreigners should "report anything that is in any way worthy of protection to China", says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it could be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg were to submit to the trademark in the final act of its play, then it would probably have to pay the license fees to the parties in its own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we'll be pushed out of the market in a contentious segment.
World AIDS Day: the beat, the singing, the helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir is rehearsing - and in Swaziland, orphans after parents who died of AIDS are delighted.
A story of connection that goes far beyond 8,733 kilometers.
First, there's the kick: cowboy high-heels, basketball shoes, women's boats, and men's moccasins look for the pace on the parcel and quickly find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then the voices of the singers - alt, bass, tenor and soprano - slowly pick up, pushing, and chasing each other.
29-year-old conductor Fiete Hopf almost lifts it out of his textile shoes as he combines his voices with his wildly drawn-out gestures.
It's Monday night, and the Imbong Choir is rehearsing a new song in the music hall of the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology.
There were 50 singers and singers between the ages of 23 and 69, from a human genetics researcher to a homemaker.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, each choral voice has a different lyrics and even more so in a very foreign language - Zulu, spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and parts of Swaziland.
Self-help
UNAids, the United Nations AIDS program, estimates that around 34 million people worldwide are infected with HIV.
Of these, 23.5 million live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland, there are 245,000 orphans after their parents who died of AIDS.
HIV positive is already more than 40 percent of the population.
For 180 orphans after their parents died of AIDS, Voices for Africa found patrons in the village of Estjeni, Germany.
70 of them go to secondary school.
You can take a monthly pension for 15 or 20 euros.
He guarantees the child a school uniform and a hot meal a day at Gogo Center.
In Zulu, the word imbongi means "story-teller" or "one who glorifies".
In a full Bantu language, no one can speak in this space, only sing.
For nearly a decade, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign soft language, sometimes bringing them back to where they originated: South Africa.
At an air distance of 8,733 kilometers from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is the village of Estjeni, which depends on the strength of the German congregation.
Forty percent are infected.
There are about 2,000 people living there, some still in plain clay or straw barrels, and most of them are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they have been exposed to HIV.
In Estonia, we see a small, ever-changing swath of the whole of Asia: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
Male circumcision, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, is not acceptable to the general population.
More than 40 percent of people in Swaziland carry the virus, which causes them to die at the age of 30.
The village was discovered by a group of people on their way to Africa in the spring of 2005, but most of all, the Imbongi people saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care but everything: food, clothing, education.
Without a high school diploma, they have no chance in a poor country.
At first, it was a private private effort by individuals that, for a few euros a year, could send a child to school and give him one hot meal a day.
But a year later, the Voice for Africa group was formed, and since then it has been caring for orphans and parents who have died of AIDS almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial SPIs include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Common viral infections are HIV, human papillomaviruses, genital herpes or hepatitis.
The rashes and itching are parasitic SPIs.
Who is the most affected?
Syphilis and seizures are most common in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five reported cases of syphilis in Germany are transmitted by male sexual contact.
In heterosexual adults, the common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungus), mumps and human papillomaviruses.
HIV is relatively uncommon among heterosexual adults in our country, but about 20 percent of new HIV infections are in this group.
Chlamydia infections are significantly more common among adolescents than in other populations.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people aged 15 to 25.
In addition, human papillomaviruses are common among adolescents.
How did the infection rate develop?
Not all STDs need to be reported.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of people infected with syphilis has more than doubled from 1697 in 2001 to 3698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2700 cases.
That's about a tenth less than a year ago.
What are the signs of a sexually transmitted disease?
Infectious diseases can cause genital ulcers, urinary difficulties, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and blisters or warts.
However, they often cause no pain or other symptoms and are therefore not noticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not offer 100% protection.
Because sexually transmitted diseases can be partially transmitted through infections of impurities and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially in the case of frequent intercourse.
If diagnosed early, most SPIs can be cured and later effects prevented.
Thanks to patronage, charitable gifts, and, last but not least, the fees the choir makes by singing throughout Germany, some money is raised.
"We have already sent about €200,000 to Estonia in total", says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
Money from Germany is managed in the village itself by Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman who can make herself known.
He also makes sure that orphaned children find shelter, for example, in one of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as the Zulu call old women, are the backbone of the village.
Some have taken 14 orphans, put a roof over their heads, and have the children arrive in school uniforms on time each day.
The children, who no longer have anyone, go to the shelter to Khanyisile, a lonely woman who is paid by the society as well as two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
Voices for Africa also founded a sewing school, built two chicken coops, and, together with the US health organization PSI, arranged for many people in the village to get tested for HIV.
It's not self-evident, and even though the disease is so obvious, everyone is silent about it.
A King with 14 Wives
"AIDS is absolutely taboo", says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality".
In fact, it's quite strange in a country where the king officially keeps 14 wives.
The last absolutist monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his restless lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, this state-approved lifestyle is responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
But also many migrant workers who spread the virus across the country.
Annette Lennartz says that while condoms are free on every corner, "no one uses them.
Culture is different - unprotected contact".
To encourage cultural exchange, the Imbongi Choir travels together every two or three years through South Africa, singing songs of grief, war, confidence and self-confidence of blacks, which many in the southern tip of the continent have known since apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing songs in black - such an award brings not only mood and joy but has already caused tears to flow from many wild border guards.
The road always leads to Estenia, where the singers visit children who are patronized.
Although this village is hardly found on maps, it is more than well known in the Ezuluna River Valley.
"Go to Estonia, there's light", people say.
And when you go back to Heidelberg, which is a 2,833-mile airline from here, to the smoking singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, you see that light shining here too.
NASA has discovered ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe found evidence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet could be up to 20 meters thick.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is the closest to the Sun, it also has frozen water, according to three studies published Thursday in the journal Science.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that an ice sheet exists in the region of this planet, which lies in a permanent shadow.
It's supposed to be at least 30 centimeters long and maybe even 20 meters high.
This water appears to have come from comets or even asteroids that hit Mercury.
But let's not give the ice a link to the existence of life on this planet, said the lead scientist working on the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help us to understand how water and other basic life elements reached other areas of the solar system.
Sondes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix, unobserved Earthlings, are taking part in exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to Earth, small windows to infinite farther.
The image comes from a photographic device developed by German scientists at the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets in our solar system, plus the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the International Astronomical Union's new 2006 definition.
This cut from the Spitzer Telescope's infrared image shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars, the oldest stars looking like blue dots, the most identifiable are the pink-colored "newborns" in the birth chambers of stars.
This region of star formation -- scientists unromantically call it W5 -- was discovered by the Spitzer Telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, 6,500 light-years away.
This variable heat of dying stars was captured by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The ring is made of material that the star exfoliated during the dying process.
In the giant Trifid nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, a new star is emerging from the gas and dust.
The photograph of the galactic "crab" was taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The Pleiades, also called the "Seven Sisters", is visible to the naked eye at night.
But the telescope makes the colors stand out.
The Helix Nebula may appear to the observer in this infrared image as a red eye.
It's 700 light-years away from the constellation Aquarius.
Its similarity to the Earth's continental shelf gave this nebula the name North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photography is the cause of an unusual coloration.
This "baby" among the stars was captured in full glory by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: how they came to be is one of the greatest astronomical mysteries.
It's probably the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest images of the Hubble telescope: a spiral galaxy
The images of spiral galaxies become true works of art in their colour.
The footage released by the European Southern Observatory shows a thousand light-years away Trifid nebula in the constellation Shooter.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (three-part, triangular), because the dark dust stripes divide the star-bearing heart of this star-bearing moth into three parts.
In the constellation Hadronosa, astronomers have photographed a foreshadowing of a space collision 400 million light-years from Earth, where the core of two merging galaxies collides with each other and must inevitably collide.
This star's birth was recorded by the Hubble Telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't like technical abbreviations, you can call it the South Wind.
The Hubble Space Telescope photograph shows a slice of the Iris nebula in the constellation Cefea.
This 1,400 light-years distant nebula is made up of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than normal domestic dust.
This image was compiled from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was recorded by the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
This larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
This stellar nebula contains the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The cluster of stars is creating new growths.
Also, this stellar cloud, associated with the Rosette Nebula, is giving birth to new young stars, 5,000 light-years away from Earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, just gas.
Scientists believe that it was formed shortly after the Big Bang, when the universe was largely hydrogen.
Our view of the universe: the most important telescopes
The telescope was supposedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, who used it to observe the stars a year later, before Galileo Galilei.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have been growing larger and deeper - and the views they convey are deeper and deeper.
The world's largest telescope was for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror in this picture was five meters in diameter.
The Large Binocular Telescope is in Arizona, USA.
It allows you to look into space using two mirrors, each measuring 8.4 meters in diameter.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands, La Palma, is huge, only the mirror measures 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Yet it is about 11 meters in diameter.
Disadvantage of cheap design: the telescope is hooked at an altitude angle, limiting its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at the high angle.
Its peculiarity is its high amplification of the light flux.
This, despite its relatively small diameter, is equivalent to the world's largest mirror telescopes.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, scientists search for signals from extraterrestrials in space.
This radio telescope is 305 meters in diameter.
Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) - searching for extraterrestrial intelligence - can be aided by any computer owner who provides its computing power.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
The Very Large Telescope is standing here, paying homage to its name.
This telescope with a total of four mirrors can illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at ESO's Chilean Observatory.
Its main mirror is expected to be 42 meters (42 feet) in height and is expected to be composed of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
But the pictures can be counted as early as 2018.
The two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were thought to be the largest in the world until 2007.
They offer two mirrors, each 10 meters in diameter.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which also uses the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes to view space.
A new giant telescope, with a 30-meter diameter mirror, is also to be built on Mauna Kea.
You can admire him in the picture here.
But the most important impressions from space are transmitted by the Hubble Space Telescope.
He's been providing us with remote worlds since April 24, 1990.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been tracking exoplanets - primarily those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 candidate planets had been detected since the launch of the mission.
The image documents the final preparations for the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space in early 2018 aboard the Ariane5 rocket.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope is 6.5 meters in diameter.
One of the telescope's tasks is to search for the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists assume that there is ice at the south pole of Mercury.
But there is no reliable data for that, because Messenger is orbiting this planet far closer to the North Pole.
Radar measurements have indicated ice on Mercury for decades.
Thanks to the Messenger probe, which was launched in 2004 and is the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now confident.
Drink butter every day and you'll live 168 years.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people live through the Bible age.
There's even a museum of longevity.
Looking for a trail in a country where 97 year olds are still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people live through the Bible age.
There's even a museum of longevity.
Looking for a trail in a country where 97 year olds are still relatively young.
I'm walking through the Talish mountains. We can call the wild romantic.
The microbus roars along a road with many turns along densely forested hills, ravine rivers, and simple rural buildings.
Everything is green and juicy, almost looks like we're in Schwarzwald.
But this is the southernmost part of Azerbaijan, just a few kilometers from the border with Iran.
The Caucasian ethnic group of the Talis are not well known, except that they speak Persian and Azerbaijani fluently and are very old.
The terminus is Lerik.
This little town boasts of a monumental Soviet-era architecture that doesn't fit in with the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe do not come here, and it is not easy to get here from Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan.
It takes eight hours to travel 323 kilometers, because the road is only one-way.
The fairy tale wealth that the country owes to the oil of the Caspian Sea has not yet reached the countryside.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik is capable of becoming a tourist attraction.
"Baku celebrated the Eurovision Song Contest in May - and we will be hosting the world's oldest people's festival next year", says Fatulayev.
She's the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
This is a documentary of the lives of nearly eight dozen Talishans from the area who are 100 years older.
That's my grandfather, he was 120.
At the age of 136, she gave birth to another child.
However, the controversial star of this museum is sheep herder Şirali Müslümov, who was said to be 168 years old.
There is no birth certificate.
And given that the oldest person with the papers was 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems highly questionable.
"He was born in the area in 1805 and died in 1973", explains Fatulayev.
This man was reportedly married three times and had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he was reported to have given birth to a daughter.
So, did not Şirali Müslümov, at his age, be wrong by a few decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of flying people in Central Asia.
"It seems that many elderly people live in parts of China, Japan, or the Hunza Valley of Pakistan", says Scholz, "and in Sardinia there are extremely many very old men".
However, due to the lack of evidence, no scientific evidence of age can be provided, especially when the matrix is missing.
A glass of dissolved butter every day
The fact is, people in the area around Lerik experience the Bible age remarkably often.
There are 20 people who are over 100 years old today.
So why are there so many elderly people living here in the South?
The Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this by using the special genes of the Talis.
The director of the museum, Fatulyev, believes that it's about nutrition.
However, the fact that the caloric diet of the Talis, who love meat, bread, and especially dairy products, many of whom drink a glass of dissolved butter daily, is so healthy does not seem to be a bromatological belief.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young?
At 97 years old, she's still relatively young at this latitude.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
He's sitting on the floor with a butterfly that he's always waving at.
Under one roof, eight people live here, including one of Mirzaeva's sons and daughter, both long-time grandparents.
Two little kids are jumping around.
In the kitchen, tea is made for guests, served in typical army-style stomach-shaped cups.
Mirzaev's white teeth form a perfect line and under the mantle is a long, dark blonde copy, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so it didn't look good and it kept the color.
"I've never used shampoo either", Mirzaev says.
A monthly pension is enough to live on
She always ate only what came from her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, games.
I've never bought groceries in my whole life.
Then he tells me about his husband, who was in the army.
The worst was during World War II.
But everything got better when the "beloved father" Geydar Aliyev took over the yacht.
Propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult that revolves around the figure of a father of nations who ruled his country as a dictator knows no bounds in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham took over the helm.
At least the elderly in Azerbaijan don't suffer from need.
Mirzajeva receives a monthly pension of 230 manat (about the same amount in euros), a sum that is a good living wage.
And perhaps Mirzaev's long-gray son is right: "Old people are very important in our culture".
They live in the midst of large families, loved, cared for, and happy.
If that's not a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The concept of "human rights" is missing from the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
The unbridled demonstrations in Cairo have revealed the deep division of the country.
There's a sharp debate about a future constitution based on Sharia law.
The Egyptian president didn't spare the pathogen.
We need to create a transition.
"And for us to succeed, I am responsible to people and to God", he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the entire nation, but primarily to Coptic Christians, liberals, enlightened Muslims, and secularists.
All those who have been so far hopelessly dispersed in the confused opposition are afraid.
Fear of the "God-state" on the Nile, given at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Morsi almost apologized for temporarily limiting the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court and expanding his own to "save the revolution".
But what a 61-year-old engineer with a doctorate from the University of Southern California really wants to save is not clear to the Egyptians or the world.
Is the judiciary to be stripped of power?
The 234 paragraphs that the Islamist-dominated Constituent Assembly hastened to pass in the 15-hour night marathon are partly troubling.
As in previous constitutions, this proposal says that jurisdiction is based on "principles of Islamic law".
But what do you mean, "principles"?
It was and is a matter of interpretation, and it is feared that Islamists will use this vague wording and the legal space associated with it to make Sharia more rigorous.
At least this is made clear by the newly added paragraph: In all matters relating to Sharia, consultation should be made with al-Azhar University, which is the most important Islamic institution in the country with a strong influence on all Sunni Islam.
It may not, but it may mean that the clergy will exercise oversight over the legislation, which would effectively remove the law from the judiciary.
There are many things to be interpreted in the draft Constitution
The problem is also that the civil jurisdiction of the military courts must continue to be maintained.
These courts were used under the Mubarak regime to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship, up to 11,000 civilians were held in military custody.
The proposal also states that the state should "protect the true essence of the Egyptian family and promote its morals and values".
This is so legally imprecise that it would allow the State institutions to even control the content of film art and literature.
In plain English, it means nothing but censorship.
Moreover, no paragraph in writing defines explicit equality between men and women.
The second paragraph prohibits the defamation or slander of the Prophet Muhammad and his envoys.
But it remains unclear what is to be humiliated and how to be persecuted.
The wording that "offending people" is forbidden is equally dubious.
In this case, is a caricature of the president or a joke enough to charge legal experts?
An interpretation, like many others in this proposal, which Morsi will put forward for signature and which he says will be presented to the Egyptians "very soon" for a popular vote.
"The revolution is back"
For several weeks now, opposition to the violence of Islamists has been forming.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual crowds on Friday night in Cairo's Tahrir Square, vowing to destroy the constitution before it goes into effect.
"The revolution is back and we will win", said Hamdin Sabbahhi, who came third in the presidential election.
Nobel laureate and former director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed Baradej, said the draft constitution was "a landfill of history".
Through a short-form Twitter service, he accused Morsi's followers of wanting to carry out a "coup against democracy".
"If he declares a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him", said opposition member Jásir Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet punished", Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Khalid Ali as saying.
Several judges have announced that they do not want to oversee the referendum, which would be invalidated.
"The Qur'an is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood has declared a protest, but not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile outside Cairo University.
It was attended by many veiled women and Salafist supporters who shouted: "The people demand the application of God's law".
They called upon Morsi, "Purify the land!" and they said, "The Qur'an is our law".
The struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic successor of Tahrir, from which it all began, would probably trigger a civil war-like state.
The Morsi supporters were obviously not willing to take the risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution spoke out loud and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people at the polls decide which way the country should go.
The majority is seen as certain in favor of the Islamist proposal.
"The word 'human rights' never occurs"
A forced constitutional dispute, which is supposed to continue until February and integrate all social forces, is roiling Hafiz Abu Sa'd.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended Muslim Brotherhood members when they were in prison or in court for Mubarak.
Not because he shares their ideology, but because he considers human rights indivisible.
He was beaten, convicted, and imprisoned for it.
"And in the new constitution now there is not a single word for 'human rights,'" he complained in an interview with "Welt am Sonntag".
Morsi's expansion of power to all three branches of government in the state has forced this lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandalous violation of the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president has effectively abolished it", Sa'da complains.
But without civil society organizations, democracy cannot function.
Sa'da feels abandoned by the international community, which is watching the struggle of ideological factions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
He could get away with it.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns, "You have created a monster that you can no longer control".
Norway lobster: The most stinking fish in the world?
Five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret to the country's success be linked to the local appetite for highly stinking fish?
Have some overripe cheeses.
Put them in the middle of a pile of dirty, wet soccer equipment.
Let it lie there for a week.
You'll get the paralyzing smell of the crabfish, one of Norway's greatest delicacies.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There's snow, beautiful views, and a pervasive smell in the air.
Rakfisk is a salted crust that is fermented in water for up to a year - depending on how much you want the fish to smell.
As it gets dark and cold, the Norse people begin to gather here in Fagernes for a festival dedicated to what they call the best, most seductive food.
"You eat it raw and then you drink it with a glass of aquavit", says Havard Halvarsen, a local firefighter, also known as "Rakfisk General", who is responsible for the festival.
People all around us eat small fish cubes and drink them with a lot of alcohol.
"Some people prefer aquavit to cancerfish", says Harvard.
The drink can smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If the fish can escape your nose, it's not that bad - it's like a slice of sushi that was on a long bus trip.
Rakfisk is a product of a very different era when Norway was poor, and because there were no refrigerators, fish were boiled in airtight water and salt tanks in the autumn.
Then in the middle of winter, when they were well fermented, they pulled out and ate - no doubt, their senses were numbed with alcohol.
Just one generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, mostly emigrating to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% of immigrants are attracted by high levels of work, high wages and a large care system.
The people of Sweden, an old rival that was much richer than Norway recently, are flocking to the country for work.
Cancerfish is seen as something important, indispensable, though a rather fragrant part of Norway's past.
It's one of the most expensive foods on the market.
Although everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you £9 ($14) a piece.
Norway is often not in the news - and most people seem to be comfortable with it.
The name Anders Breivik, a right-wing racist extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year, is still mentioned with disgust.
Instead, the shooting is called the "July 22 incident".
Norse people can hardly believe that in their peaceful country, one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
Norway's current wealth is the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries since the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason we're doing so well", says our waitress Anna, who with her long blonde hair and surprisingly blue eyes is a prototype of Nordic prosperity, serving plates with lying shellfish.
We are, as they say, considerate people.
Her English, like most people's English, is perfect.
We don't pretend, we don't like the looks.
Norway is very careful with its oil wealth - with the exception of a small percentage, most of the money from the sector is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When everyone else in the years leading up to the global financial collapse was throwing away money they didn't have, the Norwegians had their bags tightly tightened.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and go on trips in the summer, we're happy", says Anna.
"And eat the shellfish", he adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in line in the snow for something to eat - I've had enough of the fish.
I'm sure that's a different sort of burger, and it's pretty juicy.
But tonight, the smelly fish is back.
The hotel I live in is one of many places where you can serve fish for dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather the most expensive fish to smell.
They're connected to a live TV show where the host is a butterfly surrounded by a plate of crabfish.
It's like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What's your score for the best fish up in the mountains, Thore-Juergen?"
"This is our score, Howard".
There's applause and laughter.
A man will fall from his chair, perhaps possessed by aquavit.
Or maybe the fumes from all those fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto from Mexico has a tough start
As the incoming Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, Will Grant of the BBC looks at the challenges he faces and the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad these days.
In a city that is stuck in its prime, steel barriers have been erected to close several key routes to the capital and cause chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not to prevent the commuters from getting to work, but to prevent the protesters from accessing parliament.
On Saturday, the new President of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the Presidential Shroud and take over the leadership of the nation.
He's facing a tough task.
Mexico was doing well economically under the outgoing Felipe Calderón, but the country is on the brink of a drug war that has already claimed an estimated 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people in reducing violence", President Pena Nieto told US President Barack Obama at the Oval Office earlier this week.
I'm going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this goal.
Before shaking hands with the U.S. president, President Pena Nieto gained political experience as governor of his home state of Mexico.
Views of the new leader vary even in his old homeland, a populous and sprawling state surrounding the capital.
A straight man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo, he is remembered for good.
The citizens attribute it to the development of tourism in the resort and the construction of infrastructure.
You can now reach the city on one of the new highways that Pena Nieto built, which are a huge improvement over the crevices and bumpy roads that used to be here.
His name is also hung on the walls of a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We expect it to bring real and lasting change", says friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a state legislator for President Pena Nieto's party, the Party of Institutionalized Revolution (PRI).
We especially hope for the interesting and real changes in security and the economy that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was suppressed by Vincent Fox.
Senator Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the Los Pinos presidential palace, there is much to be expected from Enrico Pena Niet inside the party.
And he rejects opposition statements that characterise the new president as a man without substantive content.
He's a very straightforward man, very keen on a great vision of the land.
He's a great statesman and most of all, he's a good listener.
But on the other side of the state, this isn't the impression many people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo cannot be more evident.
Stuck under highway crossings in many ways resembles the suburbs of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the municipalities are also permanent and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called in to help crack down on the drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, particularly at the root of violence against women.
In the last two years alone, dozens of murdered women's bodies have been dumped in empty spaces next to huge garbage dumps.
During the time of Pena Nieto's governorship, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico, far more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
At best, Pena Niet's critics say he failed to adequately address the issue of women's murder in his time in office.
And in the worst case, his leadership accuses him of closing his eyes.
In a concrete house typical of a slum, Irine Buendia shows me pictures of her late daughter Mariana Luna and suppresses her tears.
According to the official story, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes her partner murdered her.
"When I arrived at her house, it looked like her body had been washed", recalls Mrs. Buendia.
There were marks on him after the beating and the postmortem stiffness was already beginning.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross with the only word on it: "Justice".
However, this is, as the family says, exactly what they were denied.
The authorities treated me like I was an old bitch, a troublemaker, a snitch.
They want you to just accept what they say and keep quiet.
"But it can't be right when there's been so many mistakes and neglect", he says.
The Sherpa that President Pena Nieto will receive on Saturday is accompanied by a great responsibility.
In the last six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been hit by violent crime, and the new president has promised to keep them a priority for as long as he is in office.
"I hope he will be the same president as the governor", says PRI MP Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But that's exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment, the military prosecutor says.
The military prosecutor is trying to disprove Bradley Manning's allegations of mistreatment in custody.
The hearing is focused on Manning's time in military custody in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case dismissed on the grounds of gross treatment of Manning in prison.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents.
A military prosecutor is trying to prove that Private Bradley Manning, who is charged with the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, missed many opportunities to complain about the harsh treatment he allegedly suffered in military custody.
Military prosecutor Ashden Fein, at the cross-examination of Private Manning at the preliminary hearing at Fort Maede, Maryland, claimed that records of Manning's weekly visits to unit officers during his nine months in custody at Quantic, Virginia, show no complaints of ill-treatment.
The cross-examination, which took place during the hearing of the defence's motion to dismiss the case against Manning for gross indecency in custody, which is itself a sufficient sentence, took place the day after Manning testified that he had contemplated suicide in custody.
An Army intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq.
The material was then posted online to WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
At Friday's hearing, military prosecutor Fein and Manning reviewed the forms that officers filled out after meeting Manning at the Quantic detention facility, where he was held under enhanced custody from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When asked by Fein on Friday about these forms, Manning admitted that he rated the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the overall treatment at the facility as "very professional".
The forms show no complaints of ill-treatment, although Manning's officers directly questioned how he was treated, Fein claimed.
Manning replied that he had expressed concerns about various problems orally and that the officers who visited him had spoken to him about these concerns and indicated that they would address them but did not report these problems.
"They wrote down 'no problems' (after discussing the concerns), and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't mention them", Manning said.
Judge Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment in January 2011 at a meeting with the Suicide Review Board, which he had expressed in a form several months earlier.
Manning replied that during this meeting it was his intention to achieve a reduction in the 'injury prevention' regime.
The military said that he used this restrictive regime (one degree below the suicide surveillance regime) to protect himself and the safety of others.
"I wanted the guards in custody to know that I was fine and that I wanted to cancel this injury prevention regime... so I could enjoy a higher quality of life, as I saw it", Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday of his arrest in Iraq and transportation to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transported to the detention facility at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he was considering suicide in Kuwait and one time he passed out because of the heat.
He said that not being allowed to know what would happen to him and what was happening in the world around him was very disappointing.
"My world has crumbled only to the base of Arifjan, to that cage", Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
Manning said that after arriving in Quantica, he spent most of the day (at least 21 hours, but often more than 23 hours) in a small cell with no company.
Manning said he was only allowed one mattress, blanket, diapers, some clothes and glasses.
He said he was trying to walk because sleeping or just lying down during the day was against the rules.
Manning said he always slept with the light from the outside of the cell in his eyes.
He said that if the guards could not see his face when he turned the other way at night, they woke him up and he had to turn back.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint about the treatment of Private Manning in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to a military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manning also questioned the charges he filed in Thursday's deposition, regarding the fact that after being forced to sleep one night naked in his Quantic cell, he was also forced to stand naked in front of a guard and other inmates during the morning count.
Manning confessed that he was not allowed to cover himself in his blanket when counting.
In Friday's interrogation, Judge Manning said that he had been instructed by his guards to postpone the cover he could cover himself with, but admitted that no one had given him the order to postpone it.
On Thursday, Manning confessed that he was forced to sleep naked the night before because he tried to show the officer that he wasn't dangerous.
Manning said he told the officer he could use his underwear belt or his nicknames to hurt himself, but he didn't.
Manning testified that his underwear, his lingerie and glasses were removed from his cell that night.
His lawyer hopes that the judge will take into account his experience during his imprisonment and that his sentence will be significantly reduced if he is convicted in a military court, which is expected to begin early next year.
The defense said it planned to have Manning plead guilty to lesser charges and that it would fight the other charges because they were too extreme.
The hearing is scheduled to begin this week, and the military prosecutor is expected to defend the terms of confinement as legitimate.
The Pentagon has issued a statement saying that Manning was being held in accordance with the regulations regarding all detainees held in maximum security custody.
The charges against Manning include aiding the enemy, illegally causing the publication of intelligence documents on the Internet, the transfer of information relating to national security, and theft of public property or records.
If he's charged with all charges, he could get a life sentence.
My crisis of Mexican-American identity
He says that many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities there.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind them of hard times, he says.
Navarrette says Mexican Americans are torn between two worlds.
On my last trip to Mexico City, I barely broke through the crowd and arrived at the immigration agenda area, where I ran into a problem.
The arrows pointed to one of two fronts: one for the "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans") and the other for the "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds and I didn't know where to go.
I grew up in central California and have been called "Mexican" my whole life.
It's an ethnic abbreviation, the same as when my friends in Boston call themselves "Irish" and my friends in New York call themselves "Italians".
So later I ended up calling myself "Mexican American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's homeland, there was no need to use shortcuts.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to handle both sides of the conversation in that language.
But I don't have a native speaker vocabulary, and I can't get rid of an American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and lined up for "Extranjeros".
I was thinking about the moment this week when newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama's White House.
They had the usual agenda that they discussed when the leaders of these two countries met: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of Mexico's economy, which is one reason why Mexicans are as likely to stay in Mexico as they are to travel to the United States.
It wants to join the United States and Canada and create a trade bloc in North America similar to the European Union.
And Pena Nieto has vowed to continue Mexico's war on drug cartels, although he has not provided any details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders under the threat of arms to transcribe half of Mexico's territory to the United States.
But for Mexicans who think in the range of centuries, not minutes, comments are ubiquitous.
So a minute after the US representative says something a little bit critical about Mexico, you'll hear in the Mexican press and among the elite complaining about how Americans interfere with their neighbor's sovereignty.
And the children of Montezuma will step on the warpath.
And yet, for Mexico, the real challenge is the relationship to the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about hostile feelings?
There's a lot of them.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people the country offers opportunities and others who don't.
The only reason so many people with Mexican roots live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio is that at some point in our family tree, there was a person, maybe a parent or grandparent, who was denied an opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than it seemed, this person matched the profile - dark skin, poor education, poor village background, etc.
We are their descendants and loyal to them.
Not against Mexico.
And even though we're living the American dream now, we're going to good schools and we're doing good work, we can never forget the fact that we're living the American dream, not the Mexican dream.
Our identity may be vague at times, but our loyalty is not.
It's against the United States.
And we're also aware that many of the elite Mexican ruling class don't like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and they see us as a inferior race that isn't Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
Our existence is, in their opinion, nothing but failure.
If our families in Mexico hadn't failed, they'd never have left.
And we would now find ourselves not trapped behind a silk curtain, with a good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came to the United States legally as a child, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans understand more about who they are, and Mexican Americans hate it.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she sees herself as part of two countries.
And at the same time, many Mexican Americans I know don't feel like they're part of any of it.
We love to hear Mexican bands, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both worlds, but you don't have roots in either.
In Mexico, they look at us like Americans.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexicans.
And to make the relationship even more complicated, some Mexican leaders and some of the intelligence, as I learned on my trip, want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as "provisional ambassadors" and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our American countrymen how great it is to visit this country, and push political leaders to strengthen relations with Mexico.
- I know.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And with income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are unsure that this is a great country.
I feel like it's up to you, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not willing to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel disgusted with the way their family members were treated in the substantially near future.
I'm not going to.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
The old battles, the new Middle East
The end of the Israeli-Hamas ceasefire could still be an uncertain basis for peace.
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The next round of bloodshed suggests that any such event is futile.
Among the usual unnecessary speculations about who started it, many buildings were turned into rubble, killing more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis, and the first rockets from Gaza hit near Tel Aviv, Israel's capital, and near the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though the Israelis and Palestinians seem to be stuck in their longstanding conflict, the Middle East is changing all around them.
The Arab Spring has changed the old order, and Palestinians and Israelis, like it or not, are caught up in the chaos that is coming in the region.
It may make their fight even bloodier than ever.
However, there are reasons to believe that this could disrupt their deadly patch situation.
A war that is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, there seems to be little reason for optimism at the present time.
Even if the ceasefire that was signed on November 21 lasted, this week's fighting has intensified the fallout on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to retreat even though Gaza suffered a defeat.
Despite killing several Hamas leaders and locking 1.7 million Gazans in one of the most deplorable and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
And indeed, Hamas is gaining influence in the West Bank, another piece of Palestine that is currently controlled by its rivals in Fatah, a more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas leaders can very well judge that time is on their side.
Islamists throughout the Arab world gained greater influence, so Hamas gained powerful and wealthy friends.
Turkey, a revived regional power that was once Israel's closest Muslim ally, has joined Hamas, as has Qatar, one of the Gulf's richest and most dynamic nations.
The Islamic crescent is surrounded by Israel, in northern Lebanon, where Hezbollah is ruling, through Syria, where rebels increasingly inclined to Islam can overthrow Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And most importantly, in the southern wing of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and dominant Arab country, has changed the balance in the region.
Husni Mubarak, a secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had no time for Hamas.
On the contrary, the Brotherhood is Hamas' cousin and its leaders are more influential in public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas may emerge as a player that neither Israel nor America can rule out.
On the contrary, Israel's hardliners will come to the opposite conclusion.
In military terminology, Hamas was put back in the box.
The Israeli Iron Dome missile system proved its worth and many of Hamas' missiles were destroyed.
The Israelis can sleep better - for a while.
In diplomatic terminology, America is as steadfast as ever, and many European countries have also blamed Hamas for the latest round of violence.
And most importantly, Israel prospered, especially under Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister who largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been relatively quiet from suicide bombers, partly because of the wall that strikes the West Bank, the main part of what may one day be a Palestinian state, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to grow despite their illegality under international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party joined an even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman at the start of the January 22 election campaign, is in a good position.
Why spoil the pro-Palestinian people by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled the West Bank, wouldn't they launch rockets like their countrymen did in Gaza?
We better hold them behind that wall and beat them when they get their heads out.
Maybe hardliners will win, but the Arab Spring could change their minds.
Although the Islamists, who are gaining power in Egypt and other countries, do not have much love for Israel, their top priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
Israel's defense spending is higher than all four of its Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a new war with a local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments recover their economies.
President Morsi's cooperation with President Barack Obama in achieving a ceasefire is a good sign and could mark the beginning of something new.
The Israelites too should look at the situation in the long run.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, denying Palestinians their right to self-determination creates a gunpowder vessel that must one day explode in Israeli-occupied areas - just like the bus that exploded last week in Tel Aviv.
Already today, repression is weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics are making this situation worse as the Arab population grows.
The bloody attacks against Gaza that take place every few years to suppress Hamas will increasingly draw on diplomatic taxation.
Both sides need outside incentives.
The answer is what the reasonable people on both sides are saying, most of the outside world and these papers: two states where Israel cedes territory for security reasons.
In the short term, there is some hope that the ceasefire will give outside pressure at least a little more leverage to push this issue forward.
Egypt, which, along with Turkey and Qatar, must work to stop arms supplies to Gaza, is in a better position than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders with a shared part of the country and a shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs from the outside must also push for a deal between Hamas and Fatah.
That would give the creation of a Palestinian state more than an immediate offer of virtual state sovereignty to the UN.
President Obama also has a role to play in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
In his first term, he neglected to present his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, he seems just as reluctant to step into the process.
That's pathetically shortsighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
It means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australia has enacted ugly cigarette packaging laws
The unsightly green boxes, which are the same for all tobacco brands, feature warnings for smokers and sick body parts.
Australia's first-of-its-kind tobacco and cigarette packaging laws came into effect, and brands' logos and colors were replaced by generic olive-green boxes with disgusting images of sick bodies and children and newborns who were sick from their parents' smoking.
In addition to the various health warnings and pictures, the only difference between the boxes of brand names printed in the same small letters is that they are mandatory from Saturday.
It is the strictest tobacco packaging regime in the world.
The Australian federal government claims that the goal is to discourage young people from smoking by eliminating the appeal of smoking.
It's based on studies that show that if people don't start smoking before age 26, there's a 99% chance they'll never start smoking.
"Even very young children can be seen to understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to sell them along with their product", says Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that, for example, have shown that children associate a logo crown with the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest rates of smoking in the world and the changes will have little impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are considering similar measures.
The tobacco industry has lobbied hard against these laws.
Tobacco companies claimed that the law would increase black-market trade, leading to cheaper and more affordable cigarettes.
"There are serious unintended consequences to this legislation", says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring in a lot more of these products to be sold on the streets of Australia.
Others say the laws have increased their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that demand for silicone cigarette packaging used to cover nasty cans had risen from near-zero sales two months ago when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their appeals over the laws to the Australian Supreme Court.
Ha stated that Zico had sold almost 6 000 units to wholesalers and expects new supplies.
It's a good deal for us.
As a possible barrier, experts cite the popularity of social media among the demographic targeted by the plan.
Following a series of Australian laws banning television advertising, sponsoring sporting events, and requiring most retailers to hide cigarettes from the public eye, tobacco marketing has moved online.
Australia has banned online advertising by local companies and websites, but cannot restrict foreign sites.
"If you're a marketing executive in the tobacco industry and you only have this little space left to promote your products, the online space is an unbeatable place to be", says Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Ms Freeman noted an increase in the ratings of brands on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, carried out by the "average Hunza".
We have to ask, is he just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and took the job and made this video, or is there a marketing company involved?
British American Tobacco Australia claims that the industry has focused on how to handle the new regulations rather than marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for the attack on the new regulations - countries within the World Trade Organization declare trade unfairly restricted, despite none of the countries doing significant trade with Australia.
The decision of the SOE is expected in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says the government has been in talks with other governments considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to introduce mandatory warning photographs in 2001.
They have now spread to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey, and Ukraine.
The United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Africa and India are considering stricter laws.
Many smokers in Australia resist.
The pictures have no effect on me.
I just ignore them.
"You just pull out a cigarette and stick the box back", says Victor El Hage, buying a box with a picture of the tumor in his mouth.
Honestly, there's only one reason I quit smoking, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, who owns the King of the Pack in downtown Sydney, claims that the single boxes make it harder for him to match them to the racks.
"It took me an hour to load, now it takes me four hours", Yu said.
"The government should just ban them completely, and then we'd say, 'OK, that's it, we're going to close the store,'" he said, and he decided with his hands.
In a world of constant connections, it's not so bad to be bored.
On the last day of Thanksgiving, I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport, when our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for the next plane to arrive.
So we had plenty of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Waiting half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite the distractions of books, magazines and iPhones.
But some child development scientists and experts are increasingly coming up with compliments about boredom.
They say it's good for us (and our children) to get bored sometimes.
It forces the brain to go in interesting directions, which can encourage creativity.
And since most of us are constantly connected to a screen these days, we don't have a chance to enjoy boredom.
So should we encourage boredom?
- I did.
And no, you can't.
But I'll get back to that.
First, like many people, I assumed that boredom was a relatively new phenomenon that came with the advent of more free time.
But as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, who is the author of the book Boredom: A Lively History, says.
"In fact, boredom has a long history", he said.
On the walls of Pompeii, a Latin inscription of boredom was found, dating back to the first century C.E.
And then there's the question of how we define boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After reviewing research literature and presenting ideas to a target group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of "wanting to do something that would satisfy me, but I couldn't".
Boredom is different from apathy in that a person is not involved in anything, but wants to be.
He says that there's no urge to do anything in apathy.
He says that the core of boredom is "the disruption of the attentional process associated with a bad mood and a feeling of slowly passing time".
Boredom can be a lot like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they may have a relationship, boring people tend to see the problem as the environment or the world, while people who are depressed see the problem as themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored when we're just having trouble concentrating.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape on which a person was reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard loud and unrelated television programming in the next room, others heard it so quietly that they barely noticed it, while the third group did not hear it at all.
Those who listened to the TV program quietly reported more boredom than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating but were unsure of why and attributed the problems to boredom.
When you try to focus on a difficult or challenging task, distracted attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study's authors.
On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, "like finding the wrong parts on the factory line, distracting music can help you get bored".
In fact, he said, we now know that twirling and grinding, often seen as a sign of boredom, can actually help people fight boredom and keep people physically attentive.
"Research shows that children who are allowed to spin learn and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still", said Professor Fenske.
We've all been bored at times - delayed flight, loudspeaker, especially long film.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To help measure boredom, scientists developed the Boredom Proneness Scale in the 1980's.
The degree includes questions like, "A lot of things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous", and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do them all".
Using these scales, the researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when it comes to the need for more and different external stimuli.
Teenagers, however, are generally not receptive.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment that involved contacting nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32 percent of teens reported being bored at school and doing homework, while 23 percent reported being bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he didn't know if the percentage of boredom expressed would be higher or lower now, 21 years later.
But he said he knew that "adulthood is a prime time for boredom", largely because children and youths are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question, "Is boredom good for you?"
Research shows that sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, gamble, or abuse drugs as a way to alleviate addiction.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have debated the link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has studied the problem for more than two decades.
"Boredom is the brain's way of telling you that you should do something different", said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain doesn't always know the right thing to do.
If you get bored and use that energy to play guitar and cook, you'll enjoy it.
But watching television will only make you happy for a short time, not for long.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won't get bored anymore, but he won't learn how to drive himself or himself, said Professor Fenske.
And "this independent control is transferred from one situation to another", the professor said.
Your child will not only learn to enjoy himself but will gain greater self-control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom.
But we shouldn't be too critical of her either.
Our goal should be to feel comfortable being out of touch with the constant rush of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood has agreed.
"We blame it on the need to get bored even more, but boredom is a painful, restless desire to be connected to something meaningful", he said.
What people are really looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy their free time.
"In an environment where we are constantly restimulated", he said, "it is difficult to find ways to entertain ourselves when the noise goes out".
There's no manual on the new marijuana law in Colorado.
Nineteen-year-old Anthony Orozco, a high school senior and soccer player from southeastern Colorado, faces criminal charges for something that will soon be legal across the state - possession of several grams of marijuana and the tobacco he used to smoke it.
Mr. Orozco said that one September he was driving with a few friends in Lamar, on the plains near the Kansas border, when he was stopped.
After a police officer found marijuana in his car, Mr. Orozco was summoned for possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia - petty offences punishable by a $100 fine - and given a court date.
"They treated us like criminals", said Mr. Orozco.
But he's a criminal?
In the uncertain weeks following the Colorado vote to legalize small amounts of recreational marijuana, the answer to hundreds of smaller drug cases depends on the spot rather than the law.
Hundreds of marijuana-related offenses have already been filed here and in Washington state, which has approved similar measures.
The police department has stopped charging adults 21 years and older for holding a small amount that will be legally allowed after the law takes effect in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in more conservative counties in Colorado have said they will continue to prosecute existing marijuana cases, and they still charge people with possession.
At the same time, several Denver suburbs facing the Western Mountains are voting to prevent new state-licensed marijuana businesses from opening in their communities.
"This is happening so fast, I don't know what's going to happen next", said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
The Washington State regulators are all in a row.
And they're looking for guidance on how to set up a licensing system for growing, manufacturing, distributing and selling - all by December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, for better or worse, is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana, first for medical use and now for recreation.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it's going to be a good lead", said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Licensing Board.
But as Mr. Smith admitted, no place or system can do more than suggest what might work.
"There is no real precedent that we can follow", he said.
Washington's law, the so-called I-502, takes effect on December 6, which also leaves an annual vacuum during which there will not be a state licensing system yet, but legal possession will.
And there are tangled mechanical issues that need to be addressed during this time, such as how to balance a state directive on "appropriate access" to licensed marijuana with its prohibition on the sale of cannabis within 330 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds or children's centers.
"There will be nowhere more difficult to place a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area", said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a newly formed research group.
On November 21, Aurora Police Chief Oates emailed his officers announcing that the city prosecutor would no longer prosecute individuals for possession of small amounts of marijuana for every citizen over 21 years of age and that police would "immediately" stop charging people with these crimes.
Chief Oates said police will enforce city laws regulating medical marijuana growers and will continue to prosecute drug dealers and dealers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck is offering a more rigorous look.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to prosecute marijuana possession cases, mostly as a way to pressure users into seeking treatment.
Currently, 119 people are facing charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many are facing additional charges.
"Our office is required to prosecute offences that were criminal at the time they occurred", Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The reaction was complicated even in places like rural Mesa, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, no longer charge adults with small amounts.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supports this decision, but he also decided not to rule out all ongoing detention cases.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time continuing to enforce law until it changes", he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the hands of the government and legal system will never be easy.
And the conflicting reactions across the state have revealed a deep division among local officials over this big state green experiment.
For district attorneys, this is a "cultural barrier", said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer representing marijuana defendants, and a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They've spent so much of their lives prosecuting people that they still can't really accept it's legal", he said.
As the first states to legalize small amounts of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are best placed to be nationally tested cases for legalizing drugs.
Lawyers and state agencies are planning new boundaries for legalized marijuana sales while also anxiously awaiting guidance from the federal government, which is still planning to criminalize the sale and cultivation of marijuana.
Marijuana legal advocates are hoping the Justice Department will back down.
Despite several arrests of medical marijuana dealers and patients who use it, which have attracted attention, the federal government has largely left medical marijuana businesses in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states in operation.
While drug agents are unlikely to slam the door to catch a small bag of drugs, they are likely to resist allowing state-regulated recreational marijuana dealings permitted by new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former Obama administration drug policy adviser.
Several Colorado cities are not waiting for federal action.
Even before election day, some local governments approved a moratorium on any new marijuana dealings, although it will take about a year for any deal to open.
Last week, the city of Montrose in the western part of the state proposed a six-month ban, and it's likely to go into effect next week.
"We don't want to be in a situation where we give someone a license and then we get a big federal case out of it", said Bob Nicholson, a city councilman.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We're looking at what the city council voted for, versus what the state voted for.
There's a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave Oxford because I am a conservative".
It's not just college students today who are being attacked for their views.
I don't remember ever dreaming of going to Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother were studying at a university I thought was the world's greatest center of knowledge, a modern, curved Greek symposium motivating the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
And so, in the late 1980s, two weeks after I entered Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, I packed my suitcases and got caught up in the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and cried.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said I gave up because I objected to student love in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson said in a humorous way that I left because I was forced to drink from a bottle of water.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran because I was the subject of systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my somewhat bizarre name or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason only, and in this cradle of supposed enlightenment it was both bigoted and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a senior adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a Conservative.
You might ask why I'm only pulling this out now.
Simply because the latest reports suggest that a new generation of students right from the center are suffering from similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week a group of these students demanded the same equal protection as gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior College (JCR) at Corpus Christi College claim that because of their political views, they are "often actively isolated, exposed to personal attacks, and shown not to be welcome".
They call for a position on the university's Equal Opportunity Committee to ensure that they can express their views freely.
Their situation was not helped by a recent BBC Two documentary Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right about student politics, which the Conservatives described as bizarre and neo-Nazi.
The programme featured graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who rode a Rolls-Royce, wore a silver suit and had a stick with a silver head.
At other colleges, conservative students say that they are treated as "sacrificial lambs" because of the introduction of higher education.
Luke Black, 20, vice-president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told the Sunday newspaper that "the influence of the left in universities is growing.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us".
A 21-year-old Corpus Christi history student, Samuel Roberts, who supports the Greater Protection Movement, says that the climate is "uncomfortable", while 19-year-old OUCA president-elect Stephanie Cherill says that the JCR's approach to people on the right from the center has worsened.
"This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, as well as to the well-being of members", he says.
During my first few weeks at Oxford, I was a minority member.
I joined in September 1986, aged 18, and paralyzingly shy.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was the most heated.
A year earlier, the university had voted to deny honorary degrees to former student Margaret Thatcher because of the cuts in funding for higher education.
Even the Stalinists would be shaken by fear.
During the first few days of the opening week, when the new students meet each other and with the professors, I got a taste of the vagina that was supposed to come.
I found that not only do professors quietly approve of the pranking of conservative students, but they're willing to participate.
The timber-framed audience was led by a policy of mining strike, privatization and government resistance to anti-apartheid sanctions in the South African Republic.
My first lecture was about translating an 18th-century French text into English, and I wasn't prepared for what followed.
"Sir Wyatt", said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph".
I was pretty hard on myself.
Professor Pitt, a little man with a face like a cake pie, was very yellowish.
"Do the Thatcherites refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students were laughing.
I was tears in my eyes.
"I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your spare time, unless you're too busy with social matters", Professor Pitt concluded.
I went back to my room, crushed.
I was sitting alone at school dinner when I felt a slight pat on the shoulder.
He was a sophomore named James, who introduced himself as a member of OUCA.
"I know who you are", he said politely.
Unfortunately, it is.
Anyone suspected of being a conservative is a target.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna get worse for you.
Most conservative leaders pretend to be Labour.
Later, at the local pub, I tried to pretend cowardly.
I insisted I disagreed with everything Thatcher said.
This trick proved to be a failure.
A first-year philosophy, politics and economics student who (what an irony) went to Eton said, "You're the daughter of a fascist pig".
You're infected.
The other students took notes with him.
I was a pervert, dirty.
"How do conservatives love each other?" one asked.
They're beating each other, right?
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I ever live a normal life at Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Should I turn into a laborer and suppress my natural inclinations?
Three years have developed before me as a purifier of ignorance and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who was on my faculty.
He was hated not only for being conservative, but also for being Margaret Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of her keynote speakers.
He was almost there.
He hated the place for its provinciality and pettyness and its attachment to a Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997, he took up a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here", he told me.
I began to drive from Oxford to my parents' home in London, seeking refuge with my uninterested metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world", he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in a city of dream moods.
Even my communist friends were always perfectly manners.
His blurred eyes were smiling.
Try it again.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
Tired of frequent trips to London, my emotional resilience was deteriorating.
My friend, also a Conservative, succumbed to pressure and renounced his convictions.
The following week, during class, when another history professor declared me "the enemy of the people" in earnest, I decided to do the same.
Even though I was deeply embarrassed, I admitted that my parents brainwashed me and called them "old fools".
The relief was short-lived.
My father put a nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At the time, he wrote two columns a week for Murdoch's newspaper.
My door was locked.
I snuck in, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my bags and caught the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a sloppy weakling.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be subjected to such intimidation and poisoning in an educational institution.
Even more tragic, Oxford was not only the birthplace of 14 conservative prime ministers, but also the unmerited reputation of a place of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: master of fashion design", which opened this week in London, ABC spoke to Natta Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemis and other famous customers of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, the ancient residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting the exhibition of Valentin Garavani.
The designer confirmed this when he opened the celebrated retrospective "Valentino: Master of Fashion Design", which features more than 130 high fashion models created by his studio over the past 50 years.
"I love this castle", he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition concludes a story in which "il signore" Garavani is the only protagonist, but without his esteemed clients could not have been written.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the remote and rare world of the aristocracy.
The first exhibition hall, which runs until 3 March, is packed with private correspondence and photographs with signatures from the most prominent nobles, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to the Greek Princess Maria Chantal and Margaret of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino exhibits these personal memories as trophies of his social upbringing: from a simple tailor from the northern Italian town of Voghera to an idol of the international "bohemian cream".
There's nothing wrong with loving the royal family.
"At least they don't stick a cigarette in a great carpet like some great pop music celebrities do", says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemis.
In the '60s and '70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and the guests enjoy a lot of fun and elegance.
"We were all very happy to be invited to his cottage in Gstaad", explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen and a close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
"Valentino always preferred elegance to fame.
And yet he is a star".
Valeria Mazz is showing Valentine's Day
The Argentine model Valeria Mazz has also been a charismatic designer.
"It has been many years since we went to his house for dinner after a show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
There were 20 of us, and we had Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of his apartment, in the decorations, the food, the music, in everything, he reflected himself and felt his spirit.
He made all his guests feel important and loved", recalls the top model who began working with him during Paris Fashion Week in 1995.
"He never goes out of style because his designs are works of art", he concludes.
The show of nobility
Gravani's life is not a story of obsession, but of true love.
He loves people with good upbringing and better titles and they love him.
One of Somerset House's galleries has been rebuilt on a feature seventy-metre-long passage offering a role-switching: a visitor turns into a model and walks the passage to observe the "sacrifice" of dreams that Valentine's masterpieces are wearing, such as the dress Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, the costume Monica Vitti wore in "Night", or the coat of fur and wool that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
In the audience, the models are represented by Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria and Sophie of Habsburg.
Naty Abascalová and the designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentine's Day is like a first love, "you can't forget it".
"I remember it perfectly.
They were pants, shirts, a guillotine jacket and a jacket from the fall-winter 1971-72 collection.
It was a gift he made for me", says Naty Abascal, one of the designer museums.
"I prefer his femininity and his great love for women to others because it emphasizes our beauty", adds the former Duchess of Ferry.
"I like the colors she uses, the brightness and the brightness on her face.
The proportions are perfect".
Not even Princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can forget how she first dressed Valentine.
When she was growing up and living in Italy, she wanted to be an adult and have the opportunity to wear one of his evening gowns...
She finally arrived in the late '90s.
"I bought my first Valentine's dress for a party at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edward de Ligne.
They were red dresses with skirts with a skirt, a strap-on skirt and a top without shoulders.
It was a dream come true", says the widow of Rodrigue d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is lax about fashion, his passion is timeless", explains the Italian aristocrat, whose life spans Paris, New York, and Buenos Aires.
The Princess d'Arenberg has arranged the designer's wedding dress "very carefully... because the dress is not just a dress, it's also a collection of memories that they have inside".
The "King" of Fashion
The gold standard of the Somerset House exhibition is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller from her wedding to Paul Grecque in 1995.
The ivory-colored, pearly silk dress, 12 different types of knitwear, and a four-and-a-half-meter-long tow took four months of work and 25 "skins" (as the designer calls his knitwear).
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the leading authority on specialized print, these dresses represent the epicenter of late-20th-century fashion, "the return of college-age women".
Valentino, who has been embraced by the elitist "savoir-être" over the years, is now his best example.
He is a knight of the Legion of Honor and is the recipient of the highest honour of the Italian Order of the Grand Cross, the Cavaliere del Lavoro, the Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and the Legion of Honor.
"I have always been fascinated by his choice, calmness, neatness, and perfect appearance", admits Princess d'Arenberg.
"I last saw him a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musee d'Orsay.
He was at a table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, my great friend.
He was flawless, time left no trace of him".
When the princess says so...
The toughest craft in the world: sulphur bearers in the Kawah Ijen volcano area
For four euros, Indonesian volcano carriers risk their lives and health carrying 70 kilos of sulfur down steep rocky paths.
There are people whose work is hell, and there are people who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anta Wijayi, one of 400 miners who make a living from the sulfur extraction of Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
For this reason, it must sink to the bottom of the crater every day, where sulphur gases escape from the Earth's interior and enter a solid state when exposed to air.
After cutting up large blocks of sulfur, weighing up to 70 pounds [70 kg] together, he carries them on his shoulders in two bamboo baskets along steep rocky paths.
The volcano's summit, which rises to 2,386 feet [2,386 m], is only 250 feet [250 m], but it takes over 40 minutes for exhausted climbers to climb up at a steep pace, as they maintain balance and carefully weigh their steps so as not to slip and fall into a ravine.
They know that any stumbling could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who fell from the rocks of Kawah Ien years ago.
Miners in Kawah only earn five cents for every kilo of sulfur they mine
When they're upstairs, they're making their way around tourists who photograph them like monkeys in a circus, and they're tired of carrying heavy baskets to the weight that the mining company has placed a little lower, at 1,850 meters above sea level.
It is a company called PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been mining in the volcano since 1960 and has never paid its workers more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilo of sulphur.
He then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as it has its place in everyday life and is used to make fireworks, amusing pyrotechnics, cosmetics, dynamite, and even to bleach sugar.
"Because we normally carry 70 kilograms, we make about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each trip", explains Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
One trip takes him three hours and he ends up ruined, but he can earn 138,000 rupees a day.
Although it may seem like a negligible sum for such a disproportionate amount of effort, it's three times what he would earn on the field.
"The daily wage of miners is very high here, for example, for collecting coffee, 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day, and for 14 days, two million rupees (167 euros) a day", explains a carrier who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a farmer.
There he was paid 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a serious reason that is as convincing as sulfur in Indonesia: "I married a young girl from Bali who is a Hindu, and I took her to Java to convert to Islam".
Ant has asthma, bad breath, coughing all the time, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At the age of 27, Anto risks his life three times a day in the Kawah Ijen volcano, whose sulfur has already begun to collect its toll on him, despite his face being protected by a special mask and glasses.
He has asthma, shortness of breath, coughing all the time, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases leaking from the volcano.
That's the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
"I'll work for another two years because I want to open a business or study Spanish or French", he promises more than a fluent English.
This nice, intelligent young man, who was destined to be a tour guide, a waiter, or a hotel receptionist, could be a carrier instead.
She shares her dirty wooden cottage with other carrier and wakes up every day at two o'clock in the morning because the sulfur keeps pouring at night and its characteristic yellow color changes to blue and glows in darkness.
Through the darkness around Ant's lighthouse, into a crater and illuminates his path with a small lamp which he has on his helmet and bought for his own money.
About 400 carriers carry a basket of sulfur from the bottom of the crater on their shoulders
Although the company has high incomes, it has not mechanised the extraction of sulphur for cost savings, nor does it provide any equipment for self-employed carriers and with such efforts.
In fact, they do not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) of the photography fee, which, along with a 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) ticket, is collected by the park guards from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human moles.
"This work is for cattle, not for people", says Madrusin, a 42-year-old veteran carrier who has been working in Kawah-e-Iwa for three decades since leaving school.
She can lift up to 110 pounds and assures us that she will work "as long as possible" because she needs money to pay for the education of her three sons, ages 18 to 10.
I'm not retiring, I'm dying here because the volcano has been my whole life.
Although sulfur burns the throat and the eyes when the wind suddenly turns and engulfs the miners in the thick fumes that come out of the volcano, the miners are so adamant that none of them complain of serious illnesses... but this is evident from their frequent breathing problems, osteoarthritis, knee pain, and shoulder injuries caused by weight of the crotch.
A man who weighs his basket on his back can only lift 50 pounds at the age of 53.
Each day, he and his colleagues release 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which is then transported by three trucks along a steep path between the logs to a storage facility in Tamansari, 18 kilometers [18 miles] away.
"I'm not retiring, I'm dying here because the volcano has been my whole life", Unainik declares, opening a wide mouth that lacks several teeth.
The eldest of his five sons, aged 30, also makes his living from the mining of sulfur.
Time passes, but the constant misery of one of the world's toughest crafts continues from generation to generation - the crafts that human mills do in Kawah Iljen.
Singapore is looking for a baby to save the economy
Singaporeans are deceived by the fact that they have no children, for careers, stress, and the cost of living and education.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow".
I am married and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, so let's fulfill our civic duty and start a new life!
It may seem incredible that this slogan is part of a menthol candy ad, but nonetheless -- or perhaps that's why -- the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These are part of the rap that uses local "put a buck in the oven" slang as a derision of the birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency BBH that created the video hopes that this ad will help them raise awareness of the problem in a humorous way.
Douglas Hamilton, the agency's artistic director, says he wanted to use the influence of music to help people fulfill "their civic duty".
"It's all about the Internet, so it had to be fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We're the worst reproducing population in the world, so we felt it was a topic we had to touch.
We knew the government was trying a lot of things like spreading pheromones and perfume or hosting dating parties.
Many of these ideas could have been more creative, but not entirely functional.
So we thought, why not do the most creative thing we could, like compose rap, to solve this problem".
1.2 children
The one who doesn't take it too lightly is the Singapore government.
They're spending $1,300 a year to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government's marriage and family package provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and allocates financial benefits.
All these measures had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for its conservative officials and strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore, in terms of population distribution, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time the birth rate exceeded 2, which is considered a recovery rate, was in 1976.
Why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the National Bureau of Population's Department of Marriage and Family, says it's because of "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities".
"So people have a wider range of options when it comes to life goals and priorities, not just marriage and family", he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in single people and to postponing marriage and childbearing, resulting in a decline in the birth rate in Singapore.
While there were efforts under immigration policy to drastically increase the influx of immigrants as a measure against population decline, this sparked resentment among locals.
Some Singaporean websites show a deep xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticized for maintaining low wages and little integration efforts.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons the Singaporean government party had its worst election result since independence last year.
After the election, there was an attempt to solve the problem with quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unforeseen Consequences
While the decline in birth rates is known to have implications for national economic growth, tax revenues, healthcare spending and immigration policy, there have also been some unexpected consequences in the case of Singapore.
The government is trying to keep so many small houses from getting built.
For example, she started influencing the real estate business.
The Office of Urban Development has begun regulating the number of small housing units known as "shoe boxes" that can be built in certain urban areas.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and have been very successful in sales.
However, there are concerns that these apartments may promote a youth lifestyle and discourage developers from building large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of the developer company EL Developers, claims that their "shoe boxes" sell much faster than larger homes.
"They are more popular, selling days or weeks faster than larger homes.
That's why they're so much better for our cash flow".
However, it admits that the new standards set clearer rules for developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
Too stressed out
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules could aim to increase the nation's fertility rate, an interview with Singaporeans working in the downtown financial district suggests they won't have much effect.
"People are still stressed, homes are expensive, and education is expensive, so many people put it off", says a young official.
"Let the rest of them have children.
But it is important for me to rely on my own money and time", says another young man, in his early 20's.
Men and women cite careers, stress, and the cost of living and education as reasons why they are unable to have children.
So no matter how hard the government tries to force citizens to have children, it's the Singaporeans who have the final say on how to start a family.
What's private offline is private online.
It's a little private.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, it is a personal matter or "an area of private life that everyone has the right to protect against any interference".
What's privacy for a person under 16?
How does he apply this definition to his daily life and social media?
Does he understand the danger of posting things on the Internet that he would certainly not tell anyone in normal communication?
Journalists from elPeriódico interviewed five boys and girls between the ages of 10 and 15 who are frequent Internet users.
In four cases, they considered the concept of privacy to be "something entirely personal" on a personal level and "username and password" when it came to social networks.
"I wouldn't reveal my biggest secret", says 10-year-old Jorge, trying to explain the importance of privacy on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail, and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"They're very secret, my mom may know about them, but not the whole world", he says.
"I put nice pictures on FB or pictures of us playing.
I'm also talking to people I know.
I wouldn't share a picture that wasn't mine, or a picture that made someone laugh", she says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to post obscene photographs, photographs of naked people, or photographs of crimes, or to write humiliating or rude comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends he has on FB and his nine Twitter followers.
Most of them are relatives.
Among them is a mother who has the name and password of one of the accounts.
"I started a Twitter account to express my views and write interesting posts.
I don't know if anyone will answer, I just put them there", he adds.
"Social media is fun, I can talk to relatives who are far away or communicate quickly with friends", she says.
He says without hesitation that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
He wouldn't even care if someone recommended him to someone he didn't know.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and on the latter, he admits not to know 20 people on his friends list.
"I'm not worried about it, because we have something in common, like music", she says.
According to this boy, none of them had ever lied to him or asked for his address or phone number.
"If they pressed me or demanded that I do, I would simply delete them from my account", she admits.
Jose signed up for Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
These boys are no strangers to what is now called cyberbullying.
"A well-known friend was blackmailed on social media.
They threatened him and demanded money.
He never knew who it was", he confirms.
The victim didn't log in from the account, according to Josh.
"She just activated the private regime".
Then he explains a series of steps on how to set up the account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would post pictures of famous people in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
"Of course I would if I had a problem or if I just wanted to.
Even though I know it's cyberbullying", he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and a graduate of Education and Teaching, believes that in order to be well oriented on social networks, children and adolescents need to understand that the main purpose of these networks is to inform.
It states: "The Internet was born as a means of information gathering, but with the advent of social media, the rules of the game have changed".
Marrielos Porras notes that academic Marc Prensky, a graduate student in education at Yale University and author of the paper Digital Natives and Digital Immigrants, introduced these concepts to explain the phenomenon.
"Digital natives are children and young people born in the age of this technology.
We are digital immigrants who have to teach them, and we are just learning ourselves", he says.
He explains that this is a complex subject, "because we ask them to recognize what is appropriate to disseminate, publish and say and what is not, at an age when they are not yet mature enough".
They also need to be environmentally conscious at a time when what they want most is to be popular, to have thousands of friends and not think about the consequences".
According to this specialist, the most effective way to show children and adolescents what privacy is is by asking thought-provoking questions.
"Telling them not to do something doesn't work", he adds.
Marrielos Porras also lists some of the possibilities: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why do you do it online?
Or, "Would you like someone to post your picture like you posted your friend's?"
You know what other people are saying about you?
When you're marking people in party photos, have you asked those people for permission?
And one more: Do you need everyone to know what you're doing all the time?
The next point is to realize that they have to behave in the Internet as well as outside of it.
It's the same rules.
"Outside the Internet, people are guided by respect, morality, and other principles, and the same should be true of social media", he says.
Control
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, first-grade teacher and education advisor, explains that it is essential for parents to read the rules of social media carefully.
"If they understand the complexities of each, they have a good reason to talk to their children about the consequences of opening an online account.
For example, about age or what is allowed to be shared or published", he says.
Guardia believes that it is essential to remind children of the traditional "don't talk to strangers" rule.
The South American Summit is over and the Limassol Declaration is not published
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) in Peru today ended without the release of the Declaration of Limits, which was announced and reportedly signed by the seven presidents present.
EFE has repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the sixth Unasur Summit, but representatives of the Foreign Ministry and the Office of the President, who initially set out to publish the document after the summit, said it would be published later on the Peruvian government's website.
They also said that the content was published by Peruvian President Ollanta Humala in several brief press releases.
Journalists had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the meeting, a video of the presidential meeting was broadcast in the press room with the message "Confidential meeting, No Sound Transmission".
The small amount of information that the journalists had was provided by press representatives of some governments who were present but not by Peruvian representatives.
The only document released during the meeting was a list of presidents attending, prompting hundreds of journalists from various national and international media to ask for more information.
The Peruvian presidential office later sent an e-mail with a "concluding statement" from the summit, but this is only a statement by President Humala, not an official document that concluded the summit.
Last October Peru hosted the third summit of South American and Arab countries (América del Sur-Países Árabes, ASPA) and even on this occasion the originally promised Declaration of Lima was not published, despite press press urges.
The official website of ASPA states that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, Peruvian authorities tried to ensure broadcasting for all journalists, but they completely prevented the transmission of information.
The Summit concluded, inter alia, with Chile and Peru's joint commitment to accept the judgment of the Hague Court of Justice, which resolves the border dispute between the two countries.
President Ollanta Humala of Peru and President Sebastián Piñera of Chile met during a regional meeting and confirmed that they would respect the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which will begin hearing the defence of both parties on Monday to hear the dispute initiated by Lima against Santiago.
"We will proceed and execute a ruling that resolves the dispute we are hearing today in this international court", President Humala said along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful dispute resolution, conventions and international courts", Piñera added, welcoming President Humalu with a handshake on the flags of both countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they will submit to the decision of the International Court of Justice was made public after Colombia adopted the Bogotá Pact this week, expressing its submission to the judgments of the international court that ruled on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, and Colombia considered this decision to be completely wrong.
The summit was held without the participation of the Presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chavez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay was excluded from Unasur in 2011 following the removal of then President Fernando Luga and did not attend the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala was commissioned to begin the morning speeches and conclude the Lima Summit shortly after noon.
The President read the final document, which reported that 16 agreements had been signed and 31 projects were planned between South American countries, with an investment of $17 billion.
In addition to the agreements adopted, he noted that UNASUR member states would take "important steps towards the South American citizenship goal for which residence agreements are being extended".
He said that actions were being encouraged to improve "cooperation in the fight against civil uncertainty and international organized crime, to improve access to medicine and affordable Internet in all corners of South America, and to take joint and effective action against the risks of natural disasters".
When Europe is in crisis, "economic consolidation (Latin America) is not to be a winning factor, but to serve to increase our productivity and show our nations a better future", added Humala.
"We have decided to prioritise a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve transport connectivity between different parts of South America, especially rural and border areas . . . so that our countries are better connected and create new economic ties", the Peruvian president said in a statement read.
He mentioned that five of these projects concern Peru and its coastal-to-Brazil cross-border axis and two others concern better connectivity with Ecuador, but did not give further details.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to bring it back to the Union of South American Nations", which it is currently excluded from.
Another issue highlighted by the summit was the need for Latin America to remain a prosperous and peaceful region that is integrated and has good neighbourly relations.
In this regard, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before attending a regional meeting that he hoped to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, in Mexico on Saturday to respectfully discuss the International Court of Justice's ruling on the maritime border dispute, which is disputed by Bogotá.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday) I will meet with President Daniel Ortega", Santos said.
"We will discuss all solutions, none excluded, nor a treaty with Nicaragua that would require negotiations with this country", he stressed.
"I hope I can tell President Ortega that we should conduct the negotiations in the most civilized and unambiguous way possible", Santos added.
Santos and Ortega are meeting in Mexico on Saturday to attend the inauguration of President Enrique Peña Nieta.
The EU Defence Ministers met in the framework of the summit in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
The members of UNASUR are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the latter is currently excluded.
Peru is the interim chairman of this regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn from Europe
President Rafael Correa announced today that the goal of creating a common citizenship is one in which "South America, in this case, really needs to learn from Europe".
Correa, who attended the sixth presidential summit of the United Nations (UNASUR) in Lima, told state TV TV Perú that Europeans "killed each other in World War II" and other conflicts, "but now they are practically one homeland".
In this regard, he defended the South American Citizenship Project, which is supported by the Unasur Member States.
"The free movement of citizens and workers within any South American country that is already taking place among the members of the Andean Community must be achieved, but there are still backward areas that want to take us back to the past", he warned.
The President of Ecuador expressed his agreement to the regroupment of the Organization of American States (OAS) on the condition that the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States be reduced and those who signed the San José Covenant on Human Rights be taken into account.
"The leaders never commit to anything, and we South Americans sign everything.
It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is funded in Washington by the United States", he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
President Correa confirmed that he did not regret this decision because it did not betray his principles and respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that at the time "there were reasonable suspicions that Assange could be extradited to a third country regardless of the ongoing trial".
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary for asking him to be interrogated on Swedish territory for an alleged sexual offence, while "Swedish legislation allows for interrogations by videoconference, which could be conducted from the Ecuadorian embassy in London".
Mr. Correa said there was a risk that Assange's physical and mental health would deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he's been at our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he has minor lung problems, but nothing serious", said the Ecuadorian head of state.
"But his physical and mental condition is threatened by the fact that he is confined to a small space without the possibility of movement in the fresh air.
That would mark everyone's health", he added.
President Correa noted that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on the basis of a permit allowing him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European courts, and stressed that talks were underway with London to resolve the imprisonment of the WikiLeaks founder.
"We don't negotiate human rights, we don't use that word in this case, but there's been a lot of talk.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European courts, as Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzón leads a series of proceedings in various European courts", he said.
He said that "if Britain issues a release tomorrow, it's over".
And if Sweden does interview Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or via Skype, as is without problem permitted by the legislation there and as has already been done in other cases, tomorrow this problem will be ended".
Correa took advantage of the situation to present himself as a champion of press freedom, making it clear that he strongly does not tolerate "sub-average, bad intentions, and lies that undermine freedom of expression".
The greatest enemies of the free press are not us, the villainous and perverse politicians, but bad journalists in the service of profit, pressure and blackmail", he said.
In this view, he expressed his joy that neither such journalists nor "banksmen nor hegemonic countries nor bourgeoisie rule Ecuador", adding that if re-elected, "the changes will continue to be made in the right direction".
President Correa also supported the decision to continue to maintain Paraguay's veto on Unasur's membership until at least its next election, arguing that the whole "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and coup d'état shrouded in legality", because in fact it "destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian President also stated that he considered it "quite appropriate" for his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between the two countries now, in the aftermath of the judgment of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which ruled in favor of Nicaragua.
The verdict is not currently accepted.
"It's a problem between South America and Central America.
Conflict is inevitable, but it must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They need to be assessed broadly to be overcome and to be able to move forward".
He also expressed hope that the maritime border dispute, which is being settled in the same Peruvian and Chilean courts, would be resolved, and expressed the view that "it is right for Latin America to seek international courts if both countries agree to accept a judgment, however severe".
Regarding the possibility of running in the next presidential election in Ecuador to run for a third term, he noted that he sees this opportunity "with great optimism and joy, even if it is sometimes very difficult".
Correa has declared that if he loses the February 2013 election, he will retire from public life.
"I have never been personally interested in power, but such unjust situations as socio-economic poverty in Ecuador can only be remedied by political power.
My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, so we must accept this responsibility", he said.
"If I won, it would be my last term as president and then I would retire from politics.
If we lose, I'll have the same.
I've made my decision", he said.
Correa also mentioned the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
"I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who says that President Chávez has gone to a scheduled routine treatment and was expected to return to Cuba after the campaign ended.
This is not a relapse in the president's health", he explained.
The Head of State of Ecuador attended today the sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to maintain development, equality and security.
Victims of AIDS today are the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizi was 21 when he was confirmed HIV positive.
"It was like a flash of lightning struck me", she recalls, recalling a moment of truth that the doctor tried to "soften up a little", but apparently without success.
The boy kept it from the family.
He decided to take his illness to his own devices and began to learn about it, with such dedication that he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV Unit at the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), where he joined in 1994 after several struggles with the disease.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something unimaginable in the early 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and greater stigma.
Even the director of the Mexico Institute for Social Security (IMSS) clinic did not say goodbye to him "because he had a cutting wound".
Back then, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it's possible to survive with this syndrome and live fully.
However, many people do not know about their illness and only come to know about it after the virus has destroyed the body and activated the immune system, and then become victims of random infections.
31 years since the world's first recorded cases of AIDS, or at least the first documented cases, "are a great achievement that the life expectancy of a patient who begins treatment in a timely and appropriate manner is exactly the same as that of healthy people", said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV Unit at the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara, confirming this information in a prestigious scientific publication in April this year.
Infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS specialist Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have concluded that since 2008, AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the length of survival and full life depends on the degree of immune system impairment of the patients diagnosed with the disease, with those who do not use drugs being better off: people with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years and people with 500 CD4 cells up to 50 years.
Simply put, this means that a person diagnosed with HIV at age 25 can "live without problems up to 75 years if treatment is followed", the doctor explained in an interview.
To highlight this progress, it is appropriate to recall that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although death rates have declined significantly in recent years and the number of people who died of AIDS in Mexico has fallen from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UN's Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS - UNAIDS), it is also true that, according to national statistics, 60 percent of AIDS-related deaths have occurred since the outbreak.
In 2011, 255 people died in Jalisco alone, and as of May this year, 187 people have died. However, since 2005, universal access to antiretroviral drugs has been ensured.
Why do people still die from disease?
"I don't think the problem is with access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's how it's done at our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years, we have not exhausted our medicines. The problem is that patients arrive at a very advanced stage because they do not know the status of the disease, or the late stage of the disease".
He adds: "Nine out of ten patients come when they have a related infection, and the only thing to do to increase the overall mortality rate is to diagnose the disease early, and so large-scale testing is needed for all those who request it".
He agrees with the specialists and officials of the Jalisco State AIDS Prevention Council and with patients like Fabrizio, who came to get tests done in a private lab just because a friend had done it, and despite his young age, he had AIDS and also had Kaposi's sarcoma, a tumor disease that is one of the common complications.
"Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die, and they don't want to know anything else.
"If I'm going to die, I'd rather get out of here three times a week", they say, but that's not my case.
I've changed for the better, eating healthy, exercising, taking medication".
To this day, all his parents know is that he had cancer.
"I'm living a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead an active sex life, but responsibly, I take care of myself and my partner", says Fabrizio, who accepted the invitation to share his experience with the MILENIO JALISCO daily to motivate those who are afraid by his testimony on World AIDS Day.
"Let them get tested. If they're at risk, let them know as soon as possible if they're HIV positive, and if they've been diagnosed, let them know that they can live like anyone else if they're responsible".
This message summarizes the keynote address for the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms at the counter
There is a huge gap between health programs and ordinary citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajara journalist who investigates HIV information.
And the biggest gap is in prevention.
In places that do this, "the distribution of condoms has really increased, we used to get one or two, now we get a hundred condoms in packages, which is very good, but there are still people who don't have access to condoms", he said.
Adolescents are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
"What do you want it for?" is a common question filled with irony and judgment from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy staff, and health care workers that teens want to avoid, says the reporter.
He proposed changing this inefficient distribution so that condoms are not just on the counter but in the 100s in the dosers in public toilets, in places where young people often go.
"It's not promoting promiscuity.
It's not even about "paying for a beer and a motel", as Governor Emilio González responded to a question about whether he would approve of distributing condoms in his district.
It's best to make condoms available to those who are already having sex", he said.
Key numbers in the State of Jalisco
There were 13,435 cases of AIDS (12,158 cases and 1,317 cases of HIV).
This is the fourth highest number of new and confirmed cases of AIDS in Mexico and the 13th highest number of HIV cases.
92% of the infection is sexually transmitted, 6% is blood-borne and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people may live with HIV, since there are four to five people per recorded case who are unaware of the disease.
The judgment upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which does not recognise the restructuring of Grupo Vitro's debt due to bankruptcy in Mexico, sets an unfortunate precedent for any national enterprise with branches in a neighbouring country and a solvency problem.
The restructuring procedures, which are permitted by Mexican law, do not appear to apply in the land of the stars, despite international agreements.
The approval of the judgment handed down on June 15 of last year by Judge Harlin Hall in the North Texas Bankruptcy Court leaves the Mexican company practically defenseless against the possibility of confiscation of their property on the other side of the El Bravo River.
However, the ruling opens the door for the major Mexican glassmaker to appeal to the United States Supreme Court on three occasions.
To begin with, while the judge in this case claims that creditors are to be governed by the United States insolvency law, the New Orleans-based Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals says that the main procedure is to rule on bankruptcy in Mexico.
First, this would indicate the ignorance of international procedural cooperation in insolvency cases of multinational enterprises.
In essence, a model United Nations law for the unification of international trade law was created for this purpose, which is appointed by the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Second, the judgment states that without a vote by the branches of the internal structure of the undertakings, where the debt of the parent company Vitro to the branches is recognised, the required majority for the approval of the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, Mexican law allows this possibility.
The fact is that the Vitro case was not the first to adopt this scheme.
There are half a dozen examples like Agremex and Comercial Mexicana whose in-house debt was guaranteed by the Federal Bankruptcy Court.
Furthermore, it is true that even after the votes of the branches were counted, the creditors - who had taken Vitro to court in the United States, i.e. the 'sup' funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - would not have achieved a majority.
They'd get about 45 percent to 37 percent of the vote.
The Court of Appeal shall not take this information into account.
From another perspective, the court blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 - against the backdrop of the severe economic crisis that hit the United States.
Meanwhile, the family firm of Gonzaloza Sady will appeal the new judgment directly to the Court of Appeal, so that the judgment will be held in full participation, that is, with the participation of five judges, since only three voted initially.
If he fails here, he will seek a review of the case by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
It is important to note that the Court omitted a document sent by the Mexican Government as an amicus curiae brief detailing Vitro's conduct under the Competition Act and pointing out that the company facilitated itself by relying on agreements signed by both countries to confront the law with Chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.
It also points out that the country has submitted to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules for international insolvency cases, which guarantee equality between debtors and creditors.
A two-way collision: a penalty for Vitro and the state.
The total assessment
For months, the Mexican Air Federation had been unnoticed in a criminal complaint against the former Gaston Azcárraga Andrade, who was accused of fraud, and the pilot union said the vessel had already flown.
The court, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just filed a lawsuit against the National Banking and Securities Commission, accusing it of obstructing justice.
According to it, the Authority systematically refused to report to the Prosecutor General of the Republic a transaction carried out by this businessman in which he collected 198 million pesos from IXE Bank from fideikomiso F/589 on behalf of Mexican Airlines.
The funds were most likely directed to the purchase of shares in the Hotel Professionals' Administration (Administradora Profesional de Hoteles).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the majority shareholder in the Posadas hotel chain.
The Siege of Dragon Mars
A group of local and foreign ecologists, academics, businessmen and ordinary citizens gathered at the Universidad de Caribe over the weekend to approve the creation of an association to prevent the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Kanku.
We are talking, as you know, of a huge shopping and distribution center with products from the "land of the great wall" focused on Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean, which would include a residential area for employees from 150 companies at the bottom.
Canacintra (Cámara Nacional de la Industria de Transformación) has already managed to unite the governors of the southeastern zone to confront a monumental area that would partially devastate the protected areas and which is the source of all resistance to industry.
End of the ACTA case
The request of the Senate, which was not taken into account by the Government and which required an explanation of the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican Ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by the English acronym ACTA, according to the Mexican Industrial Property Institute (Instituto Mexicano de la Propiedad Industrial), has become obsolete.
As is well known, this happened despite the fact that the Senate itself excluded the possibility of considering it a threat to freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long term
In an effort to pay off long-term debts and not affect short-term ones, homex developer is putting 500 million pesos worth of investment certificates on the market.
This series is the first of four identical ones offering interest repayments every 28 days.
Competival is born
The merger of leading IT companies such as NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet has created an association with the trade name Competival, aimed at the market for software services in Central and South America.
The investment in the business will exceed $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
World basketball champion Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has been involved in the hall sport for over 60 years and has traveled the world thanks to it.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as many memories of the history of local basketball as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he suffered a stroke in 2008, Reyes was involved in the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a junior player, a player in the National Basketball League (BSN), the owner and coach of the Vaqueros de Bayamón team in the National Basketball League, or the president of the Puerto Rican Basketball Federation.
"I've had many roles in basketball throughout my life, including several simultaneously, like being the president of the BSN National League in the 1990s, the general manager of the national team, and the president of the federation", Reyes recalled visiting reporters at Primera Hora's home in Bayamon, where he has lived for more than 50 years with Isabel, his loyal wife.
"Basketball was my life".
Reyes is not exaggerating.
The walls of his home, almost all decorated with photographs and memorabilia from his long career, bear witness to this.
Bayamón in the heart
The biggest move of all guards is the one that reminds him of his time at Los Vaqueros from the mid-1950s, where he was a player until 1982, when he also celebrated 15 years as a co-owner or team owner.
"It was my best years, the one I enjoyed the most, because I had the opportunity to participate in eight championships with the Los Vaqueros since 1967, whether as owner, co-owner, or coach.
It was a series of successful years, including five championships held from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one championship -- in 1981, when Jerome Mincy made his BSN debut.
"The team then took over from 'Cuco' Ortiz, who was an excellent leader", Reyes said.
"I remember Gene Bartow, who was a former coach here and was at the University of Alabama at Birmingham at the time, saying to me, "I have a two-foot-tall player for you.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended me to the player Raymond Gausse, who became a member of the team and one of our best shooters.
I remember him saying that if Mincy brings Bayamon a championship win, Gausse will contribute to another".
Gausse enjoyed the championship for the Los Vaqueros, but only for a short time, as he was already president of the Basketball Federation in 1988.
At the time, he wanted to devote himself to his duties and enjoy Mincy's place in the national team.
"I remember the first time we defeated the United States in the qualifying round of the Olympics in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we finished fourth, but we should have won bronze if it wasn't for the Canadian referee who let us repeat the final throw", Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you've ever seen?
He's one of the best, like the one who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the national team at the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, when we won gold and beat the United States team, which was pretty much the same as the one that blew up bronze at the World Championships.
The team not only included Mincy, Gausse, Ramón Rivas, Fica López and "Piculína" (Ortiz), but also included youngsters (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not make the team in 1990 due to knee injuries.
The men who may not have been perfectly formed, but who did manage to win the gold medal and bring us great joy, were the 1995 Olympic qualifiers in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players on the roster like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner replacing players who were ruled out for the Pan American Games in Mar de Plata, we won gold against all odds.
Who was Puerto Rico's best player?
That was without a doubt Piculin Ortiz.
His international numbers are impressive.
No Puerto Rican has achieved the level of results that Piculin has.
Not to mention his time in the various leagues he played in.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
It's very hard.
We had a very good generation, which included Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
I'm a young man who likes Leo Aril's work.
Which of your achievements in the federation do you consider the greatest?
That I was part of the most famous era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 1990s, the BSN National League had 17 teams in one season.
What didn't you prove?
There were things I wanted to do, like divide the youth categories by regions.
For example, the Ponce boys would only play in their area and compete against teams from other parts of the island only in the national play-offs.
Kids travel a lot and play a lot of games now, which is not necessary.
I also see the benefits of compulsory certifications and courses for coaches, assistant referees and referees.
- Nice to meet you.
What are you doing now?
I listen to music most of the time, watch YouTube videos of music from my time, enjoy my grandchildren, and sometimes go to basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who was always by my side.
Actor Larry Hagman has died.
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, is best known for his starring role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R". in the television series Dallas, which portrayed a man who acted recklessly and was cunning and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the predatory oil tycoon J.R. Ewing on the television series Dallas became a symbol of the 1980s famine, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned as J.R. in the new Dallas series this year, died, according to the family's official announcement, provided by Dallas production company Warner Bros. to Associated Press, on Friday afternoon from complications related to cancer.
"Larry returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he reprised the iconic role he loved most", his family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for Thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who was Hagman's wife in the original and new series, was with Hagman at the time of his death at Dallas Hospital", her agent Jeffrey Lane reported.
He brought joy to all he knew.
"He was creative, generous, fun, kind, kind, and talented, and I will miss him so much.
He was unique and lived his life to the fullest", Linda Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992, and he himself admitted to drinking heavily over the years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in his liver and Hagman underwent a transplant.
Years before the Dallas series aired, Hagman was a TV celebrity as the decent guy in the light-hearted comedy I Dream of Jeannie that aired on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive girl (a female genie) played by Barbara Eden, and takes her home to live with him.
He also starred in two short-lived sitcoms, The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His film roles included critically acclaimed roles in The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it wasn't until Hangman's masterpiece in the form of an incredibly repugnant J.R. that he reached the top of the charts.
A CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters around them aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional slogan "Who shot Jajra?" which was supposed to raise expectations about the thrilling work, where Hangman's character is nearly murdered, has caused not only a huge amount of speculation from audiences around the world, but also the risk of millions of dollars in box office receipts.
That also helped this piece set a record for viewing.
The November 1980 episode, in which the answer was revealed, was watched by an average of 41 million television viewers, making Dallas the second most watched entertainment show in history after MASH ended its run in 1983, with 50 million viewers.
J.R. was shot by his sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby).
Kristin got pregnant with J.R., and then he threatened to call her a prostitute if she didn't leave town, but there were others who had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing, a greedy greedy man with a charismatic smile: a cunning businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), to be hospitalized.
"I know what I want J.R. to have on the gravestone", Hagman said in 1988.
It should read, "Here lies the honorable citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only thing he didn't do.
Victoria Principal, who starred in the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone who was "great on and off the screen".
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable to millions of admirers around the world and in the hearts of all of us who have had the good fortune to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas series aired on TNT a few months ago with great success.
"Five episodes of the second series have already been completed and a sixth is currently filming", the network reported.
Immediately after Hangman's death, there was no statement from Warner or TNT about how the series would continue.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who made her mark in classical musicals such as South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when she gave birth to Larry in 1931, whose father was her husband, lawyer Ben Hagman.
In the early 1950's, Larry tried his luck on the New York stage, and then served in the Air Force in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young Swedish designer May Axelsson, whom he married.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he published his autobiographical book Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't put anything in there that I knew could hurt or hurt anyone", he told the Press Association.
After a liver transplant, he began promoting organ donation and volunteered at a hospital to help fearful patients.
"I advise them, I encourage them, I meet them when they go to surgery and after", he said in 1996.
I try to give them comfort in the sense of "don't worry, it's going to be a little awkward for a while, but you'll be fine".
He was also an anti-smoking activist and participated in various campaigns.
Starting a course exploring "the end of the world"
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes like nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
When religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to take a course on the end of the world this semester, he knew that there was an irresistible temptation: The end of the "long number" of Mayans, which is scheduled for December 21, was taken by many as evidence that the end of the world was coming.
Charme had no idea what was coming in the next few months: catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, a budget deficit that some call "debt Armageddon", and the growing conflict that is dragging Israel into, the place where, according to Christian theorists, the Apocalypse begins.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever", Charme told Rutgers University students in Camden, New Jersey, this week.
When you think about what's happening in the world today, like we have 30 days left, it's a really good time.
And remember, bad means good for the apocalyptic thinkers.
And he's not the only professor offering end of the world courses this semester, which is theoretically the last in history.
At Temple University, assistant professor Barry Vacker is conducting a course on "Medias, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes like nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We're looking at why these ideas spread over time", he says, "and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that govern certain human behavior".
For example, if nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, war could break out.
This month, students are analyzing apocalyptic movies and exploring how they differ from real-life examples.
"I tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, credible, and impossible", says Vacker.
On the main campus of Penn State University, Latin American history professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of art history and anthropology, gathered to organize a course simply titled The End of the World.
"We're not joining 2012 because we always count on the possibility of rearranging the course if the world doesn't end", Restall said.
Despite the "threat of collapse", students must study, develop projects and take final exams.
Penn State's final exam will be held on the eve of the Apocalypse, giving students no choice but to work "until the eve of the supposed end of the world", Restall said.
The courses have become quite popular.
"It expanded to two hours", Restall said of his high-residency course, which had 35 students enrolled.
Weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, we were getting emails asking if there was room left.
The students themselves say that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It's fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves", said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student of religion and sociology at Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey.
And so apocalyptic, secular, or religious thinking is just a matter of comfort or lack thereof.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, said he'd seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I've never heard of a class that could teach it", he said.
"I'm enjoying it".
But no student interviewed, let alone the professor, said they believed in a December 21 deadline.
"Our first project was about Mayan prediction, and in a way we're going to refute it", said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old senior at Temple University in West Chester.
"The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar", Restall said.
But he added that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture that dates back several centuries, that people respond to changes in their environment with predictions of the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a surge of speculation.
"Otherwhere people don't think about it", he said.
That's what happens in the vast majority of the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University, who is lecturing in the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew of a course there about "the end of the world".
"The Philippines will not participate in the end of the world", he wrote, indicating an exception to the supreme authority.
We have the grace of the Pope.
Restall noted that many days of the Last Judgment had been discussed over the years, and he said that if nothing happened on December 21, "people would immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 would be the beginning of a seven-year period at the end of which the world would end.
Students and professors take the date lightly.
Some of them said they were planning to attend the "end of the world" celebrations.
"I guess I'll call a few friends and have a laugh", explained 20-year-old communication student Samira Ford.
