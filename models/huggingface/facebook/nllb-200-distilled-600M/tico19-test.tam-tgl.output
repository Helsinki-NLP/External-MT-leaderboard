You know I have diabetes
You said you had this chest pain
Rapidly increasing incidence of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) in the EU/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
The progressive trend in the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) has ensured that the COVID-19 pandemic, with different build-ups depending on the country, is progressing rapidly in all countries, showing a similar trend in the EU/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom.
In light of the experience gained from Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units, healthcare, especially those in need of intensive care, should increase their preparedness to increase the number of COVID-19 patients.

According to the available evidence, approximately 80% of individuals infected with COVID-19 have had moderate illnesses, i.e., respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, and most of these have recovered.
COVID-19 becomes an additional serious illness that requires hospitalization in approximately 14% of cases, while the remaining 6% are exposed to severe illness that requires intensive care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
In this study, we assessed the COVID-19 sequence in each EU/EEA country and in the UK and compared them to Hubei Province, China.
Comparison of current COVID-19 cases in the EU/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom with the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020 in Italy.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/European Economic Area and the UK.
COVID-19 spread more geographically than China and the current COVID-19 outbreak in the rest of the world is in the same state as in this country.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a plague.
Spiteri and others reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) in the March 5, 2020 issue of EuroVelance.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were those who returned to France from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, on 24 January 2020.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected in 30 countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, so that, as of 31 December 2019, there have been 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths, including 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Subsequent counts and incidents of COVID-19 are being obtained.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the Ministry of Health, National and Regional Health Authorities and the World Health Organization, worldwide, only updated at 8 am daily with official figures on COVID-19 cases reported.
The data were used to assess the trend of COVID-19 in the EU/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom and to compare them with the trend in Italy.
In response to the COVID-19 outbreak area, we calculated the 14-day fast total incidence of COVID-19 cases, taking into account the natural course of COVID-19 in each EU/European Economic Area country and in the United Kingdom, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
As of 8 am on 15 March 2020, we have provided a staggered number of cases per country, as compared to Italy, for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trend in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trend of 14 days of rapid overall incidence of COVID-19 in the EU/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom follows the trend of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
The gradual increase in COVID-19 spread to the EU/European Economic Area as a whole and the United Kingdom began on February 21 and then increased rapidly on February 28, 2020 (subject).

Figure 2 shows the total number of COVID-19 cases available in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
As of 8am on March 15, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom have already recorded the number of cases in Italy, with a relatively low number of cases, just three weeks earlier or earlier.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the EU/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom.

In the beginning of March 2020, doctors from affected areas of Italy reported that about 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in those areas had reached their maximum capacity.
Data on COVID-19 admitted to hospital and/or intensive care unit is currently available at 6% and 1% respectively at EU/EEA level (data not shown).
However, they should be collected in a formal manner to support current monitoring data that focuses on the number of reported cases and deaths.
The difference between intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe was highlighted in a 2010-11 study, which was 29.2 per 100,000 in Germany and 4.2 per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (in 2010-11, 12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 people).
In the context of healthcare capacity concentration-related samples, the ECTC has issued a sixth update on COVID-19-related rapid case assessment for each EU/European Economic Area country and the United Kingdom, where the number of patients is estimated to be at a 90% higher risk of increasing than the number of beds in the ICU among those infected with COVID-19.
The EU/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom have so far established disease outbreak groups and as hospitals and intensive care units are normally serving the regional population, information on cases and critical care beds should be made available in the NTS-2 monastery, which is the border section for statistics.
Experience from Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 epidemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units must prepare themselves to respond to the growing social spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the growing number of COVID-19 cases, especially in the affected regions of Italy.
The recent ECTC Rapid Risk Assessment indicates that shifting the mitigating approach from control to a proactive and all-inclusive approach to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is necessary, and if not implemented in advance, the expected rapid increase in the number of infected will not take time for decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept, adapt and respond adequately.
Rapid Risk Assessment lists public health measures to limit the impact of the pandemic.
There is a small window of opportunity where countries can use it to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2, reduce the crisis on the healthcare sector and further increase control efforts.
Failure to do so may mean that in the coming days or weeks, healthcare systems in the European Union/EEA countries that have grown tired of the huge increase in the number of patients requiring intensive care may have to deal with.
2019 Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) - has so far killed 3,000 people in China and the rest of the world, affected 80,000 people and disastrously affected humans.

The membrane spike (S) glyco protein binds to its cell receptors, angiotensin-transforming enzyme 2 (ACE2) and peptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively, after which membrane binding occurs.
RNA (RNA) is released into the nucleus of the pathogen; after the pathogenic gene duplication, a mature pathogenic RNA (RNA) with a freezing glycoprotein and a protein-containing transcriptional subunit is formed, which, in combination with the pathogen, can exhibit the pathogen.
The first genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 was recorded on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was discovered to be a new strain of beta-CoV with a genetic identification of more than 99.98% among 10 sequence patterns collected at the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan, where the outbreak originated.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically similar to SARS-CoV rather than MERS-CoV.

Human ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 have been found to be compatible.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds more weakly to humans than SARS-CoV-2 which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection among patients than SARS-CoV-2.
SARS-CoV-2 can also produce a modern small protein encoded by ORF.3.B and an extractive protein encoded by ORF8.
SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in the pathogenic potential of the SARS-CoV-3B pathogen, inhibiting the expression of IFNBeta; however, ORF-8 does not have a known functional range or specificity.
On February 18, 2020, Jow and others, in conjunction with amino acid nampry B.0.AT.1., recorded the low-temperature electron microscope structure of the full-length human ACE2 at a separation of 2.9 Å.
The opening and closing outer linkage were combined in two ways and the ACE2-B0.AT1 ACE2-B0AT1 linkage combines the two S proteins that can identify and cause infection of COVID-19.

SARS-CoV) and MERS-CoV) can attack for up to 48 hours in an outdoor dry environment and up to 5 days in an environment of 20 °C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar characteristics.
Sars-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been reported to be excitatory to UV rays and to be 56 °C at 30 minutes; 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, paracidic acid, chlorophore and other fatty solvents activate the pathogen with the edge, but chlorhexidine does not.
The entire human population is immune to SARS-CoV-2 and therefore is susceptible to novel infection.
Currently, there are no reports of any extensive studies being conducted on the anti-cancer effects of SARS-CoV-2.

Generally, if a pathogen is infected on an infected person, it is first identified by the immune system of the infected person through originally identifiable receptors (PRRs), including C-type lectin-like receptors (DLRs), DOL-like receptors (DOLs), NOLs (NOLs), and RIG-like receptors (RLRs).
Exposure to inflammatory factors, maturation of the small cell, synthesis of type 1 inhibitory proteins (IFNs) are stimulated by the pathogen in different ways, which limits the spread of the pathogen and increases the way the pathogen is swallowed and destroyed in the blood cells of pathogenic antibodies.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Soon, the transgenic immunity will join the fight against the antigen.
D-hydroxyl groups, including CD4+ and CD8+ cells, play important roles in the immune system.
CD4+D cells stimulate B-molecules to produce antibodies to the specific pathogen and CD8+D cells directly kill the pathogen-infected cells.
To assist the defensive cells, the T helper cells produce the inflammatory cytokine.

SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2)  The time interval between symptoms is estimated to be 1-14 days, with a minimum duration of 3-7 days, based on a study of 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, in a study of 1,099 infected people, the average time for symptoms was 3 days and it could be anywhere from 0 to 24 days.
One of the most recent studies confirmed that the incidence of symptoms in the population of 8,866 cases, as described above, is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The most important task for health officials is to adjust the time period of effective quarantine based on the time intervals in which symptoms appear, so that people who are infected but do not have symptoms can avoid spreading the virus to others.

Early stage patients will have a normal or reduced number of outer white blood cells (especially, lymphocytes).
For example, 1,099 COVID-19 patients were diagnosed with a cleft lipid with a white blood cell count of less than 4×109/L, including less than 1×109/L, and higher levels of asphatic amino substitution and hypoglycemia in the blood.
Some patients had increased levels of liver and muscle enzymes and muscle tissue in the blood, and most patients had increased C-reactive purity and blood cycloacetate.
In severe cases, the blood clot-lowering agent D-value was high and the blood cell count was low.
Most COVID-19 patients have had abnormal conditions in breast radiology and have had optic conditions such as bilateral patches or glazed glass in the lungs.
Occasionally, patients may experience abnormal pneumonia, severe lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid addition and progressive fibrosis actively compromise gas exchange.
The function of type one and type two neumocytes, which decreases the level of diffusion and increases the density, thereby reducing the capacity of the lung to expand, thus maximizing the risk of lung failure.

14 February 2020  Feng Shang Group describes a procedure for detecting SARS-CoV-2 using CRISPR-based technology, in which the synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA particles were detected in 20 × 10-18 microlitre/litre from 200 × 10-18 microlitre/litre (input 10-100 copies per microlitre) in one hour, without the need for extensive tools.
If confirmed in clinical models, the new technology is believed to be able to rapidly improve sensory abilities and convenience.
Due to the lack of sufficient experience with novel COVID-19, doctors are primarily providing assistive care to COVID-19 patients while trying out different types of treatments previously used or proposed as a treatment for other coronavirus and other pathogens such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. (Table (Table 2) 2).
Antibiotics, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicines and psychological support are currently in place and are potentially beneficial treatments.

Pharmaceutical companies are competing to develop antibodies and vaccines.
SARS-CoV-2 (primarily known as SARS-CoV-2) initially attacks the lungs and may affect other organs such as the endothelial system and kidneys that release ACE2 (see below).

As such, respiratory aid is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives, with general oxygen therapy, high oxygen flow, non-permeable ventilation and permeable mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
️ Patients with severe respiratory disorder should be supported with virtual java biomedical (EQM), a modified cardiopulmonary alternative technology used to treat life-threatening heart attack or respiratory arrest.
In addition, maintenance of the balance of electron transport, prevention and treatment of secondary infection and nutritional shock, and protection of function of key organs are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) patients.
The cytocin cycle is the result of an over-activated immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine Storm is a form of molecular inflammatory boiling that releases a sequence of cytokines including DNA-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-6, IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, IFN-gamma, and MCP-1.
These processors stimulate the immune system to release the high levels of tarmac molecules that are a major cause of ARDS and other organ failure.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Tassilzump, an anti-HIV and IL-6 single-cell disease antagonist, is being used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immunotherapy treatments for cytokine starch include modification of the DNA-driven immune response; IFN-gamma, IL-1 and DNAF inhibitors; JAK suppression, aliphthalmophobia; cytokine signal 4 suppression; and HTAC inhibitors.
Steroids were widely used as immunosuppressants in SARS therapy to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, in SARS and COVID-19 patients, overdose of steroids is not beneficial due to severe lung injury.
In response, they can cause severe side effects, particularly bone tissue damage without blood flow, which can have a profound effect on prognosis.
However, it is recommended that patients with life-threatening COVID-19 receive a short-term, at least medium-term, endocrine system.

The antigen is the antigen that produces B-terminal cells (IG) to fight off disease organisms and other foreign organisms, and that directly identifies and activates unique molecules in disease organisms.
Based on this, blood plasma collected from a group of patients recovering from COVID-19 was injected into 10 patients who were at high risk.
Symptoms improved within 24 hours and the inflammation and the pathogenic load decreased and the blood bio-concentration improved.
However, as specific treatments are not yet developed, confirmation and clarification are needed before the proposed system is widely available.

However, the effects of a formula depend on the combination of different components, which will vary depending on the diagnosis based on the principles of the TCM.
Most of the useful elements are unknown or unclear because such elements or their optimal combinations are difficult to extract and confirm.
Today, as COVID-19 is not curable and has no specific treatment, TCM is the main alternative treatment for patients with moderate to moderate symptoms or those recovering from severe conditions.
Shu Feng Ji Do Capsules and Lian Hua Shing Wen Capsules, for example, have been found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
In China, the recovery rates were high in several provinces, including Kansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hanan (50%) where TCMM was used on 87% of COVID-19 patients.
However, this is a very rough comparison as there are many other influencing factors such as patient count and severity that need to be evaluated.
February 18, 2020, Fake Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing the treatment of Western Medicines (WM) alone and the combined treatment of DCM with WM.
They found that the time required for recovery from body temperature, symptom masking, and hospitalization was shorter for the group given traditional Chinese medicine with Western medicine than for the group taking only Western medicine.

Compulsory contact tracking and isolation, as part of public health measures in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, may further cause people to feel anxious and guilty about the effects of the infection, isolation and the harm they will cause to their family and friends.
Mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, people suspected of having the disease and people in contact with them, and the general public in need.
Mental health groups covering different sectors, including clear exchanges and treatment plans with continuous and accurate updates on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and the use of professional electronic tools and apps to avoid close contact with each other.
Vaccines are needed to help disrupt the chain of transmission from infected animals to humans and to control infections caused by emerging pathogens.

Developing safe and effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 for immunocompromised individuals is an urgent and critical task in the fight against the current outbreak.
However, due to the long time it takes to fertilise the vaccine (on average 18 months) and the variation in the status of the coronavirus, overcoming the difficulty is challenging.

Therefore, it is necessary to develop a disease predictive model for healthcare agencies to prioritize their services, especially in resource-poor areas.
Based on clinical studies to date, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age is the most important factor in predicting SARS recovery, and it is true for COVID-19.
As described above, in a study of 8,866 infected people, COVID-19 mainly affected 47.7% of those aged 30-65 years of age over 50.
Patients who needed intensive care already had both illnesses and problems, and they were significantly older than those who did not need such treatment (median age 66 versus 51), suggesting that age is a factor in making a cure-all prognosis for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: As described above, SARS-CoV-2 is more common in males (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000) than in females.
Diseases and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care may be affected by acute coronary heart disease and hypertension.
Heart attacks are the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is reported to bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes and thus cause liver disease in COVID-19 patients.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Extraordinary laboratory findings: Tissue damage or severity in tissue soda is reflected by the level of c-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood and is proposed as a predictor of disease, response to treatment and ultimate cure.
Proposed link between CRP level and COVID-19 severity and recovery estimates.
In addition, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LHT), asphate amino substituent (AST), alanine amino substituent (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) can help predict results.
These enzymes are highly expressed in various organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released when tissue is damaged.

Key Clinical Symptoms: Temporary improvement in chest radiology and clinical symptoms, impacts and complications of COVID-19 should be considered alongside other problems of prognosis.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are anti-inflammatory agents commonly used as adjunctive therapy to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage during infectious diseases.
Since the widespread use of high doses of the prostate on severe SARS patients, many survivors have suffered from complete disability and poor quality of life with the destruction of blood-soaked bone tissue.

Depression: As described above, many patients experience unusual depression during the COVID-19 outbreak due to reasons such as prolonged isolation and extreme uncertainty and witnessing the death of close family members and fellow patients.

In the hope of preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, significant efforts have been made, including a public lockdown and quarantine of almost the entire population in Wuhan and surrounding cities.
Despite the fact that these activities have caused severe damage to the country's economy and other sectors, the number of new cases is declining, indicating that the outbreak is limited.
The most promising estimate is that the outbreak will end in March and the period of decline will last for 3-4 months.

Paul Hunter and others estimated that COVID-19, which is more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Langini and others have set up a model to predict the effects of measles and suggest that two-thirds of the world's population will be infected with SARS-CoV-2.
The newly discovered pathogen may be circulating in a manner similar to the common cold, a fact that is indicated by a team from Canada that SARS-CoV-2 was found in the mid-cornea and throat cortex of patients who had recovered from the disease and left the hospital two weeks earlier.

Recent study of 138 infected people found that 41% of patients, including 17 patients with preexisting conditions and 40 healthcare providers, could have contracted the disease through hospital disinfection.
Therefore, significant steps should be taken to protect humans, especially healthcare providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and patients and even those who are on the side of the infected people.
The first line of defense to reduce the risk of infection is to wear face masks; use of surgical masks and N.95 respiratory masks (line # 1860S) to help control the spread of the virus.

N95 (Section # 1860S) masks only provide protection against small adult pathogens at 10 to 80 mm in size, and only 5% of adult pathogens are fully penetrative; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV-2 at approximately 85 mm.
As the particles travel along the five surgical masks stacked together, healthcare providers in direct contact with patients should wear N-95 (sequence # 1860S) masks rather than surgical masks.
Even with masks, healthcare providers should wear appropriate isolation gauntlets to further reduce contact with the pathogen

COVID-19 affects older people more than younger individuals, and more men than women, and has a higher severity and mortality rate among younger people than among older people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% vs. 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients can spread the virus without symptoms, while SARS patients can only spread the virus if they are seriously ill, making it harder to control the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.

Before 2003, two human coronavirus viruses (HCoVs) were known to cause moderate illness such as the common cold.
The severe sudden onset of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS-MERS) has revealed how devastating and life-threatening human coronavirus infection is.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has re-attracted attention to the coronavirus and its high transmission but at the same time it surprised us that it is less contagious compared to its sister SARS-CoV.

Most human coronaviruses originate from the mouths of the whales, which do not cause disease.

Identification of animal wolves (host) has direct effects on disease prevention in humans.
Studiing the interactions of the coronavirus in animals could provide important insights into human coronavirus infectiousness.
In this review, we present an overview of the current knowledge of seven human coronavirus (HCoVs) focusing on the history of their discovery and their animal origin and interspecies transmission.
Essentially, we're comparing different human coronaviruses (HCoVs) from the perspective of the evolution of the virus and genetic reintegration.
The current coronavirus pandemic 2019 (COVID-19) is discussed in this thread.
In addition, the requirements for successful variants of the umbilicus and the effects of pathogen evolution on disease severity are pointed out.
The coronaviruses belong to the family of coronaviruses, which includes a group of freezing, positive-energy, single-stranded RNA (RNA) pathogens.
Coronaviruses were named for their crown-like shape, which can be seen in electron microscopy.
Structurally speaking, the coronaviruses have undivided lineages that share a similar structure.
In the genome, approximately two thirds contain two or more large, interacting transcriptional systems (overlapping open reading frames (ORF1A, and ORF1B)) which are converted into replication transcripts, called BB1A and BB1A.
These multivariate proteins, known as NSP1-16 are further processed to make 16 non-structural proteins.
The rest of the gene contains ORFs for structural proteins including pin (S), membrane (E), membrane (M) and nucleoproteins (N).
Each gene's unique subprotein is encoded by a different genome of the coronavirus.
Based on protein sequence differentiation, coronaviruses are classified into four (alpha-coronavirus, beta-coronavirus, gamma-coronavirus and delta-coronavirus), which contain the majority of human coronaviruses in beta-coronavirus strains, and are divided into four genetic pathways (A, B, C, and D).
Biogenetic evidence shows that bats and rodents act as the genetic source of most alpha-coronavirus and beta-coronavirus, while birds are the primary source of gamma-coronavirus and delta-coronavirus.

HCoV-229E and HCoV-63 are alpha-corona viruses.
The other five beta-corona pathogens include human coronary disease virus-OC43 (HCoV-OC43), human coronary disease virus-HKU1 ((HCoV-HKU1), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
Human coronavirus virus-229E (HCoV-229E), human coronavirus virus-OC43 (HCoV-OC43), human coronavirus virus-HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) and human coronavirus virus-NL63 (HCoV-NL63) commonly cause moderate symptoms such as colds and/or diarrhea.
Conversely, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly contagious, leading to severe lower respiratory tract infections, which are relatively more common in patients with severe respiratory tract disease (ARDS) and patients with non-pulmonary symptoms.
The first human coronavirus-229E (HCoV-229E) strain, B814, was extracted from the nasal discharge of cold patients in the mid-1960s.
Since then, extensive studies have collected more information on human coronavirus -229E (HCoV-229E) and human coronavirus -OC43 (HCoV-OC43), both of which cause self-control symptoms.
In fact, until the SARS outbreak, the idea was widely accepted that human coronavirus infections were generally harmless.
The 2003 SARS outbreak was one of the most devastating in current history, affecting more than 8,000 people and claiming the lives of about 10% of the population.
Ten years later, a series of outbreaks of the Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) spread to the Arabian Peninsula, and it spread to the rest of the world.
2019 novel human coronavirus virus (2019-nCoV), which was renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the agent of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic 2019 (COVID-19), which has killed more than 3,120 people and infected 91,000 as of March 3, 2020.
Alarm is sounding, and the world needs to be prepared for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The seven human coronavirus (HCoVs) are primarily of animal origin, either from the owl, mouse or domestic animals.
Various evidence supports the evolution of all human coronavirus (HCoV) strains from strains, in which the strains are well adapted and infectious but exhibit extensive genetic differentiation.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world.
The discovery of the animal origin of human coronavirus (HCoV) provides a framework for understanding natural history, propulsion and the factors that control the spread between species.
This could lead or facilitate the search for the host, intermediate and breeding animal host of SARS-CoV-2, with significant implications for preventing future outbreaks.
In this review, we present an overview of the animal origin of human coronaviruses, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common theme that the parent pathogens of human coronavirus (HCoV) are generally non-infectious in their natural host strains, but become infectious in new strains after interspecies spread.
We are also reviewing the evolutionary trend of human coronavirus (HCoV) in which infection rates decrease with increased spread.
The impact of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is being discussed in this context.

Over the past decades, seven human coronavirus (HCoV) strains have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discovery of the human coronavirus in chronological order (Table 1) will be descriptive and informative.
The first human coronavirus strain -229E (HCoV-229E) was extracted from the respiratory tract of upper respiratory tract infections patients in 1966 and subsequently adapted to grow in WI-38 lung cell lines.

Later in 1967, the human coronavirus pathogen-OC43 (HCoV-OC43) was extracted from the embryo and the tracts in the brain of mice.
The infectious medical features of human coronavirus -OC43 (HCoV-OC43) are similar to those of human coronavirus -229E (HCoV-229E), which are indissociable from infection by symptoms with other respiratory tract pathogens such as influenza A and rhinitis.
Human coronavirus virus-229E (HCoV-229E) and human coronavirus virus-OC43 (HCoV-OC43) are both globally spread, and they are spread in the winter in temperate climates.
Generally speaking, for these two pathogens, the incidence of symptoms is less than one week, followed by a period of about two weeks.
A study with human volunteers found that healthy people infected with human coronavirus strain -229E (HCoV-229E) developed moderately normal saliva.
Only a few immunocompromised patients were diagnosed with severe lower respiratory infections.

SARS-CoV infection is initially characterized by muscle soreness, headache, fever, nausea and colds, followed by respiratory distress, cough and respiratory distress.
Lymphonia, impaired liver function tests, and high levels of creatine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities of sarcasm.
Sars patients have seen widespread lung cell damage, epithelial cell proliferation and increased macrophages.

In addition to the lower respiratory tract, many organs, including the esophagus, liver, and kidney, may also be affected by these severe infections, usually accompanied by a cytokine cycle, which can be particularly dangerous for immunocompromised patients.

Since then, the largest efforts have been devoted to research into human coronaviruses.
Human coronavirus - NL63 (HCoV-NL63) was extracted from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004.

The most common causes of human coronavirus - NL63 (HCoV-NL63) are coronary artery disease, esophageal arthritis, fever and pneumonia.
Another independent study described the same pathogen being extracted from a nasal sample of an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.

Human Coronavirus - NL63 (HCoV-NL63) is also known as spinal cord inhibition vocal tract inflammation.
The same year, human coronavirus strain-HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) was extracted from a 71-year-old man admitted to hospital with pneumonia and pneumonia in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and pneumonia, human coronavirus strain -HCoV-HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) is thought to be associated with severe asthma exacerbations.
HCoV-HKU1 was found worldwide, as were HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, thus causing mild respiratory illnesses.
The four communities that have received the human coronavirus (HCoV) are well adapted to humans, and are generally less likely to cause aggressive infectious diseases, although accidents occur for unknown reasons. Like the rare occurrence of the more severe subtype of human coronavirus -NL63 (HCoV-NL63), these have recently been reported to cause severe endothelial infection in China.
Generally speaking, these human coronavirus (HCoVs) become less severe or contagious as they gain the ability to spread effectively and maintain their presence in humans.

Unlike SARS, many patients affected by MERS also had severe renal failure, which is so far unique to MERS among human-caused diseases.
Over 30% of patients with gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratories have reported confirmed infections with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive pathogens known to humans.
During the period from mid-December to late December 2019, a large number of pneumonia patients were identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, who were known to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the SARS-CoV-2 sub-coronavirus epidemic as an international public health emergency and has designated the disease as COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, there have been 90,053 confirmed cases globally, with a serious infection mortality of 3.4%.

Neumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly lead to severe respiratory syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to their 82% high nucleotide sequence homology, they cluster into different branches in the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 has a lower infectiousness but is more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.

SARS-CoV-2 when compared to six other human coronaviruses, reveals similarities and differences between them.
First, the time interval between symptoms and the duration of human coronary disease are the same.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 follows the same course as the other six human coronaviruses.
Secondly, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
SARS-CoV-2 infection, on the other hand, reveals features commonly seen during human-CoV infections that have spread to the community, including significantly low, moderate or no symptoms.

Thirdly, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 shows the characteristics of both the human coronavirus (HCoV) and SARS-CoV that have been received by the community.
On the one hand, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is lower than that of community-acquired HCoVs.
On the other hand, it is necessary to check whether the spread of SARS-CoV-2 from humans is gradually decreasing, as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, just like other human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.

HCoVs that cause severe disease in humans and those that have developed severe HCoVs have been removed.
To achieve this, human coronavirus (HCoV) must be replicated in humans to allow adaptation genetic mutations to accumulate that resist the homologous control factors.

If it changes itself to the situation, it will be difficult to stop the spread of infection to humans through isolation or other infection control measures.
Over the years, the four coronaviruses that society has received have spread to the human population, triggering a normal outbreak in immunocompromised humans.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Conversely, highly virulent pathogens, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, are not well adapted to humans and therefore cannot spread to humans.
They must survive and reproduce in their animal pathways and have the opportunity to travel to vulnerable human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate and multiplying hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has similarities to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four human coronavirus (HCoV) in the community.

However, it is more contagious than community-acquired human coronavirus and less contagious than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.

If an animal has a closely related ancestor that shares high similarity at the level of the nucleotide sequence, an animal acts as the evolutionary host of an HCoV
The ancestor virus is usually adapted to the host and is free of pathogens.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
In both cases, the parasites are naturally infected and are either the natural parasites of the human coronavirus or its parent parasite.
Conversely, if an HCV is introduced to humans before or around the introduction of a new intermediate host, it will not fit well with the new host and will often cause disease.
The intermediate host can act as a zoonotic source of human infection and can play the role of a multiplier host by allowing the virus to replicate continuously, then transmitting it to humans to multiply the human infection rate.
HCoV virus, if it cannot sustain its spread in the intermediate host, will expose itself to end-stage infection.
Conversely, HCoVs can mutate with an intermediate host and can also develop a long-term infection.
In this, the intermediate umbilicus becomes a natural herniated umbilicus.
The first known epidemic of SARS has a history of contact with sports animals.
In a subsequent epidemiological study, animal traders were shown to have higher SARS-CoV immunity proteins than the general population.

The search for SARS-CoV-2's natural animal umbilicus has revealed a closely related SARS-related rhinoplasty virus known as SARS-RRH-CoV-3 (SARS-CoV-2), which is found in Chinese equine veins.
These spores are positive for SARS-CoV antibodies and the gene sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
These studies have laid the foundation for a new view that the emerging human pathogens are the parasites.
Several coronaviruses (SL-CoVs) such as SARS have been identified from the spores, but nothing but a unique WIV1 can be extracted as a living pathogen.
Human angiodensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as a receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1, derived from a molecule model of the larvae, has been shown to be able to use the larvae, the civet (a cat) and human ACE2 as receptors for cell entry.
Interestingly, the serum of patients with chronic SARS has the ability to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 has been the closest ancestor of SARS-CoV in the WIV1 strain, which shares a 95% saturated acid sequence similarity.
Despite the high similarity between the two pathogens, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parent pathogen of SARS-CoV, and that the larvae are not the immediate host of SARS-CoV.
Genetic analysis groups suggest that the MERS-CoV virus is equivalent to a single group, the WAVAL CoV-HKU4 and the BAT CoV-HKU5.
The WAVAL coronavirus virus -HQ4 and MERS-CoV - use the single-celled receptor, the peptide peptide 4 (DPP4) to enter the virus.
Whoa, which is a member of the Whoa, which is a beta-corona virus identified from Europe and Africa, is genetically closely related to the RNA-based RNA polymerase sequences of the MERS-CoV.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
MERS-CoV and its close relative, the Vauxhall coronavirus-HKU25, share only 87% sequence similarity.
Therefore, the larvae may not be an immediate stopover for MERS-CoV.
Research in the Middle East, on the other hand, shows that camels are, like camels of Middle Eastern descent in many African countries, photopoeetic to neutralizing immunizations specific to MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV, a living MERS-CoV that is similar to that found in humans, is isolated from the camel's nose, indicating that camels serve as the true host host of MERS-CoV.

The infected camels not only spread the pathogen through the respiratory tract but also through the gastrointestinal tract, which is the main route of pathogen transmission in the larvae.
However, since many confirmed pathogenic effects of MERS do not have a history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, it is presumed that there are unknown ways of transmission involving human-to-human transmission or unauthorized animal species that contain MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Just like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RADG13 is excellent enough to cause a parent relationship.

A number of recent studies based on the genetic summation of mutations have suggested that a group of dangerous small mammals known as anthocytes (Manus Giovannica) may also contain ancestral beta-corona viruses related to SARS-CoV-2.
The novel notes that ant-coronavirus genes share 85-92% saturated acid sequence makeup with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are closely related to RADG13 with a 90% mark in the saturated acid sequence.
They belong to two subgenotypes of pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 in the genome tree, one of which shares a highly similar receptor-binding domain (RBD) with 97.4% amino acid sequence identity with SARS-CoV-2.
Conversely, the RBD (RBD) genes of SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 are very different, although they are of a higher order of similarity.
Previous study of infected ants has reported detection of pathogenic contigens from lung samples, associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The study followed different sequencing methods and genome sequencing to form a partial sequence that comprised approximately 86.3% of the full-length pathogenic gene.

However, currently there is no evidence to support the direct ant-like origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to the sequence difference between the beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2 and ant-CoV-2 related to ant-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RADG13 is less than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 of the ant.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 is to be established in bats, ants and other mammals.
The highest sequence similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and ant has been found in RPDs, with SARS-CoV-2-related beta-corona viruses, SARS-CoV-2 and RADG13 sharing the highest genetic sequence similarity.

There is a counter-system for reintegration between SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoV and RaTG13, a third wildlife species of ant.
The phenomenon of beta-corona relapses is widespread as a driving force in evolution.
The mediator has not yet been included in the immediate animal transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to the highly aggressive human coronavirus, the animal-borne origin of human coronavirus -229E (HCoV-229E), human coronavirus -OC43 (HCoV-OC43), human coronavirus -NL63 (HCoV-NL63) and human coronavirus -HZK1 (HCoV-HKU1) has also been studied.
Genetic evidence indicates that both human coronavirus -NL63 (HCoV-NL63) and human coronavirus -229E (HCoV-229E) may have originated from the Wuval coronavirus, while the parent viruses of human coronavirus -OC43 and human coronavirus -Heskey1 (HCoV-HKU1) have been found in ruminants.
Appalachian Ridge Coronavirus.2 - A virus known as Appalachian Ridge Coronavirus.2 - has been reported to be closely related to human coronavirus-NL63 (HCoV-NL63).
Human coronavirus-229E (HCoV-229E), on the other hand, is genetically related to another Wu-Wall coronavirus known as Hippocytosis/Kanakwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, while camels are suspected to be its intermediate omnivore.
For clarity, the current details on the animal origin of known human coronavirus (HCoV) are summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Ethnological analysis has provided evidence for the interspecies transmission of human coronaviruses throughout history.
When human coronary disease virus -OC43 (HCoV-OC43) passed through strains of humans from domestic animals in 1890, an outbreak of respiratory infection was recorded.
The interspecies transmission history of human coronavirus-229E (HCoV-229E) is unclear.

Many sources prove that the virus can be transmitted directly from the mouth to the human body.
First, it's not the alpacas that humans can communicate with the Wawales in a shared environment.

Alternatively, bat alpha-CoVs act as gene banks of HCoV-229E, while alpacas and trometry camels may act as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, much like MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is a prime example of the spread of the virus from bats to monkey camels and from monkey camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats has been known since it was first identified and has been reinforced by subsequent discoveries.

Longevity, dense groups, close social interaction and strong ability to fly are favorable conditions for the larvae to be a good 'pathogen'.
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has been introduced to camels in isolation for decades.
The virus has adapted well to camels, transforming camels from an intermediate host to a stable and natural host for hunting.

Analysis of domestic and wild animals for other species is required.
Third, as mentioned above, the susceptibility and adaptability of SARS-CoV-2 may have evolved in a third species that has been associated with bats and ants.
The search for the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
Apart from the host species, there are three major factors in the pathogenic side that help the coronavirus to overcome the barriers to breeding.
First, their relatively high rates of genetic mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-isolated RNA viruses, the estimated variability rates of CoVs can be considered to be "moderate" to "higher", with the average conversion rate varying approximately 10 to 4 per year per year on the platform, which may vary to novel hosts depending on the stage of CoV.

In theory, the genes, vaccines and pathogenic vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 would be ineffective.
Secondly, the large RNA in the CoVs imposes additional plasticity on genetic mutation for rearrangement and rearrangement, thereby increasing the probability of co-evolution of gaps, which is favorable for the emergence of novel CoVs when conditions are appropriate.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Third, the coronavirus randomly and frequently replace the precursors during RNA response through a unique copy-selection technique.
In a host that acts as a mixer, a string shift occurs frequently during COV RNA transcription.
Highly synchronous full-length and subgenetic RNAs (RNAs) may regenerate to form new coronaviruses.
Ethnological evidence of natural regrowth is found in both human coronary disease virus-HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) and human coronary disease virus-OC43 (HCoV-OC43), as well as animal coronary disease virus-such as SARS-CoV-2 and BatCoV-HKU-9 (batCoV-HKU9).
The disease-viral interaction with the spread
In addition to the above three pathogen factors, the pathogenic interaction with the umbilical receptor is another important factor influencing interspecies transmission.
Here, the resurgence of SARS-CoV is considered a notable example, revealing evidence for positive screening during interspecies transmission events.
Based on a comparative analysis of SARS-CoV isolations of human and germ cat, it is assumed that SARS-CoV may be subjected to rapid adaptation in different hosts, especially with mutations in the RBD of S protein.

In SARS-CoV, RPD is a protein that in S1 is composed of 318 to 510 amino acids, which bind to human ACE2 and its core receptors for pathogen entry.
The RBD of SARS-CoV has the ability to detect the ACE2 receptors of various animals including the wolf, the ferret, the mouse and the raccoon, thus enabling the transmission of the virus between species.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues have been found to differ from human and Civet pathogen extracts in RPD, of which 4 have the receptor-binding property of interacting with the ACE2 receptor.
Civet SARS-CoV has mutations K479N and S487T in its RBD, which may increase the association of spike protein interactions with the human ACE2 receptor.

30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV suggests that the S protein's binding relationship to the human ACE2 on the S protein's S1 molecule may have changed.
In fact, a CREO-EM study suggests that there is 10 to 20 times more correlation in this binding than between human ACE2 (ACE2) and SARS-CoV S proteins.

There are many human coronary receptor, such as aminopeptidase N for human coronary disease virus-229E (HCoV-229E) and 9-o-acetylsalicylic acid for human coronary disease virus-OC43 (HCoV-OC43).
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these CoVs to humans after the animal transmission of their animal hosts.
The effect of human coronavirus (HCoV) on the transmission of human coronary receptors is governed by other pro- and control factors.
The difference in these carcinogenic proteins between humans and the natural hominids of the human coronavirus (HCoV), such as the wolves, single-tailed camels and rodents, may be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
Human coronavirus (HCoV) needs to capture pro-animal factors and reduce pro-animal control factors for successful interspecies transmission.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this critical area of pathogen-object interactions will be identified and classified.
CRISPR will benefit from a neutral genetic scale test for probiotic dependence and control factors for SARS-CoV-2 using state-of-the-art technology.
Novel Human Coronavirus (HCoV) Exposure: Back to the beginning
The novel The Diversity of the Coronavirus provides a wealth of opportunities for the development of human coronavirus (HCoV).
In this case, the valve covs act as the gene bank of the HCoVs.
In addition, rapid genetic mutation and genetic fusion are driving the evolution of the human coronavirus (HCoV), and this function serves as two critical stages.
For example, the acquisition or loss of novel protein-coding genes has the potential to drastically alter pathogenic appearances.
Of the SARS-CoV subprotein, it is thought that the main factor is the human-appropriate mutation of ORF8 because the SARS-CoV-related oral pathogens encode different ORF8 proteins even when extracted.
Stream isolated at the beginning of human epidemic has been identified as a 29-nucleotide-decomposing trait of SARS-CoVs.

In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, there have been cases of human coronavirus (HCoV) relapses in other human coronavirus (HCoVs) in which human coronavirus (HCoV) has been linked to other animal coronavirus (CoVs) with their non-structural genes.

An example of these effects is the loss of full-length ORF4 in human coronary artery disease strains (HCoV-229E) due to the elimination of two saturated acids.
Since non-infectious ORF4 is found in bovine and camel pathogens associated with human coronavirus-229E (HCoV-229E), alpha-corona alpha-pathogen shows single-seated acid insertion, resulting in a transcription.
Lastly, the evolution of novel human coronavirus (HCoV) is driven by selective pressure in their host host host.
When the testicles were infected with the coronavirus, there were no symptoms or moderate symptoms, indicating a correspondence between the coronavirus and the testicles.

Here are the secrets to why there are no symptoms and what causes severe infections in human infection.
Severe symptoms are primarily caused by the stimulation of an immune response and cytokine cycling, in which if the immune response is strong, the lung damage is more severe.
Conversely, in non-symptomatic immunosuppressants, the immune response has been removed from the coronavirus response.
The same trick to eliminate an immune response may be beneficial in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
The antigenic response is particularly strong in the ovaries.
Injection of type I interferon in humans during the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection is therefore beneficial.
In addition, the inflammatory activation of the larvae is impaired.
In this logic, it was known that blocking NLRP3 inflorescence with MCC950 (MCC950) was effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The origin of SARS-CoV-2 follows a common theme that emerged from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although Beta-Cov has 95% nucleotide homology sharing with SARS-CoV, there is also a 96% nucleotide homology sharing with SARS-CoV-2

Ants have been identified with beta-corona pathogens similar to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that ants may act as one of the intermediate host organisms or that fragments of ants may contribute to the final version of the SARS-CoV-2 gene.
While questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately or accidentally created by humans.

The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has greatly changed our perception of the animal origin in human transmission and the importance of animal clutches of human coronaviruses (HCoVs).
There is widespread evidence that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated from Vaughlin and are transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
If SARS-CoV infection arises from interactions between humans and marketed pathogens, it can effectively end the SARS epidemic by closing poultry markets and killing pathogens.
Considering the discovery of multiple strains of ant beta-corona pathogens closely related to SARS-CoV-2, for the same reason, ants should be removed from meat markets to prevent animal transmission.
However, future studies will clarify how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through ants and other mammals.
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has been isolated from camels for decades.
The camels are an important means of transportation and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the local people.
They are widespread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
As in wildlife markets in China, it is not possible to sacrifice all camels to control the disease, as in the case of wildlife markets in China, to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent the continued spread of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be developed to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels, in conjunction with other infection control measures.

There is a high probability that these animal-borne coronaviruses will evolve and regroup, resulting in the emergence of new coronaviruses that will be highly transmissible and/or potentially dangerous to humans in the future.
To reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, the wildlife-eating culture in some parts of China must be abandoned.

They will remain in their own natural habitats until they have the chance to spread.
Although whales have many positive aspects for spreading pathogens, knowledge of them can reduce the chances of contact with whales and other wildlife species.
Continuous monitoring in mammals is necessary to better understand the environment of coronaviruses and their natural hosts, which will be effective in preventing transmission from animals to humans and future infections.

The origin of the SARS-CoV-2 strain of the virus is still unknown.
First, if bats spread the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen to ants, they will be curious to see under what circumstances bats and ants share the same environmental importance.
Secondly, if fleas play a more direct role in human transmission, we need to figure out how humans interact with fleas.
Third, if a third mammal is to act as a true intermediate reptile, it should clarify how it interacts with different organisms including humans, termites and ants.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be exposed to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and testing infection should be conducted.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Covid-19 Casual Doubt and Confirmed Case Diagnostic criteria need to be updated

(COVID-19) 2019 is a new disease, and it is also worth noting that our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing through the current research and clinical experience, and therefore, strategies and treatments for detecting infection are also being continuously updated.
In this letter, we have responded to a comment from our guideline and have released new diagnostic schemes for suspected cases and confirmed cases as per the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh edition) issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) began to spread, which is now officially named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and is also known as SARS-CoV-2 (Sexy Respiratory Syndrome 2).
World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the COVID-19 pandemic as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 Our team has developed a Quick Guidance Guide to combating SARS-CoV-2 and it has been published on the website of the Military Medical Review on 06 February 2020.

Their work has added new evidence to our guidance and has provided the best data for the whole world to know about the pandemic.
We acknowledge and thank them for their remarkable work.
However, their work needs to be updated in line with the latest diagnostic and treatment techniques (Veloda VII) and latest studies for COVID-19.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to ensure that infection occurs, infection factors must combine with either two subjects of clinical exposure to conduct an all-consuming analysis, or, in the absence of a clear epidemiological history, it must satisfy three subjects of clinical exposure.
History of infection: (1) travelling or living in Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 was reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) (resident acid test positive) contact with SARS-CoV-2 infection; (3) visiting Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 was reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (4) contacting patients with flu and respiratory problems from other communities who had been infected with infections and/or symptoms of COVID-19 in small areas such as the office, the office, the school, and/or the classroom; and (2) contacting patients with infections and/or symptoms of COVID-19 in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms.
Clinical manifestations: (1) symptoms of fever and/or respiratory disorder; (2) symptoms of COVID-19 infection; (3) overall white blood cell count at the onset of spread is normal, low, or decreased.
Identification of confirmed case should be based on the suspicious case with any pathogen or serological evidence as follows: (1) real-time PCR test positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) full viral genome sequence showing greater integrity to known novel coronavirus; (3) serum test positive for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM antibody and IgG antibody; or positive transition of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibody from negative to ≥4 times in the recovery phase or severe phase.
Real-time PCR testing for the presence of saturated acid in the respiratory tract or blood samples can be seen in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) versions.
The fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions on pathogenesis in blood samples; subsequent nutritional evidence has been added in the seventh edition.
These changes based on the researchers continued the work of finding the optimal nucleic acid detection tool for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples taken from the respiratory tract, including blood samples, which increased the availability of different samples, and supported bringing a specific antibody positive outcome on confirmed criteria.

"Therefore, it is necessary to update the curriculum of Sue and others who classify as ""low risk"" people without clinical symptoms".
Clinical procedures and studies should be checked.
Conclusion
"We recommend that patients who are suspected of being ill and confirmed to be ill be tested and that they find and follow new guidelines in their home countries".
Our team will update our guidelines for providing assistance from time to time.

He expects production costs to rise as suppliers try to meet demand, as critical raw materials are scarce.

Although the term "pandemic" refers to how widespread a disease is, not how dangerous specific diseases are, the World Health Organization (WHO) stresses the need for governments to intervene:"
"All countries can change the course of the pandemic now".
"Countries must find, test, treat, isolate, identify and unite their populations", said Dr. Tetros Adhanom Gabrayez, Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO).
"The spread and its extreme nature are of high concern and the lack of action against it is of high concern".
"According to Dr. Tom Freedon, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is ""unprecedented"".
In a February CNN note, he said, ""No other respiratory pathogens have been monitored from the onset of the virus to the international outbreak, except for the common cold"."
"Gabreus expressed a similar view, ""we have never seen a pandemic triggered by a coronavirus before"."
He said, "We've never seen an epidemic that can be controlled at the same time".
Following the World Health Organization's decision in January to declare the outbreak of the disease a public health emergency of international concern, it was given a new status as a plague disease.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the US National Director of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak, ""Basically, it's going to get worse"".
As of Thursday, the total number of COVID-19 cases worldwide was 126,000 and 4,600 deaths, the Associated Press reported.
201920 Coronavirus Disease is the coronavirus pandemic 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the currently infected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

26 Feb. As of that date, relatively few young patients had been reported, with only 2.4% of those worldwide aged 19 and under. Patrick Vellance, chief science adviser to the UK, estimates that 60% of the UK population would have to be infected before effective herd immunity is achieved.
These represent the number of people tested for COVID-19 and those tests have been confirmed in accordance with official protocols.
As of March 23, no country has ever tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland have official policies against testing those with moderate symptoms.
A study published on March 16 found that 86% of COVID-19 infections in China as of January 23 were undetected and that these undetected infections spread the disease to 79% of confirmed cases.
Statistical analysis published on 30 March estimates that there may be significantly more cases in Italy than explicitly reported.
The initial level estimates of the baseline reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that it may be 5.7.

"A spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that ""we know that [the death toll] has been underestimated"", a statement confirmed by a small number of specification reports in the United States. Such a decline occurs most often during epidemics, including the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on 9 January 2020".
The first death outside mainland China was in the Philippines on February 1, and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14.

The numbers vary over time depending on the region, and they vary by the extent to which they are tested, the quality of the health system, treatment options, demographic characteristics such as the onset of the disease to the present time, age, gender, and overall health. The number of patients and the mortality rate, the number of deaths, is classified by the number of patients diagnosed at a given time interval.

The number varies by region.
In China, the estimates of the ratio of patients to deaths decreased from 17.3% (1-10 January 2020 among those with symptoms) to 0.7% (1 after February 2020 with symptoms). Other measures include the patient mortality rate (CFR-CFR), which reflects the percentage of confirmed infectious deaths from a disease, and the infectious mortality rate (IFR-IFR), which reflects the percentage of those who have the disease (infected and undiagnosed).

Only a few reports have been lab-confirmed as as asymptomatic infections, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during contact tracking investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although there is no clear information on how the disease spreads, we do know that one can usually spread the infection to two to three people.

Although there is no evidence that animals can transmit the pathogen to humans, British authorities advise washing one's hands after contact with animals as if infected persons may have touched them after contact with other surfaces.
Extreme acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS COVID-2) is a novel pathogen that was originally isolated from a group of pneumonia-affected people in Wuhan who were associated with severe respiratory illness.
All characteristics of novel SARS-CoV-2 occur naturally in related coronaviruses. The virus is killed by household soap as it dissolves its protective membranes outside the human body.

In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there was only one amino acid difference in specific parts of the gene sequence between pathogens derived from ant species and pathogens that have spread to humans.
The 92% similarity in genetic material shared between the total ant count and SARS-CoV-2 to date is not sufficient to prove ant count as an intermediate host.

A study in Wuhan compared PCR to CT suggested that while many of the graphic features of CT overlapped with other pneumonia and disease processes, CT could show significantly more definite effects than PCR.
"As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that the CT (CT) system should not be used as a first-stage test or screening test for COVID-19 diagnosis".
The World Health Organization (WHO) has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on January 17.
Test resistance copying uses multi-step enzyme sequencing (RRT-PCR) in real time.
Tests can be performed on breathing or blood samples.
Results are usually available in a few hours to a few days.
Although the thoracic cortex can also be used, it is usually performed on the nasal part of the nose.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these have been confirmed to be accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
Selex optical testing system is approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories in the United States.
The characteristic graphic features of X-rays and radiographic sketches (CTs) on people with symptoms include asymmetrical surface glass optical positions and non-blind fluids.
The Italian Radiological Association is developing an international Internet database of standard draft findings for infected individuals.
Drafting without PCR confirmation, combined with other infections such as adenovirus, has a special feature in identifying COVID-19.
Although chest CT results are less likely to be accurate in identifying infection by the draft method compared to PCR, a large-scale study in China has shown that it is quick and clear to show the effects immediately.

71% ethanol, 50100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2-7.5% bovidone-iodine can be used to purify surfaces (within a minute of disinfection on the steel surface).
Other solvents such as benzodiazepine chloride and chlorohexidine gluconate are less effective.
CEDC recommends that in areas where COVID-19 is suspected to have occurred, or where the infected have been present, such as an office or day care center, the office area, toilets, public areas used by the infected persons should be used.
Healthcare providers recommend that people bend their knees or cover their mouths and noses with tissue during coughing or sneezing and that any tissue be removed immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for people with infections because wearing a mask will control the amount of fluid and distance travelled when breathing, when talking, when humming and when digging.

The maximum recommended by U.S. government agencies and health agencies was reduced from 250 (if no COVID-19 spread is known in a region) to 50 and then to 10.
"On March 22, 2020, Germany banned the presence of more than two people in public places. The CDC instructs the elderly and those with long-term health problems, including diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, high blood pressure and low immunity, to remain indoors as much as possible in areas with social disorder. In late March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the health organizations began using a "physical rule" in response to such a system, which called for "disconnection", to make sure that the physical or remote communication was kept in the same physical environment.
"The use of the phrase ""social distancing"" has led to the idea that people should be completely isolated from society rather than encouraging interaction with each other in alternative ways. Some authorities have even published sexual health guidelines to be used during the spread of the plague".

Health agencies have provided extensive guidance on self-isolation. Many governments have mandated or recommended self-isolation for the entire population living in affected areas.
Strong self-isolation instructions are given to groups at high risk of spread.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Control or suppression and mitigation are strategies for controlling disease effects.
Control measures are being taken in the early stages of the outbreak, with the aim of identifying and isolating those infected, and introducing vaccines to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to control the spread of the disease, efforts are moving to a post-concentration phase: measures are being taken to reduce the spread and mitigate its effects on the health system and society
Prevention and mitigation can be carried out simultaneously.

It reduces the risk of over-management by health services and provides more time for vaccine and treatment development.
Non-drug barriers that can manage the spread include personal prevention measures such as hand sanitization, wearing a mask and self-isolation; social distancing measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling public gatherings; social engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such barriers; as well as environmental measures such as surface cleaning. Several stringent measures aimed at curbing the spread, such as the isolation of entire cities and imposition of strict travel restrictions, were carried out in China while the severity of the spread was clearly known.
Other countries have taken various measures to control the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced massive testing and localized quarantine, and issued alerts on the movement of infected individuals.
Singapore has imposed financial assistance to those affected and isolated and a heavy fine for those who fail to do so.
Taiwan has also imposed a fine for smuggling medical products that increase mask production. Simulations for Great Britain and the United States show major challenges in mitigation (preventing but not stopping the spread of the virus) and suppression (reversing the development of the virus).
Better prevention policies can reduce the need for top healthcare by two-thirds and deaths by half, but they can also result in tens of thousands of deaths and a collapse of health systems.

The long-term interference in the fight against the pandemic has been causing social and economic costs.
️There is no specific antibacterial vaccine against COVID-19, but efforts are underway to develop it, including testing of existing drugs.
Take medicines for cold, drink fluids, and rest may help to limit symptoms.
Depending on the severity, bioremediation, neural fluids and respiratory support may be required.
️Steroid use can worsen the effects.
A number of compounds previously approved for the treatment of other pathogenic diseases are being studied for the treatment of COVID-19.
"The World Health Organization (WHO) has also indicated that some ""traditional and home remedies"" will provide relief from the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19".
The World Health Organization (WHO) describes capacity building and healthcare reform to meet the needs of COVID-19 patients as a response to a basic infection.
The European Regional Office of the ECDC (ECDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have published guidelines for the transfer of resources to hospitals and primary health services on several levels, including centralization of laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, the abolition of non-compulsory procedures as far as possible, the isolation and isolation of COVID-19 infected patients and the increase of intensive care capacity through the training of staff and the increase in the number of available respirators and beds.
There are various theories as to where the first person infected (called patient Zero) first became infected.

COVID-19 was confirmed from China to South Korea on January 20, 2020.
The country's health agency reported a significant rise in the number of confirmed cases on February 20, which is believed to be due to a rally in Daegu by a new religious movement called the Shinzoonjie Jesus Church.

South Korea has launched what is believed to be the world's largest and best-organized program to detect the spread of the virus among the general public, isolate them if they are infected, track down those who have contact with them and isolate them.

WHO commends efforts by Chinese authorities to control the spread of the disease.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has noted a major shift between the current situation and the current one where the Chinese authorities kept the information secret during the SARS pandemic of 2002-2004. During the current crisis, the central government has "provided periodic updates to avoid panic ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday".
"While this is not recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for sure", said Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization (WHO) representative, regarding the decision of the federal authorities to enforce a traffic stop order in Wuhan on January 23, "it is the most important indicator of commitment to control it in an area of high infection", he said."It is unprecedented in the history of public health", he said."This is the first public health emergency declared by the WHO (WHO) since 2009 when the disease was declared a public health emergency (PHEP) in the world, due to the increasing number of people affected by the disease, and the continued confirmation of human-to-human transmission in countries other than China.
PHEIC was announced in response to the risk of global outbreak, especially in low- and middle-income countries with no strong health systems
Despite the fact that travel restrictions are in place, Tetras has said that ""unnecessary interference in international travel and trade is unnecessary"" and that ""the World Health Organization (WHO) does not recommend reducing trade and movement""
"The World Health Organization (WHO) has called on the global community on February 5 to contribute 675 million dollars to fund strategic preparedness in low-income countries, highlighting the urgent need to help countries that lack systems to diagnose those affected by the virus even if it appears".
Detrose further stated in his statements that ""We are only as strong as our weak link"" and that the international community "will try today or lose more later".During a press conference on February 11, WHO established COVID-19 as the name of the disease.
"On the same day, Tetras said that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres agreed to provide ""the power of the entire UN body to deal with this""".
The result was the creation of a United Nations Crisis Management Committee which would coordinate all the information provided by the United Nations."This would help other organizations focus on health information while providing their expertise to address the impact of the pandemic on broader social, economic and development measures", says the World Health Organization (WHO).
"On February 14, a Joint Working Group led by the World Health Organization (WHO) was set up with China to assist China in domestic management, hold workshops and meetings with key national-level organizations to assess ""the severity and prevalence of the disease"" and conduct a field study to assess ""the impact of prevention measures at the provincial and state levels including urban and rural organizations"" and provide assistance to the International and World Health Organization (WHO) experts in the field in China."On February 25, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that "the world must be prepared for the possibility of spreading the coronavirus as a pandemic", although it was still too late to call it a pandemic, and that the World Health Organization (WHO) said that it should remain in a position to "be prepared for the possibility of spreading the coronavirus as a pandemic"."
"In response to the growing epidemic in Iran, the World Health Organization (WHO) sent a Joint Mission Team to assess the situation. On February 28, World Health Organization (WHO) officials announced that the global coronavirus threat rating would be raised from ""high"" to ""very high"" - the highest level of alert and risk assessment for the virus".
"This is a reality test for every government in the world: it needs to wake up", warned Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization's (WHO) Health Emergency Program in a statement.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Ryan added that there was no need for current data to declare it an international epidemic by public health officials, and that if so, it meant that ""we agreed that every human being on the planet would be infected with the virus"".

Diagnostic and population monitoring can be used for both diagnostics and population monitoring.
Antibiotics can show how many people have had the effect, including those with low or no symptoms.
The results of this study can determine the exact mortality rate and herd immunity of the population.
Due to limited testing, no country has reliable data on the pathogenicity of their total population as of March 2020.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and the number of people tested varies greatly by country.
The variant may significantly affect reported mortality rates, and is likely to be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Real-time Background Transcription Polymerase Chain Request (RRT-PCR) can be tested on breathing samples obtained by various methods including nasopharyngeal pancreatitis or chicken sampling.
Results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR testing with swap from the throat will only yield a reliable result in the first week of disease onset.

During the second week of the test, the patient may use a drainage tube or a cough-coated cough-scan (cough-scan) from the inside of the airway as an alternative sample.
One of the earliest PCR tests was developed in January 2020 in Saradi in Berlin using a real-time backward transcription polymerase chain query (RRT-PCR) and created a database of 250,000 tools for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
January 23, 2020 UK developed testing systems similar to the same as it was then. South Korean company Gojinbiotech PCR-based, clinically-grade, SARS-CoV-2 test instrument (Powercheck Coronavirus) was developed on January 28, 2020.
"This refers to the ""E"" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses and the RDRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2). In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies in China to receive a pre-approval for use from the National Medical Product Administration to use PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 testing tools.
The CDC in Atlanta (CDC) has had its tests disrupted by the fact that one of the three genetic tests in previous versions of the test equipment yielded vague results due to incorrect test materials; as a result, fewer than 100 samples were successfully processed on average per day throughout February 2020.
As of February 28, 2020, tests using two components have not been determined to be reliable, and state and local laboratories have not been allowed to conduct tests until then.
The trial was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Use Authorization.

"A March 2020 article study commented that ""the early stages of chest x-ray diagnosis are less likely, while the results of CT [CT-computed tomography] may even show that symptoms are present before they appear"".
Common features of CT include a dual-multi-dimensional surface-glass optical environment with outer, uneven and rear-distributed light.
When the disease spreads, subclavian veins, respiratory tract and hardening develop.
A study comparing PCR to CT at the start of the current pandemic in Wuhan suggested that although many of the graphic features of CT overlapped with other pneumonia and disease processes, CT could show significantly more clearer effects than PCR
"As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that ""CT should not be used as a first-stage test or first-stage test for COVID-19 diagnosis"". As of March, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that PCR be used for initial testing".

Despite the absence of strict restrictions such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments, the spread of the coronavirus outbreak in Singapore in 2020 has spread at a much slower pace than in other developed countries due to the intensity of contact tracking, inbound travel restrictions, testing and isolation.
Many programs have been cancelled, and on March 28 Singapore began instructing its residents to stay home, but schools reopened on time after a holiday break on March 23.

In a statistical study, countries that tested more had very low mortality rates compared to the death toll because they were able to detect those with mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no optimal testing facilities, and national laboratories with little COVID-19 experience, send their top five confirmed samples and the top ten samples determined to be COVID-19-free to one of the WHO's (WHO) 16 recommended laboratories for testing.
Of the 16 recommended laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.

Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the removal of dirt, grease, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances from one's hands.
"Stepless hand washing with soap at certain ""critical moments"" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are spread through the mouth and through the mouth".
People may also suffer from respiratory illnesses such as whooping cough or a common cold. For example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., lipstick), they may become infected.
Five critical moments in a day when hand washing is compulsory: before and after flushing, after cleaning the bottom of the baby or changing the diaper, before feeding the baby, before eating and after cooking or handling uncooked meat, fish or poultry meat.
If you don't have water and soap, wash your hands with ash.

Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reducing infant mortality in home delivery.
A 2013 study found that improved hand washing habits among children under five years of age may help them increase their height to a small extent.
In developing countries, the introduction of simple behavioral changes such as hand washing with soap can reduce childhood mortality rates related to respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases.

Spirosis is a major cause of acute respiratory illnesses, leading to death in children under five years of age, claiming an estimated 1.8 million lives per year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia cause nearly 3.5 million child deaths annually.
According to UNICEF, making hand washing with soap before eating and after using the toilet a habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, almost halving deaths from diarrhea, and reducing deaths from severe respiratory infections by a quarter.
Handwashing is usually combined with other health promotion programs as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (wash) programs.
Hand washing protects against harmful effects transmitted through direct physical contact.

A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to a corrosive, random skin condition known as a skin irritation or inflammation, which is especially common among healthcare workers.
The most common hand washing is also seen as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times to wash hands with soap to reduce the spread of the disease: after using the bathroom (drinking, flushing), after cleaning a child's bottom (changing clothes), before feeding the baby, before eating and before/after cooking/ after handling uncooked meat, fish or poultry meat.
Other times when the proper hand washing technique is required to prevent the spread of disease are before and after treatment of a cut or wound; after coughing, coughing or sneezing; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.

The main function of soaps and detergents is to reduce solvent barriers and increase solubility.
Water alone is an inefficient skin cleanser because the fats and proteins that are the components of organic soil are not immediately soluble in water.

Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria derived from previous uses.
A small number of studies that tracked the spread of infectious bacteria from contaminated solid soap have concluded that transmission is not possible because the bacteria are being knocked out by the lungs.
CTC still prefers liquid soap with hands-free restrictions".
Antibacterial soaps are highly promoted amongst the health-conscious public.

Antibacterial soaps, however, contain typical antibacterial agents such as trichlose, which has a comprehensive list of antibacterial agents of the organism.

In addition to the peripheral processors and protective factor for the skin, advanced formulas may include pH regulators (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid), benzoic acid, which acts as a microbial agent, and skin processors (carrot, resins, green pepper, plant extracts). A detailed analysis by the Oregon School of Public Health University has shown that soaps with triglycerides are as effective as antibacterial soaps in preventing disease and removing bacteria from the hands.
Hot water, which is convenient for washing hands, is not hot enough to kill bacteria.

Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies show that using hot water has no effect on reducing the number of microorganisms in the hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand sanitizer is a water-based non-hygienic hand sanitizer.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-alcoholic hand sanitizers (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, disinfectant hand rubs, or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol combined with a thickener such as a carborer (a polymer of acrylic acid) as a gel or a moisturizer such as a glycerin as a liquid or foam for simple use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.

Some studies suggest that the overall cost of handwashing in developing countries associated with Dali was neglected.
However, a study suggests that promoting handwashing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
"The importance of hand washing for human health - especially for those in vulnerable situations such as mothers who are born in hospitals or who are injured soldiers - was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis Vienna, Austria and Florence Nightingale,English ""the founder of modern nursing"".
Most people at the time believed that infections were caused by a fungus called miasmas.
After the foodborne illness and health-related infections in 1980, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention heavily promoted hand hygiene as an important means of preventing the spread of infections.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have raised awareness in many countries about the importance of hand washing with soap to protect against such infectious diseases.
"For example, posters on ""proper handwashing techniques"" are hung near handwash tanks in public toilets, office buildings and airports in Germany".
"The phrase ""to wash one's hands"" from something means to declare a reluctance to accept responsibility or share responsibility".

Work that requires frequent or close contact with COVID-19 patients or international travellers who are likely to be affected, unknown or suspected due to the current social outbreak includes medium-risk exposure to hazardous work.
Workers who are in contact with the general public such as schools, densely populated workplaces and some large scale retail businesses.
In addition to the basic infection prevention measures, risk controls for this group include improved ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, smoke detectors and personal protective equipment that can be worn in the event of contact with a COVID-19 affected person.
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) considers health and safety workers who face a person known or suspected of COVID-19 impact to be at high risk of infection. Occupational safety and health administration (OSHA) considers workers who perform samples or handling from a person known or suspected of COVID-19 impact to be at high risk of infection.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
COVID-19 can have many effects in the workplace.
Workers may be unable to work due to health problems, a condition that requires care, or fear of illness.
The business model may change due to changes in the way the goods and supplies are obtained (going to buy goods at times of low congestion or getting goods through delivery or drive-through services).
Finally, shipments of goods from geographically affected areas may be blocked by COVID-19.
The programmes identify the risk factors associated with various workstations and work tasks, including sources of risk deprivation, risk factors arising from home and community settings and risk factors related to elderly or chronically ill individual workers.
They outline the necessary controls to avoid risks and visitor anticipation plans for situations that may result from illness.
Preparedness and Response Programs for the pandemic may be subject to national or academic recommendations.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
The severity of the disease affects the reactions that are received in the community where the business is located.
The Arrangement of Risk Controls is a widely used framework in the field of defence and archaeology to group risk controls by performance.
Where COVID-19 risks are unavoidable, engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and finally the use of personal protective equipment are the most effective control methods.
Inclusives in engineering controls, which involves isolating workers from work-related hazards rather than relying solely on employee behavior, is a very low-cost solution.
Administrative controls are changes in processes or policies that an employee or employer must take.
Personal protective equipment (PPE-PPE) is considered to be less efficient than engineering and management controls, but these can help prevent certain risk levels.
PPEs must be selected on the basis of the potential risk to the personnel, be properly fit (e.g. breathing equipment), uniformly, properly worn, periodically inspected, maintained and replaced if necessary, properly disposed of, cleaned, stored or disposed to avoid cleaning issues.
According to the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk, low-risk occupations have a low degree of professional engagement with the public and other colleagues.
Major prevention measures recommended for all workplaces, such as frequent and regular hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home alone if they are sick, establishing breathing regulations including closing mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, setting up tissue and trash tanks, managing remote working or interrupted working hours if necessary, encouraging workers not to use other people's tools and equipment, and cleaning and disinfecting the workplace normally.
Identify and isolate people who are likely to be infected in a workplace immediately as a critical step towards protecting workers, customers, visitors and others.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with severe respiratory symptoms stay home until they have a fever, flu symptoms, and any other symptoms after not taking flu-reducing or other symptom-modifying medications for at least 24 hours. Medical leave policies are flexible, allow staff to stay home to care for a sick family member, and inform staff about these policies.
According to the OSHA, work that requires frequent or close contact with people who are likely, unknown or suspected of contracting SARS-CoV-2 due to the current social outbreak around the business area, COVID-19 patients or individuals who have recently travelled internationally to an area with a COVID-19 outbreak are considered to be mid-level disruption risky tasks within six (1.8 m) of each other.
Workers who are in contact with the general public in places such as schools, densely populated workplaces and highly populated retail retail systems, such as in places where there is a high population density, may include the installation of physical dependencies and the installation of a smoke-dealing service. The engineering controls established for groups working in such high-risk environments may include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, the increase in ventilation rates, the installation of colorless flexible smoke barriers and the installation of smoke-dealing services. The controls may include the installation of personal safety equipment, including the installation of high-efficiency air filters, the provision of direct access to air traffic control, the installation of a safety system, the installation of a safety system and other information on how to prevent smoke-dealing, the use of smoke-dealing equipment, the introduction of smoke-dealing equipment, the use of smoke-dealing equipment, the use of smoke-dealing equipment, the use of smoke-dealing equipment, the use of smoke-dealing equipment, the use of smoke-dealing equipment, the use of smoke-dealing equipment, the use of smoke-dealing equipment, the use of smoke-dealing equipment, the use of smoke-dealing equipment, the use of smoke-dealing equipment, the use of smoke-dealing equipment, the use of smoke-dealing equipment, and the use of smoke-dealing equipment, etc.

In cases of moderate or low social spread, social distancing strategies can be implemented such as field trips, cancellation of meetings and the use of separate health office space for children with symptoms such as fever, cancellation of large gatherings such as fitness education or serving food in choir classes or restaurants, increasing the gap between tables, interruption of visitation and disruption times.
When there is considerable spread at the local community level, in addition to social distancing strategies, extended school closures can be considered a tactic.The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers that there is little risk for immediate health for law enforcement personnel who understand the routine daily activities.
Law enforcement officials who contact people who have been confirmed or suspected of COVID-19 exposure are advised to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including proper personal protective equipment.
In case of close contact during seizure, work plate and clothing should be cleaned and disinfected with a household cleaning sprayer or wiper before use and common procedures for allocating and removing personal protective equipment (PPE) used, allocating fabrics and washing should be followed.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) classifies some health and safety personnel as being in the category of high or very high risk.
Healthcare providers, support, laboratory services providers and medical transport workers for patients known or suspected of COVID-19 impact are among those doing high-risk work.

WHO recommends that newly arrived patients be kept in separate waiting areas depending on whether they are suspected of COVID-19. OSHA recommends that those who are known to be infected or suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 wear respiratory equipment in situations where they are less than 6 feet away and PPE is possible.
In the United States, NOIH-approved N95 filtration facial respirators or better should be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program that includes qualification testing, training and clinical examinations.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that only staff working at entry points entering or leaving the country wear masks during surgery.
WHO recommends a surgical mask, protective glasses or face shield, gauntlets and gloves for those who collect, care for or carry respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients without aerosol-producing procedures.
In cases where there is a possibility of complications, the N95 or FFP2 respirator is used instead of the surgical mask.
World Health Organization recommends that due to insufficient global supply of personal protective equipment, such as telemedicine, natural barriers such as clear windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to enter the room with a COVID-19 patient, using only personal protective equipment required for specific tasks, while treating multiple patients with the same diagnosis, continuous use of the same respiratory device, monitoring and integrating the personal protective equipment supply chain, and reducing the need for personal protective equipment by encouraging unsigned persons to use masks.

There are some things we need to keep doing.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and fundraising groups (among others) are doing important work that requires additional support.
We will begin a process with all sectors to assess the current objectives and shift our focus to supporting those necessary for our mission.

We accept the changing environment and work to set new targets and timelines where appropriate.
What is APP?
We have proposed to reset the timeline for the implementation of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan to adapt to the new practice and daily working hours expectations.
Our aim is to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 Scheme, which will allow for more time for the next few weeks to plan prioritizing the work, self-care and care of loved ones that is critical to employees while accommodating the reduced schedule for those in need or want.
This extension of deadline significantly reduces the current planning workload and stress throughout the organization.
We will present our plan to the Executive Board next week, and we will update with representatives and committees on the next steps once confirmation is received.
Thank you to the APP Committee for its leadership.

We informed them that we understood that our request for cancellation and other restrictions would not allow them to complete the subsidy measures they had agreed to and that no one would be penalized for delay or change in achieving those targets.
We will follow further guidelines on Wikimedia and other regional and thematic community conferences this week.
For the global community, instead of helping their own communities, Wikipedia and others to focus on clarity and ability, this disruption has generally created grief.
CRT is working on setting up a page on Meta-Wiki for the community to help them track the impact and follow up on our communications with the future in mind.

B'angiodensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2-ACE2) is an enzyme that binds to the outer surface (in the membranes of the cell) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney and intestines.
ACE-2 responds to the action of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the level of angiotensin-II and increasing ang (1-7) making it a promising target drug for the treatment of heart disease. ACE-2 acts as a cell entry point for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as HACCE2.
Anxiodensin-converting enzyme 2 is a polymeric metallic enzyme located on the surface of the inner membrane and other cells.
ACE2 contains the N-terminal peptidease M2 and the C-terminal collector renal amino acid transporter.
ACE2 is a type 1 transurethral membrane protein whose enzyme-activated domain is expressed on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The endometrial field of ACE2 is separated from the membrane field by another enzyme called shetaceous, resulting in the soluble protein being mixed into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.
angiodensin-converting enzyme - 2 is present in most organs:angiodensin-converting enzyme - 2 is primarily associated with the cell cycle of secondary pulmonary alveolar cells, endocytes of the small intestine, endothelial cells of the artery and brain, and soft muscle cells of the muscle in most organs.
ACE2 messenger RNA (mRNA) exposure is found in the cerebrospinal fluid, the thyroid, the esophagus, and the brain stem.
ACE2 has the primary function of acting as an ACE counterbalance.
ACE antioadense I is a hormone that breaks down into vasoconstricte antioadense II.
ACE2 decomposes carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it in the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 may also cause a spillage among many other peptides such as [des-ARG9]-pradicin, epelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and krelin.
ACE2 also regulates SLC6.A19, a neutral amino acid transporter that ensures the distribution of proteins and large molecules in cells.
As a membrane protein, it serves as a major entryway into cells for some coronaviruses, including ACE2 (ACE2), human coronavirus-NL63 (HCoV-NL63), SARS-CoV-SARS, and SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19).
More specifically, binding of the Sars-Corona virus (SARS-CoV) and Sars-Corona virus 2's Spike S1 protein to the enzyme domain of ACE2 on the cell surface transfers both endocytosis and the pathogen and enzyme into endosomes located within cells.
The introduction requires the addition of S protein to the serum serum TMPRSS2 of the supply and is currently being studied as a treatment for the suppression of this protein.
However, many professional associations and regulatory bodies have recommended that the treatment of ACE be continued with a standard ACE suppression and ARP.
"A formal study and cross-examination published on July 11, 2012, found that ""the use of ACE inhibitors is significantly 34% lower risk of pneumonia compared to controls""".
"Additionally, ""ACE inhibitors have also reduced the risk of pneumonia among patients at high risk of pneumonia, particularly those at high risk of stroke and heart failure".
"The use of ACE inhibitors reduces pneumonia-related deaths, although the results are weaker than the overall risk of pneumonia"""
Flexible fusion human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a novel treatment for severe lung injury, and appeared to improve pulmonary circulation and bioavailability in piglets with severe fatty liver-induced respiratory tract syndrome.
RHACE2 has a half-life of about 10 hours in humans, and is 30 minutes before activation, with an additional 24 hours (duration) of benefit.
A number of findings suggest that RHACE2 may be a promising drug for people who are intolerant to classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in circulating angiotensin II-boosting diseases.RHACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of severe respiratory tract syndrome.

As of 7 April 2020, over a dozen expert groups have been working on user-friendly-privacy solutions such as sending user proximity statements to other phones using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
EPPP-PT is a collaborative effort that has centralized and decentralized approaches, not a protocol.  Decentralized protocols include detecting potential interactions in decentralized privacy-protected proximity (DB-PPT/DB-3D), temporary contact numbers (DCN, FKA contact event numbers, CEN), privacy-sensitive protocols, and other protocols for detecting mobile interactions (PACD).
In these protocols, identifiable personal data never leaves the device, and all matches occur on the device.
MIT Media Lab's privacy team is developing SafeBaths, a platform for using privacy-protecting techniques when collecting and using location or path interference information to track the spread of COVID-19.
"This is based on the White Paper's research ""Research published in March 2020 by App's Can Rock: Maintaining Private Privacy in a Pandemic"". Another similar initiative is the secure safe-trace platform of Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technologies, a lab originally established by MIT Media".
SecretResearch uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health information with other users and authorities without compromising the privacy of that information.
On April 5, 2020, the Global TCP-Alliance, a unified group of approaches and often inter-operable protocols, was established with the aim of reducing the global platform for detecting and alerting applications to be a key factor in achieving widespread adoption.

Vaccines in development may not be safe or effective.
ACE2 - Early research to assess vaccine effectiveness using coronavirus COVID-19-specific animal models such as mutant mice, other laboratory animals and non-human animals indicates the need for Level 3 biosecurity control measures and international coordination to address live pathogens to ensure standardized safety practices.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on non-human animal samples.
As of 2020, there is no treatment or safety vaccine that has been proven to be safe and effective in humans for SARS.
According to study papers published in 2005 and 2006, identifying and developing new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.
While MERS was widely practiced, it is believed that existing SARS research could provide an effective template for developing vaccines and treatments against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine has completed Phase I clinical trials in humans, and three trials are underway, all of which are pathogen-spreading vaccines, two adenocarcinogenic pathogen-spreading vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, PVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-pathogen-spreading vaccine (MVA-MERS-S).

Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
The disease has been reported locally in most of the six WHO regions.
People with this disease may have no symptoms or may have symptoms of whooping cough, fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty waking up, and blue face or lips; immediate medical treatment is recommended if these symptoms are present.
Rarely, upper respiratory symptoms such as dizziness, nosebleeds or throat ulcers can be seen.

The lungs are the most affected by COVID-19, as the virus reaches the host cells via an enzyme called angiodensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is abundant in type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
mull (peplomer) uses a unique exogenous glycopyramid to interact with ACE2 and enter another cell.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Heart rates are high due to anti-inflammatory and immune system disorders during disease progression, but severe heart failure may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
Examination of the remains of those who died due to COVID-19 revealed microorganism damage (difus alveolar damage-DAD-DAD), and inflammatory infiltrations with pineal cell.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has an inductive affinity for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, severe COVID-19 patients have symptoms of organ-related high inflammation.
In particular, GM-CSF T-cell-extracting disease has been shown to be associated with the development of single cell-extracting IL-6 inflammation and severe lung disease in COVID-19 patients.
The autopsy revealed infiltration of the lymph nodes.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard method of testing is real-time retrospective transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR).
Testing is usually performed on breathing samples obtained from a nasopharyngeal duct; however, a nasopharyngeal duct or chicken sample may also be used.

Mild pneumonia: pneumonia, pneumocytosis, hyperplasia, large variation of the lymphocyte, lymphocytic penetration, intermittent inflammation and the formation of multi-nuclear large cell
Severe pneumonia:Diagnosed alveolar damage (DAD) with contagious alveolar leakage.
DAD is the cause of severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe blood loss.
Treatment of pneumonia: structure of leaks in alveolar cavities and pulmonary intermediate fibrosis
Blood: Wide circulatory freeze (DIC); increased plasma response
Medicines to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water and washing for at least 20 seconds, maintaining good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends that the mouth and nose be covered with a dish when both are or are being swallowed and that the inside of the knee be used if no dish is available.
Proper hand hygiene is encouraged after coughing or diarrhea.
CDC has recommended the use of cloth masks in public places to control the spread of the disease by the unknown.  Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact of victims with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and cancelling large public gatherings.

CDC recommends that individuals wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when their hands are dirty, before eating and after someone's nose is rubbed, dizzy or tingled.
It also recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol content, but only when soap and water are not immediately available. For areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not immediately available, WHO provides two formulas for local production.
In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to remove bacterial seeds from alcohol; it is not ""an active ingredient for hand anti-sepsis"."

People are managed with supportive care, which can include fluid therapy, reanimation, and support for other key organs affected.
CDC recommends that those suspected of carrying the virus wear a simple mask.
Extracorporal membrane oxidation (ECMO), was used to address the problem of respiratory disorders, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to improve immunity.
Complementary treatments will be effective for those with mild symptoms in the early stages of infection. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have issued recommendations for the care of hospitalized people with COVID-19.
The American Board of Urology and the American Board of Pneumology have compiled treatment recommendations from various organizations into a free resource called IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acidaminopone) instead of ibuprofen for first-line use.
Conservations should be made to reduce the spread of the disease, especially during procedures where health systems can release fluids such as the use of a hand-operated respirator or a hose.
CDC recommends that healthcare professionals who are caring for COVID-19 use consistent precautions, contact precautions and airborne spread precautions in addition to placing a person in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR).
Recommended Equipment: PPE, respirator or mask, eye protection, and medical gloves.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial applications, but masks are approved by the FDA for use under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particulates such as dust, but are not guaranteed for effectiveness against a specific biological agent for unauthorized use.
CDC recommends using masks when masks are not available or, lastly, home-made masks.
️Most COVID-19 patients do not have a severe condition requiring artificial respiration or alternatives, but a certain percentage do.
The type of respiratory support for people with COVID-19 related respiratory disorder is being studied intensively with some evidence that hospitalized people can avoid entry with high flowing nasal duct or double-level positive airway pressure.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Some doctors prefer perforated mechanical ventilation when available, as this technology limits the spread of particle drip compared to a high-flow nasal cannula.
Many developed countries do not have adequate hospital beds for individuals, which limits the capacity of healthcare systems to handle COVID-19 patients who are in need of rapidly rising hospital admission.
A study in China found that 5% of people were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed ventilation machine assistance, and 1.4% died.
30% of people in China who are infected with COVID-19 and hospitalized are finally admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).
COVID-19 causes severe respiratory syndrome (ARTS) and oxidation becomes increasingly difficult to ventilate.
Pressure control methods and high PEEP-efficiency artificial respirators are needed to reduce the risk of ventilation-related lung injury and pulmonary embolism (pneumothorax) and increase bioavailability.

Individuals may experience pain from isolation, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection.
Rory O'Connor, BBC, pointed out that increased social exclusion, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic decline are the right storm to harm people's mental and physical health
The disease may take a moderate course with or without symptoms, similar to other common upper respiratory diseases such as common cold.
Moderate effects usually heal within two weeks, whereas those with already severe or complex illnesses may take three to six weeks to heal.
Based on data from other viruses such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women may be at higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection, but data for COVID-19 is limited.
COVID-19 can progress rapidly to severe respiratory disorder syndrome (ARDS) in severely affected people, leading to respiratory failure, spastic shock or multiple organ failure.

The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Due to capacity constraints in common supply chains, some digital manufacturers print sanitary items such as nasith wipers and synthetic respirators.
When an Italian hospital needed a ventilator valve urgently, for example, and the provider was unable to deliver the required amount of time, a local startup company re-engineered and printed the required 100 valves overnight.
Following the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misinformation about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged and spread rapidly through the Internet.

International research on COVID-19 vaccines and medicines is being conducted by government agencies, academic groups and industry researchers.
"In March, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a ""conformity test"" to assess the therapeutic effects of four antigenic compounds that are well functioning on the basis of existing performance".
️There are no vaccines currently available, but various companies are actively developing vaccines.
Sars-CoVs are used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
Tri vaccination strategies are being explored.
The first goal of the researchers is to develop a complete vaccine against the disease.
The use of such pathogen, whether inactivated or dead, aims to demonstrate the human body's immunity against the new COVID-19 infection.
Secondary Strategic, Sub-Level Vaccines, aims to develop a vaccine that will make the immune system sensitive to certain subgroups of the virus.
As for SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a modern technology for vaccine manufacture).
The strategy is to test the safety and efficacy of the vaccine in the trials derived from Ida. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine with four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine has a non-infectious genetic code copied from the pathogenic virus.Immunodevelopment in vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 is suggested as a potential challenge, but it is debatable.
As of April 2020, over 300 active clinical trials are underway.
Seven trials assess the treatment for malaria that is already approved, including four trials for hydroxychloroquine or chloroguine.
Chinese studies are mostly targeted antibiotics, with the results of nine Phase III trials on Remdesvir expected by the end of April.
A dynamic review of clinical developments for COVID-19 vaccine and drug contributors was ongoing through April 2020. Existing pathogenic vaccines for the treatment of COVID-19 are being evaluated, including remdesivir, chlorokine and hydroxychloroquine, lobinavir/ritonatavir and ritonatavir in combination with lobinavir/interferon beta.
As of March 2020, there is provisional evidence of efficacy of Remdesivirol.
The clinical progress was seen in patients receiving unapproved remdesivir treatment.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the United States, China and Italy.Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020 with preliminary results.

Virus neutralization is the expected mechanism of action by which passive antiprotein therapy can mediate protection against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antiprotein-based cellular cytotoxicity and/or bacocytosis are possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, the use of synthetic antibodies, are in progress.
The production of antibodies containing the liquid portion of the blood taken from recovered patients and specific immunity to this pathogen can be increased for rapid use.
