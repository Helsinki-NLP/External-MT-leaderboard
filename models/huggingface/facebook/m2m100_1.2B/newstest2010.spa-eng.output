Barack Obama is the fourth US president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
U.S. President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway to spend 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth U.S. president in history.
The diploma, medal and $1.4 million check will be awarded, among other things, for the exceptional effort in strengthening world diplomacy and cooperation between nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will arrive in the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and have a lot to do.
First, visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time with the five members of the committee that, in October, chose him from 172 people and 33 organizations.
Afterwards, the presidential couple is scheduled for a meeting with Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon, the visit will culminate with a ceremony in which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive him, but the third to receive him in office.
The White House has already announced that, when it receives the prize, it will talk about the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid this issue, knowing that he is receiving the award as president of a country that is currently at war in two countries.
His war efforts increased even more with the sending of additional troops to Afghanistan, which does not forget to mention any of his critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, the diploma and the check of ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
It is proposed to donate charitable paraffins, but it has not yet decided which organization in particular.
During his full program, the President and his wife will participate in a banquet to which they will attend, in addition to the Norwegian kings, the Prime Minister and 250 other guests.
Obama from the beginning had a rather reserved attitude towards the prize.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling that he did not deserve it entirely.
He also repeated several times that the award is not just for him, but for all those who fight for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement he mentioned that it represents “a challenge to take action.”
Conservative accused of blackmail
Litoměřice police accused the president of the civic association Společnost ochránců přírody Litoměřice (Litoměřice Society of Nature Defenders) of blackmail.
Last year it appealed several times against some construction licensing procedures and to withdraw the appeals demanded investors money for their own benefit, said Litoměřice police spokeswoman Alena Romová.
The president of the Society of Nature Defenders Litoměřice is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently detained and faces a sentence of up to three years in prison.
Brno does not like containers too much to separate garbage
In Prague, citizens can separate drink packaging and in the southern Moravian villages you can find containers to separate garbage everywhere.
What about Brno?
Allise needs several minutes to find the respective containers.
I do not want to say that in Brno the garbage is not separated for nothing.
It seems to me that, to be the second largest city in the Republic, municipalities are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is completely behind in the separation of garbage, not only because we, citizens, can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but above all by the number of containers for such waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, to throw in the center a PET bottle to the right container?
It is almost impossible, especially requires a lot of time and patience.
The only place I have found so far is in the Moravské náměstí square, in front of the Potrefená Huse.
That Mr Onderka and his colleagues are not angry with me, but that seems to me too little.
It is not necessary to mention that in other places it is also not easy to separate garbage.
That’s why many of my friends prefer not to separate her.
by Vagancia
The containers are far away.
I am not surprised.
I offered myself, after a party, to throw several glass and plastic bottles into the garbage.
But on Kaunicova Street I saw no red container nearby.
Fortunately, on the way to the train, I found the right place.
However, the rubbish was already flowing out of the container.
It’s still the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn’t it?!
What happens is that ecology and aesthetics do not seem to interest Brno’s socialists too much.
They prefer to buy the city the hockey extraliga, which embarrasses us throughout the republic, and not to buy more containers or offer the separation of other materials so that Brno is cleaner.
I am delighted to be able to compare my hypothesis, after browsing the Internet a little, with the official statistics.
According to EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst of the entire Jihomoravský kraj region.
Budget "Paroubek" removed money from income and sickness subsidies
After the left, despite the government’s opinion, added funds for farmers or officials, there may not be enough money in the budget for incomes, sickness subsidies, or for construction savings.
But neither for the interests of the state debt or international disputes.
This will hurt everyone who governs in the second half of next year, said Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase for some groups, they trusted that the government would subsequently ask for a loan for sensitive spending, income or illness subsidies.
What happens is that when you borrow money, you have to pay increasingly high interest and, someday, you have to return the money.
The state does not have many options to get money.
If you do not reduce the state’s social subsidies or operating expenses, you have to raise taxes.
To all those to whom the left added now: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
Later, his children too.
People don’t have to worry about income or sickness subsidies, they will receive them.
But the price to be paid will be the increase in public debt; next year there will be no shortage in the treasury of only 163 billion, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, debt will continue to rise alongside interest expenses.
The state will need money to cover them and will no longer come up with slightly increasing VAT or reducing maternity allowances, as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
Due to the displacement of the money in favor of some groups of voters, next year will also be missing five billion to finish the construction of highways and railways.
This is especially true of sectors in which the bidding has already been held and where the construction process has already begun, whose projects cannot be changed and their price cannot be reduced.
The most you can do is keep them, which is also not free.
That means delay or cessation of the thirty large constructions; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also at risk, warns Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
ČSSD proposed a salomonic solution to the reduction of funds: it will get money from the dividends of ČEZ, which is mostly owned by the State, and add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never secure, nor is it a bottomless bag.
Last year, ČEZ allocated $18 billion to the budget.
Each year of the dividends are liquidated ecological damage, serve to complete the account for the income or serve as a reserve for the prepared reform of the income.
Moreover, with this trick, according to EU rules, the real budget deficit rises to 5.7% of GDP.
The carnival of money transfers does not end here.
Nearly three billion were obtained from the budget to grant various compensations to victims of communism and crimes, or for litigation expenses, even in construction savings.
It is unclear whether the state will need such funds.
It is a lottery.
If we lose some international litigation, we may have to pay for it, says Janota.
After that, the Minister will have to save money within the resource or, in the worst case, take the government budget reserve.
There are also hundreds of millions left for the Státní pokladna (State Cash) project, whose price is two billion and which has already been started.
The first phase begins in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop and sanctions will come, Janota warns.
Your future smartphone will be able to run with two operating systems
The Americans will have a mobile phone in which the user can, by pressing a key, switch between several operating systems.
The plans revealed sound promising.
With just one press, they move from Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
Precisely this possibility is the goal of the American company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualizing software for computers.
You can use two user profiles at the same time.
They will be able to change between them and divide them between home and work.
The two operate at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was introduced in November last year and several days ago it was demonstrated for the first time.
It will launch in 2012.
The virtualization of smart phones is no longer a fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800, modified with a 128 MB RAM, where the aforementioned systems, Windows Mobile and Android, work at the same time.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is at its peak.
VMware is cooperating with European and U.S. operators to test smartphone virtualization and these phones will arrive to customers during the year 2012.
The shortage of snow in the mountains worries hotel owners
Not only telescopes in Krkonoše are concerned about snow-free slopes.
The shortage of snow makes people not book skiing stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, in Krkonoše you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We have a lot of visitors on our pages.
People look at the offers, check the prices, but still are afraid to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask about our opinion, whether there will be snow or mud this Christmas," said Martin Jandura, the managing director of the Spindl.Info news portal.
Those wishing to spend a New Year's Eve in Špindlerův Mlýn according to their expectations should no longer hesitate to book their stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation in second place can try to wait a few more days.
The hotelers of Špindlerův Mlýn offer mainly weekly stays for New Year's Eve.
I think they will continue to offer them, but they will soon give up and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will be sold quickly, Jandura estimated.
Ingotours, a Vrchlabí travel agency, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
The most important part of the week is Christmas, which is not over yet.
Half of the seats are still free.
That’s why we have already prepared some last-minute Christmas stays,” said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí travel agency can still offer Christmas in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free seats.
They sell very well also the first fourteen days of February, the remaining winter dates are sold regularly.
This year’s interest in winter stays is compromised by the lack of snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting to see if there is snow.
No one wants to spend the weekend in the mountains without snow.
If the pistes remain snowy during the week, the Christmas dates will be exhausted as well,” Schiefert says.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to occupy the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou; last year was more difficult.
We are about five percent better.
For Christmas and Christmas we have the last free seats.
Interest increases during the Polish holidays in January and February and it sells well," said the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of the Christmas holidays are already occupied in the Omnia Hotel, near the central parking lot in Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, in the newest Janské Lázně hotel on Christmas, half of the beds are still free.
This January was a big surprise for us, as we find ourselves at about sixty percent of the capacity.
February has been a little weaker, but as snow falls, interest in Krkonoše stays will surely increase, said Erik Sporysch, the director of the Omnia hotel.
At the moment, however, it seems that Krkonoše hotel owners will be waiting for snow.
On Thursday, temperatures are expected to drop and, if there are rainfall, in the mountains it should snow.
But then temperatures will rise again, Jiří Jakubský of Hradec Králové, the hydrometeorological institute of the Czech Republic.
Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is comic that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest man, as a diligent student repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself took for the dumbest.
When he finally revealed his long-awaited Afghan approach, it proved to be a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only is the phrase "as in Iraq" used several times in the same text, but he also hesitated to use the title of the January 2007 Bush declaration for his own declaration: "A new way forward."
It was he himself, who three years ago criticized Bush’s idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering from the civil war, and that criticized him as “an irresponsible decision with catastrophic consequences.”
The following months, however, proved that Bush’s strategy, based on the recommendations of field captains, was the only possible and successful, so that today there is no talk about Iraq in the news.
Bush’s reputation did not improve, but it objectively left his successor in a much more favorable initial situation than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama expects the miracle to be repeated.
Field captains again asked him to increase the military contingent, especially Afghan Operation Chief Commander General Stanley McCristal. He, even despite traditional subordinate relations, subjected the indecisive gunmen in the White House to harsh criticism.
He called for 40,000 men to improve the situation.
The president hesitated for three months, but nothing better happened to him, so at least he deceived the general over 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to get Europe to promise him another 5,000, although he himself previously had at least 10,000.
The most problematic of all Obama’s strategy seems to be his goal, to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and finish this procedure in three years.
Many doubt that the increase will yield the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraq’s society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: no one can be trusted and no agreement is met.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces if they are accustomed to changing their boss every day according to their needs.
Political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a people of Potemkin.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinarily complicated due to confusing relations, even more complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even establishing a state that is "capable of action," a minimum goal of the entire operation, seems very real.
The horizon of Obama’s strategy shocks by his voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to deteriorate and is now about to erupt.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing about reality, can believe that the military sent to war so that they "come home soon," will do some miracle here.
From a political point of view, fixing the date for the withdrawal of the troops is pure irresponsibility, as the Taliban will regard it as an indirect declaration of the American defeat.
The recent NATO summit showed that Europeans are increasingly less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, and do not want to explain to their voters, what the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the war with the Hindu Kush.
The other factor, capable of radically affecting the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and the increased sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the US will have to make a difficult decision: try to solve the problem with military force or not.
The answers will need to be sought precisely when, according to Obama, America begins the triumphant withdrawal of its troops from Afghanistan.
However, any such solution will mean a dramatic reversal for the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years to the presidential election and therefore there is still a lot of time to find another strategy, if this is a total failure.
Goldman Sachs’ executives will no longer receive cash bonuses
The senior executives of Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses this year.
The entity announced it to react to the harsh criticism of its salary practices.
The group of 30 senior executives will receive, instead of money, shares that cannot be sold in a minimum period of five years.
In addition, the shares may be withdrawn in the event that they have assumed excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs has thus become the leader in the effort to unite Wall Street bonuses with long-term power.
I suppose Wall Street is fully aware of the longest path it has to take, said former JPMorgan banking investor Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs faced the criticism after removing $17 billion (nearly CZK 300 billion) for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses in the entity for this year, according to Reuters, is likely to exceed, despite the measure announced today, $20 billion.
High bonuses in the banking sector became, with the arrival of the financial crisis, a delicate topic in politics.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to levy a one-time tax of fifty percent on bank bonuses exceeding £25,000 (approximately CZK 712,000).
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year, women were awarded the Nobel Prize in all categories except physics.
Five women, which is a record number, received this year’s Nobel Prizes in specialized categories and literature in Stockholm from King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden.
In addition to the four scientists, among the award winners was also a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as their compatriot Jack Szostak for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Israelis Ada Jonath and Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for their explanation of the structure and function of ribosomes.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to American economist Elinor Ostrom and his fellow economist Oliver Williamson for the analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without a woman awarded, was Physics.
This award was awarded to scientists Charles Kao for their research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which constitutes the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or telescopes.
Each laureate received a diploma, a Nobel medal and a certificate of the money received.
This sum in each category is up to ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 25 million Czech crowns).
If there are several prize winners in each category, the prize is shared between them.
The long-awaited Nobel Peace Prize was presented today in Oslo, Norway, to US President Barack Obama.
In his speech he recognized the controversy of having been awarded, since he is at the beginning of his career and is at the head of a country that participates in two wars: in Iraq and Afghanistan.
To defend his policy he added, however, that in certain situations wars are essential for achieving peace, even if their price is high.
Minister Janota considers resignation: Klaus invited him to the castle
President Václav Klaus will receive Finance Minister Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who is considering his stay in the government, as he does not agree with the version of the state budget for the coming year, approved on Wednesday by the Chamber of Deputies.
It is supposed that the budget, and also Janota’s stay in the cabinet, will be the topics of his Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the public finance crisis.
This was by President Radim Ochvat.
On his stay in the role, Janota wants to negotiate on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget law, prepared to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of SEK 163 billion.
The House of Representatives, however, approved on Wednesday left-wing proposals for fund transfers and increased money for official wages, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government disagrees with the proposals of the Social Democrats, as they covertly increase the budget deficit.
Between the left on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right on the other, a serious internal policy conflict occurred.Because of this conflict, the future activities of Fischer's bureaucratic cabinet, whose form was agreed in spring by the ODS, ČSSD and the Green Party, begin to be controversial.
Critics say the budget, in the version approved by the House of Representatives, de facto liquidates the package of austerity measures, imposed in autumn by Fischer’s government to curb public debt.
Klaus can but does not have to sign the law on the state budget; today he declared during a breakfast with businessmen that politicians have long been disregarding "the serious problem", that is, "the unsustainable deficit" of public finance.
They no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, which can rely on a broader consensus among political parties, could improve this situation.
ODS leader Mirek Topolánek mentioned, that the budget is terrifying and that the government should think about its future existence.
ODS Vice President Petr Nečas told ČTK that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Greens obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and called similar words "strong sentences."
ČSSD chief Jiří Paroubek reacted to Topolánek saying the budget deficit is terrifying, prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek.
On Wednesday, ČSSD said that the approval of the state budget for the coming year was successful.
The people were also pleased.
Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new film, played by Morgan Freeman
South Africans say the new Hollywood film, Invictus: Invencible, tells a lot about the country, its struggle and victories, although some critics say the main roles are played by American actors.
The story talks about sport, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and his first black president, Nelson Mandela, is played in his biography by Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that Mandela, 91, asked him to play him in the Eastwood movie.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I said, “When you interpret it, I’ll have access to you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who received the award for his role in the Eastwood drama about the world of boxing Million Dollar Baby, played the role of the leader of the slave abolition movement, who ended up being a slave, of the fictional US president, and even of God in Evan Almighty.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his activities to end apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invencible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film is a true story about Nelson Mandela, who joined forces with South African rugby team captain Francois Pienaar to help unite the country.Mandela, the new president, knows that after apartheid his nation remains racial and economically divided.
He believes he is able to unite his people through sport, and so he decides to unite rugby players, who belong to the outsiders worldwide.
The South African team reached the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked several years for the story of Mandela to come to theaters.
I had no other goal than to play this role in such a way that it was as similar to reality as possible, Freeman said.
Of course, the biggest challenge was speaking like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would have tried to meet with Mandela, dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to stretch his hand to Mandela.
I discovered that by holding his hand, I get his energy, it is transmitted and I had the feeling of knowing how you feel, he said.
It is important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which white players predominated.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough world of rugby.
A great surprise for him was, when he finally met for the first time with Pienaar at his home.
I remember knocking at the door, he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was: “In the movie I look much louder.”
Despite the obvious differences between the characters of the actors and their real models, and under the management of the director Eastwood, Invictus: Invencible received positive reviews and ambitions for the Oscar are also talked about.
Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy summarized his assessment with these words: "It was a very good story, a very well-made film."
In the film reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent of positive reviews.
The secret of the splendor over Norway solved: the Russians tested a missile
Over Norway a special light effect of unknown origin was observed.
Russia’s Defense Ministry has acknowledged that it has tested an intercontinental ballistic missile near its border with Norway.
The Bulava-type missile, previously intended to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even their repeated presence in missile tests has not had the desired effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulavá, in most cases, did not fly or a failure in the air occurred.
Russian newspapers write of Bulava as “a missile that does not fly.”
A missile that does not fly, but shines.
During this, the 13th test, no problems occurred at first.
At the end of the flight there were again technical problems in the aircraft.
The engine probably exploded in the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulavá" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which floated submerged in the White Sea.
This type of missile makes it possible to launch from a ship that is moving and submerged at the same time.
That’s why it’s likely that the mysterious light on Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the failed “Bulavá.”
The Norwegians from the very beginning did not hesitate that it was a Russian missile.
The generals this time defend themselves by saying that one cannot simply speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile ended and the crash occurred in the third.
In the previous cases, the engines were immediately damaged in the first stage.
Although none of the launches took place completely without errors, according to the Ministry of Defense management, only six of the thirteen were failed.
The success of almost fifty percent fills the generals with optimism and therefore they continue to say that "Bulavá" one day will fly without problems and that it will even manage to carry up to ten nuclear hypersonic blocks, whose maximum total weight is 1.15 tons.
Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51.
Legendary defender Viacheslav Fetisov will return to a professional hockey match at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup winner will help his team CSKA Moscow and possibly play on Friday in the KHL duel against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov ended his professional career at the age of forty in 1998 and currently chairs the CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov constantly practises and is committed to helping the team.
We only have to solve some formal matters, the AP agency quoted Sergei Nemchynov, the Moscow club’s coach.
It is not yet clear whether the famous player’s return will refer to a single game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can raise the spirit of the other players, Nemchinov said.
According to AP, if Fetisov returns to the ice runs, he will become the oldest professional player in Russian hockey.
Legendary forward Gordie Howe played in the NHL for Hartford at the age of fifty-one, during the entire season, and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The largest of the group of the five famous players Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union he won two Olympic golds, seven world championships, triumphed in the Canada Cup and in the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career he also had successes in the NHL: playing with Detroit he won the Stanley Cup twice.
Since 2001 he is a member of the Hall of Fame hockey.
Hyundai Complies with Trade Union Requirements, Cancels All Supplementary Work
The management of the automobile factory in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all additional work.
Due to the frequent additional work, the unions declared a strike emergency on Monday.
This was confirmed by Petr Vaněk, a spokesman for Hyundai Motor Company.
This year, however, the leadership wants to agree with the trade unions on another turn on Saturday.
We can’t give up on our manufacturing plan, as it’s essential.That’s why we’ve proposed voluntary additional work for Saturday, December 19, that is, it’s going to be worked in two turns, Vaněk said.
According to the server Sedmička.cz, the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees who work on the Saturday shift.
The bonus will also be paid for last Saturday, November 28.
According to Vaňka, the company decided to change the way it motivates its employees with the additional work offered.
Employees can charge the bonus for overtime or they can take a day off on December 28, that is, extend Christmas holidays in one day, Vaněk mentioned.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shifts will receive money for the trip and for food.
Because supplementary work was the most urgent and problematic point of comments and complaints from trade unionists and strikers, who stopped manufacturing last week, management yesterday afternoon decided to immediately cancel all supplementary work for December, Vaněk mentioned.
Employees at the car factory were forced to work two more hours in addition to eight-hour shifts and this situation lasted virtually every day until last week.
After the agreement is signed, the unions will cancel the strike.
Another negotiation between the factory management and the trade unions should take place on Monday morning.
Trade union leader Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that if they commit to meeting the requirements and the document is signed, they are ready to cancel the emergency by strike.
The situation in the automobile factory worsened last week on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike for frequent additional jobs.
They also protested against poor payment conditions and alleged harassment.
The management thought that employees had to work overtime to meet the requirements and be able to supply the cars.
The unionists in their declaration of the strike emergency on Monday also demanded that none of the employees, who last Wednesday interrupted the manufacture, be penalized in any way.
As far as supplementary work is concerned, unions demand that the company reduce it to a minimum.
In addition, this year they require a salary of 5,000 crowns for this work.
Hyundai’s Nošovice automobile plant currently employs 2,000 people.
Serial production began last November.
Until last September, it produced approximately 80,000 cars; its current production potential is 200,000 cars a year.
A Czech Discovery: An Effective Substance Even in ‘Called’ HIV Viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds capable of moderating the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this enhanced substance is the fact that it is also effective against drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus as some affordable drugs already do.
AIDS cannot be cured so far.
However, the lives of patients can be significantly extended thanks to a mixture of drugs that prevent the replication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If the replication of the virus is not completely suppressed, so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, drugs no longer work.
The work of experts from three Institutes of the Czech Academy of Sciences, VŠCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg demonstrates the possibility of mastering the resistance of the virus.
They demonstrated that substances called metal-carborans have an effect on albumin, which is responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
Carbons are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a different way than all medicines used today, and therefore can solve the problem of resistance.
In their work, the scientists find new, ‘improved’ compounds, prepared by knowing the molecular mechanism of their link to the virus’s albumin.
Carbon metals have a unique three-dimensional structure: two polyhedral cages composed of the boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are joined by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A traitor and resistant virus
HIV protease is an albumin of the HIV virus, and is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, HIV virus fractionation does not occur and matured and infectious corpuscles of the virus would not be created.
If we stop the HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, scientists explain in a news release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Czech Academy of Sciences.
In an article published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two pairs of cages (see table) are joined by a short organic series, which continues to be systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more effective.
The test of the effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was carried out on probeta, and also against its resistant variants, obtained from HIV patients.
The effect of metal-carbonates on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in clinically used drugs, however they do not lose their effect on resistant variants, in which drugs often do not work.
The mechanism of the unique effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications makes, that metal-carbonates are interesting compounds for research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Řezáčová, head of the laboratory of Structural Biology at the Institute of Organic and Biochemical Chemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics at the Academy of Sciences.
ODS attacked Fischer, he defends himself
SDG chief Mirek Topolánek said the budget approved for next year is "horrific" and Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should, according to him, think about its future existence.
The ODS statements were pointed out by the prime minister as strong sentences.
There is time for analysis.
ODS Vice President Petr Nečas said the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Nečas, the prime minister has to decide whether in the Chamber of Deputies he wants to support the minority, which tries to fight the growing deficit, or if he wants to stay in his position with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of SDGs and social democracy towards the public deficit problem is completely different, Nečas warned.
The House of Deputies approved the budget for 2010, however with the amendments proposed by the left, for more than 12 billion crowns.
The House of Representatives increased money for state officials’ salaries, for social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government has criticized the SDG proposals, as they coveringly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should rule with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
ODS before the vote came out of the room and so fulfilled the government’s wish, that the amended budget is better than a provisional budget.
Disappointment and Inutility
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and feeling useless; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government would re-evaluate the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened to resign in the event of approval of the amending proposals, the situation could have been different.
According to Česká televize Janota asked for a meeting with the prime minister.
He said he is considering staying in the show.
The reason is their disappointment with the negotiations on the budget.
If Fischer agrees with another struggle against the budget deficit, according to Nečas in the government have nothing to do the nominees by the ČSSD, which imposed the changes in the budget.
The prime minister should also clearly say if he resigns, if the house passes other laws that increase the deficit, for example those relating to sickness subsidies, income, or amendment to the service law.
Topolánek: Ministers nominated by the ODS are not to blame
This is the responsibility of the Prime Minister and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the SDG have done nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in the US text news.
He recalled that in several ministries in the positions of locals there are people who belong to the TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed, that if Fischer decides to resign the principle of the struggle with the height of the public deficit, "it is absolutely logical and correct, that it is supported by the leftist majority, which is currently in the Chamber of Deputies."
However, it will not be able to count on the support and tolerance of the ODS members.
I have not thought about it, when the time comes, I will take care of it, Defense Minister Martin Barták, who was appointed for the government precisely by the ODS members, told reporters in the Chamber of Deputies.
Prime Minister Fischer in the afternoon went to a meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
ODS resigned at the request of the Prime Minister
Nečas stressed, that SDGs on Wednesday in the Chamber of Deputies would probably vote against the amended budget, if the prime minister does not explicitly ask SDGs MPs to allow the acceptance of the budget.
We do not feel as orphans, we are not small children, he reacted to the question, if the ODS is not concerned about the absence of the party leader in parliament and in the Czech Republic, during the budget negotiations.
I didn’t realize my vote was missing.
When he resigned from office, he knew that in the following months it was primarily about Bolshevism of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek himself reacted.
According to the new train schedule of ČD will run fewer trains for almost the same rates
České dráhy (Czech Railways) from December 13 will cancel or restrict some of the less used fast and local trains and, on the contrary, will strengthen some links.
The total extent of traffic will be reduced by two percent compared to today, after the new train schedule comes into force.
Most tariffs including the base and customer price will not change.
More possibilities of links to the capital will gain for example the inhabitants of the Ostravsko region, dráhy for this line will add a pedestrian carriage.
The direct train, on the contrary, will not travel back to Bratislava.
On the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice will run fewer fast trains, direct links Prague - Letohrad will be restricted.
In the regions, the largest reduction in transport planned by dráhy is in the Hradec Králové region, eight percent in total, on the contrary, transport will increase in Prague and the surrounding area.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice route will also be cancelled and some fast trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will be reduced to only a few days of the week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to move to Lysá nad Labem.
It is the 15th line of the Esko system, around the cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Long-distance connections to the capital will end at Prague Hlavní nádraží station.
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will run every two hours.
As of December 13, travelers will no longer be able to travel to Bratislava by Pendolino.
Regional railway bill this year: 200 million more than before
The high-speed trains are commissioned and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called demonstrable losses Dráhy will receive next year four billion crowns in total, just like this year.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For the high-speed and local trains dráhy have a new contract of ten years, until now the contract was always one year.
Dráhy are pleased with the system, and that is why they did not raise the prices of the vast majority of tickets.
Changes will only occur on the one-day tickets - ČD Net and on the cheap internet tickets eLiška.
For travelers without a customer card, the ČD Net price will increase from 450 to 600 kronor.
The price of eLiška will depend on the distance, so far there was the single price of 160 crowns for trips between any two regional cities.
Philippine armed forces continue to detain more than 50 people, children released
Armed forces have kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including several primary school students and their teachers.
This was stated by AFP, which previously only about 65 kidnappings.
All 17 children and a teacher were released after eight hours.
The attack took place in the Southern province of Agusan.
They say about 19 armed men use the hostages as a living shield in the escape from the police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree on the surrender of the remaining hostages.
The armed forces belong to the New People’s Navy (NPA), an armed faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police previously pursued the kidnappers due to violence, whose cause was the settlement of accounts between two clans of local families.
In the south of the Philippines in the province of Maguindanao was because of the recent massacre, in which 57 people died, imposed the martial law.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre, related to the governor’s election, were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of involvement in the slaughter they arrested the governor of this province in the south of the Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of an influential dynasty of the Ampatuan.
On the island of Mindanao also operate Muslim separatists.
On Tuesday, however, they resumed peace talks with the Philippine government.
RSA’s history concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days a new Hollywood film, Clint Eastwood's Invictus (his official title in Czech is Invictus: Neporažený), will be released in the U.S. cinemas, capturing a part of the biography of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous anti-apartheid fighter is played by Morgan Freeman, whom Mandela himself chose years ago for the protagonist role.
The second role, the legendary rugby champion Francoise Pienaar, was played by Matt Damon.
The film comes from the reactions of critics and the public.
by Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, born on July 18, 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sacharov Prize for freedom of thought, in 1993 he received, along with Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
There are great hopes, as it comes to the public at the time, when in the Republic of South Africa culminate preparations for the world football championship.At the same time the media are shaken by alarming news about the growing racial hatred and the discrimination of the inhabitants by the dominant black majority.
According to the AP news agency, the reactions to this new film in RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of the protagonist roles by the "uninteresting" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, says he is proud of the new film.
For many years I dreamed of the role and prepared myself well to play it.
Many times I met in person with Nelson Mandela, to - as they say - collect his energy, he mentioned in an interview after the festival premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it’s good, if through the film we can recall Mandela’s character and message.
It’s a history of the Republic of South Africa, but it refers to everyone, he added.
National Rugby Team Dress
The film is based on the book by British writer John Carlin with the title freely translated In the Role of the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game. Thanks to this game the nation was born.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of inhabitants, racially and for long years apart. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he as the protagonist also puts the suit of the South African national rugby team and enters the playing field.
By entering the grass in the suit, which in RSA is considered to be something almost sacred, Mandela fourteen years ago won great ovations, especially from the white public and the recognition of the white inhabitants.
The football championship will succeed in helping people unite and form a nation, mentioned rugby player Chester Williams, the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
It will still be seen, if the tense situation in the RSA improves.
White South Africans, however, are skeptical, as a rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled his country to Britain, said in an interview recently for LN.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In Lounsko burns a transformator worth tens of millions of crowns
The fire caught in the morning a transformator from the company Čeps in a switch box near the village of Výškov in Lounsko.
According to Lukáš Marvan, the spokesman for the Usti region's fire department, the fire was extinguished by six groups.
Previously, firefighters wanted to let the transformator be destroyed by the fire, but later changed their mind and the fire is being extinguished with a mixture of water, foam and a special extinguishing material.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured, according to Pavla Mandátová, the company's spokeswoman, the breakdown does not jeopardize the safe operation of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is several million crowns, listing it exactly will not be possible before the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandátová, it will be necessary to replace the destroyed transformator with a new one.
During the ten years of Čeps’ activity, nothing similar happened, such failures are sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, a spokeswoman for the ČEZ company for the Northern Czech Republic, electricity supplies were not cut, and the fire at the power station did not affect the operation of homes, offices or.
A.s. Čeps operated on the territory of the Czech Republic as an exclusive maintenance provider of the distribution system, of the electrical conduction of 400 kV and 220 kV.
Itins in good condition, renews and develops 39 switch boxes with 67 transformers, which carry the electrical energy from the transmission system to the distributor system, andins the electrical conduct of 4339 kilometers long.
Jančura will file a complaint for slander against three ČSSD hetmans
Student Agency owner Radim Jančura today will file a complaint for slander against three social-democratic hetmans.
They are Michal Hašek of the Jihomoravský kraj region, Radko Martínek of Pardubický kraj and the hetman of Olomoucký kraj Martin Tesařík.
Jančura mentioned it in Twenty Minutes in Radiožurnál.
The demand has to do with the company’s effort to maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions, however, ended up signing long-term contracts with České dráhy.
All three hetmans are attacking us and talking about the fact that we are “taking the pastel passes,” but we brought only the offer for what they themselves wanted.
They say that we are more expensive than České dráhy, which is not true.We know the prices of České dráhy, which were set last week.
We have nothing but to defend ourselves.
It is for the slander towards the Student Agency society, he told Radiožurnál Jančura.
He noted at the same time having the tests of all regions. according to him they have not taken necessary measures in harmony with European law.
Therefore, it is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Hašek considers this complaint the continuation of Mr. Jančura’s media show, which serves as free advertising for his company and for himself.
Of course, I am prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region and I appeal to the other Hetmans to do so too.
I suppose, which will also be clearly demonstrated on this occasion, that Mr. Jančura is manipulating the public in the matter of regional rail transport, and uses false and false arguments, Hašek mentioned.
Jančura announced last week that he would invest several million crowns in advertising, whose goal would be to warn regions of these measures.
He told Radiožurnál that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue it after the New Year.
He said the campaign would be aimed at combating corruption.
Jančura began the campaign after the regions agreed with České dráhy to maintain regional rail links and for the order of approximately 150 billion crowns did not call for a tender.
According to Jančura, similar steps are inconsistent with the law and with the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
Jančura claims to have been threatened by a ČSSD deputy, due to his criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was, that if we don’t leave it, we could lose the bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the ČSSD, I know, of what lord it is, I will not say his name, Jančura said today to Radiožurnál.
Pneumoccal vaccination will be free and voluntary
Pneumococcal vaccination from January will put an end to the usual custom.
As a first vaccination, it should be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, there are already opinions that the mandatory vaccine would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free pneumococcal vaccine are culminating.
The Institute of Medicines is already setting the maximum prices for vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
Experts already have this clear in the procedure of vaccination.
The new vaccine
Free vaccines for children born in August
Children born after August 2 may receive the pneumococal vaccine free of charge.
The condition is that you have not received a single dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started with the vaccine last year or earlier, have to cover other doses of the vaccine as well.
The first dose of the vaccine must be given between the third and fifth months of age of the child.
Last year, a quarter of families volunteered to vaccinate their children against pneumococci.
The parents, however, paid for a dose of 1600 crowns and more.
To vaccinate younger children, four doses are needed.
Generally, experts estimate, insurance companies will spend on vaccines from 300 to 450 thousand crowns annually.
No embryos will save on treatment, which is needed for unvaccinated children.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 a year on all children’s vaccinations.
The covered vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcus is the cause of otitis media, but also of serious infections including meningitis and septicemia.
From pneumococal infections in our country every year die according to research in hospitals 28 children not older than 10 years of age.
In addition to the Czech Republic, the covered pneumococcal vaccine in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Is vaccination mandatory?
However, there are also opinions that this vaccine could be mandatory in the future.
From January, it must be covered by insurance companies and volunteer.
Compulsory vaccination would be better, said Rudolf Kalovský, head of the Nahlas civic association.
His association has been spreading pneumococal vaccines for a long time.
Experts at an international conference, in which our association participated, were not completely satisfied with the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It is not entirely ideal.
We are happy to have at least achieved this.
I think this is the path we now have to take, Kalovský said.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the procedure for pneumococcal vaccination.
At this time we are not thinking about it at all, said its spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, say doctors
The president of the society of pediatricians Odborná společnost praktických dětských lékařů Hana Cabrnochová acknowledges that the voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages.
“In the situation, when the vaccine costs such a high amount, we relatively understand the political decision to have initiated vaccination as voluntary,” says Cabrnochová.
Experts expect, that from next year, more than 80 percent of young parents leave their babies vaccinated against pneumococci.
The pneumococal vaccine is a big change also because as the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, to save on treatment, Cabrnochová explains.
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines for themselves.
However, pediatricians are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be bought by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just like when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some MPs, however, feared that insurance companies could “pull out health insurance money.”
Doctors therefore will have to buy the vaccines and wait, until they are paid by the insurance companies.
It is estimated that pediatricians will invest 40,000 a month in vaccines, which is a remarkable sum.
It won’t be easy, says Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved "in the theft of a museum"
The son of renowned American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been accused of trying to steal paintings valued at $20 million (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
Pennsylvania police say Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught while carrying 90 pictures in his vehicle and trailer.
They say Frazetta and another man used a excavator to plunge into the museum, in the Pocono Mountains region.
Frazetta father, 81, is famous for his representation of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
The Associated Press that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP that an unidentified police official claimed that a family dispute may have motivated the young Frazetta.
The agency that Frazatta son, 52, declared to the police that his father had ordered him "to enter the museum by any means to transfer all the paintings to a depot."
The agency said Frazetta father denied having granted such permission.
The Labour Party defends tax increases in the budget
The ministers have defended tax increases and spending cuts in the prior budget report, facing criticism from the opposition, and unions.
Conservatives said Alistair Darling "missed" an opportunity to show his seriousness on deficit cuts, delaying decisions until after the elections.
The Minister of Finance also received harsh criticism for harming low- and middle-income workers.
The main proposals include an increase of 0.5% in Social Security spending and a top of 1% in public sector salary agreements from 2011.
Cholera for Social Security
Trade unions have lamented that low-wage workers are punished with a recession generated by others, and warned of future “problems.”
The increase in Social Security spending, which will grow around £3 billion a year, has angered the business community, which claims this is a job tax, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those earning more than £20,000 a year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
Key points of the report before the budget
Social Security with an additional 0.5% increase, from April 2011
Economy will contract more than expected 4.75% this year
50% tax on bankers’ bonds
1 point increase in corporate tax for small firms
Tax deductions for electric cars and wind turbines
The state pension would rise by 2.5%
According to the Ministry of Finance estimates, a person who earns £30,000 will lose £90 a year and whoever earns £40,000 will lose £190, while a person who earns £10,000 a year will earn £110.
The ministers said their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 involved “difficult decisions,” but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would fall on 5% of the higher wages.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the tax hikes and cut-offs outlined were "a grain of sand in the desert" compared to what was needed.
“This will allow us to halve the deficit, which is absolutely essential over the next four years,” he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident the economy would grow again by the end of the year.
However, Labour’s forecasts for future economic growth, which will influence the amount to be borrowed and the speed with which the deficit is reduced, have been questioned after the Minister of Finance was forced to modify the first figures.
In his statement, he said the economy would likely shrink by 4.75% this year, far worse than the 3.5% decline forecasted in April, while the loan request would be £3 billion higher than previously estimated.
“A Missed Opportunity”
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday, warning of Labour’s “debt crisis,” said the forecast for a £789 billion loan application for the next six years was unsustainable.
The Ministers had failed to present a credible plan on how they would return the money, they added, "cynically" evading the difficult options until after the elections to be held in June 2010.
“They’ve included nothing significant about what they’re going to do,” said Minister in the shadow of the Treasury Ministry, Philip Hammond. “They’ve had the opportunity to do it and they’ve wasted it.”
“All important announcements will be made after the elections, win whoever wins.”
by Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour Party insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, unlike conservative proposals, which would seek a greater reduction of the deficit in the short term.
But Liberal Democrats argued that the money raised from tax increases and spending cuts would be used to sustain next year’s spending, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the projects were like “sand castles.”
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the time chosen for the announcements, such as the rise in inflation of some of the above-mentioned April next year’s disability subsidies, would leave the Treasury Minister exposed to allegations of election maneuvers, as the money could simply be recovered the following year.
However, the Labour Party insists that it is providing the people with the most they need and will review the situation in September 2010.
“Fake budget”
Although ministers did not publish spending data after 2011, economists said it was clear that the adjustment of public spending would only be felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute of Fiscal Studies said the Minister’s figures involved substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including in the future transport, higher education, science and defence.
“This is really postponing the pain for later,” said its director, Robert Chote.
“All important announcements will come after the election, win whoever wins,” said Roger Bootle, financial consultant for Deloitte’s accountants.
“This has been the fake report before the budget.
FBI investigates “US detainees in Pakistan”
The FBI is investigating the detention in Pakistan of five American men suspected of extremist connections.
The U.S. embassy in Pakistan told the BBC that the men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in eastern Punjab province.
The FBI has said it is investigating whether they are the same men who disappeared from their homes in the state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Foreign Ministry said it was also looking for information about the men.
It is that three of them are of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian inheritance and the other of Yemeni origin.
"If they are U.S. citizens, of course we will be very interested in the charges for which they have been detained and in what kind of circumstances they are being detained," spokesman Ian Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
“We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if in fact these are the students who were missing,” the spokeswoman said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were arrested in a house belonging to one of their uncles.
He said the house was already in the eye of the local police and that no charges had yet been filed against the detainees.
Foreign Secretary Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, Reuters, but said the U.S. had to "work closer with both Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to eradicate the terrorist infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people."
The families of the five students their disappearance in North Virginia in late November.
Amnesty International condemns Iranian “abuse”
Human rights in Iran over the past 20 years have always been equally poor, according to a report by the campaign group Amnesty International.
The report details the regime’s “abuse models” before and after the June presidential elections.
One man cited in the report said they had beaten him and burned him with cigarettes, while another said they threatened to rape him.
Iran has rejected previous criticism of its human rights history.
Officials have said that such criticisms have a political basis.
Thousands of people arrested and dozens killed in Iran after the election held by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sparked the biggest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens of people have been convicted, and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
BBC correspondent in Tehran, Jon Leyne, who is now in London, says that during the protests, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Jamenei acknowledged some allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the detention center in Kahrizak.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance for criticism, according to our correspondent.
“False Confession”
Amnesty International quoted Ebrahim Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer student, as saying he was accused of “working with Facebook networks” and protesting the election outcome.
“They often hit me in the face,” he said.
“They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, in my head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me.”
Amnesty said that after five days he signed a false confession and was released and abandoned on the street, still bleeding and semi-conscious.
In August, defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said some protesters arrested after the election had been tortured to death in prison, and others had been raped.
Iranian officials denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that there had been abuses.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee, who said he was held in a container along with 75 other people for more than eight weeks, in a detention center in Kahrizak.
Amnesty recognized that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had set up committees to investigate post-election unrest and the government’s response, but said the mandate and powers of the agencies were confusing and the parliamentary committee’s findings had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been arrested in the last three weeks, to prevent further protests.
A ski resort was built in the city park.
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a Bristol site into a racing course.
The Pista at the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump ramp, opposite a 100-meter-long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the track, but that it was pretty frightening.
You can see beneath a beautiful view of the lighting city lights.
Here are some of the county’s best skiers and snowboarders, real talent,” he added.
Awards were awarded to the best tricks or manoeuvres performed on the track.
After the event on Thursday afternoon, the snow will melt.
Still them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have sought to ban the construction of minarets and where there is a widespread warning about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, a U.S. academic, has written a detailed report and studied the possible integration of Muslims (who are actually being integrated) into one of the most openly secular societies on the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author’s latest work “Why the French Don’t Like Headcarves” (2006), an elegant and detailed study of a problem that divided and concerned the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still perceived today.
Mr. Bowen’s latest book has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide the 5-6 million Muslims of France with what Mr. Bowen calls “Islamic spaces.”
He is a good listener who reproduces debates between teachers and students on the questions that most interest them.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in a town hall (or both)?
Should they teach young Muslims about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use a interest-based banking system to obtain a mortgage?
It is these seemingly worldly issues, he says, things of everyday life that concern the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, professors and intellectuals, none of them renowned, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim academic and scholar born in Switzerland.
This new generation tries to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They cannot spread this argument fully.
Conservatives only doubt the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists Mr. Bowen interviews tend to disagree with his Salafi counterparts, supporters of purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen thinks that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
It questions to what extent French political strategists (and the intellectual elite that so fiercely defends secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
It suggests that Muslims are probably treated more unfairly than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, who have also had to make their historical commitments to secular republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, he perceives “a adjustment of values.”
After reading this book, one tends to say “Yes, but not yet.”
The most desolate panorama in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting at an alarming speed, carrying life with it that cannot survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, transport and fisheries have been focused on recently open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a consequence of this.
In “On Thin Ice” Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural story of the icon of the north, the polar bear.
Knowing the complicated history and politics of whale hunting, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers, who proved their courage by confronting the white bear.
The encounter of Admiral Nelson as a brave 14-year-old cadet, struggling only with the end of his mosquito, is a myth, but others are true.
The offspring, caught while swimming following the bodies of their newly exterminated mothers, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus presentation in the early 20th century showed 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, zoological gardens are still generally one millionth of the area of a wild adult's environment.The climate is almost never suitable: a polar bear resident in Singapore is greened by algae growing within the hairless zones of its fur.

Ellis turns to accounts from other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of species.
Although it is prohibited in Norway, the US and Russia, the slaughter continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and motorcycle Indians use high-power assault rifles to destroy their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of those two hunter nations where the ice will last for the longest.
In his new book, After the Ice, Alun Anderson, a former New Scientist editor, offers a clear and frightening account of Arctic science and an overwhelming look at how the future of that place can be transformed.
Scientists don’t have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of changes.
It is not a lack of effort.
Fridtjof Nansen’s pioneering journeys in the late 19th and early 20th centuries gave for the first time clues about the displacement of ice masses.
Then the Cold War submarines drew a map of the moved ice cords that circulate beneath the ice masses.
Satellite exploration and extensive series of iceberg mounted probes are a useful supplement, but resistant individuals camped in the cold still perform a lot of tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks inside the extraordinary, tiny world of the affluent system within the Arctic ice, formed by jets of saltwater that compresses as it freezes.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders inside, they’re all doomed once the summer ice is removed, which is thought to happen somewhere between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months...these could be us.
Marines among the 6,000 who place crowns on Arlington tombs
Pfc. De'Angello Robinson, 19, travelled seven hours in a bus to place a single crown on the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate tombs, it was a day to pay tribute to men and women who once stood in their boots.
In a few months, from where they are embarking on us, these could be us, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If it’s us, I’d like someone to do the same for me, so I just try to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to place crowns on veteran graves in various sections of Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Crown Company in Harrington, Maine, started the event when he and other people decided to decorate several hundred tombs at the Arlington Cemetery.
In what is already a 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the trip every year stopping in different cities along the way, to officiate events dedicated to military and terror victims.
The Worcester also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has spread the event to other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on Arlington Cemetery tombs, areas in the Pentagon, tombs at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, the Battery Park in New York City, and the United Airlines Flight 93 commemorative site in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased military officer.
As long as her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said this was her way of giving a reward to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way civilians can support our troops, he said.
It’s like visiting a family tomb.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothes, the volunteers walked through the vast prairies and hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers headed to older tombs from World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War, because they do not receive as many visits as the new tombs, organizers said.
The atmosphere was cheerful as the children played and the couples took their hands, while carrying the fresh pine to the tombs.
Each circular crown was of deep green, with a small red lace tied on the top.
Near there, Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the shady atmosphere of current wars invaded the area.
People cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends supported each other in the ice air.
Some read loud names carved on the stones, while others bowed to see small white and black plates placed inside the wet clay, for those whose bricks have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who swept their tears in front of her son’s tomb.
He travelled eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of Navy artillery Sgto. David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free. . . my son paid for it, he said.
“Long after my death I want someone to remember it.”
Cuban officers arrest U.S. government contractor
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who distributed mobile phones and laptops in the country, State Department officials said on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc, based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the United States Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials along with the U.S. Section of Interests in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on December 5.
The specific charges have not been made public, although according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything that is considered “dangerous.”
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, which include mild protests and critical writings, involve the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has an incipient blogger community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has requested permission on several occasions to leave the country to accept prizes, but the permission has been denied.
The arrest of an American contractor may likely spark tensions between the communist government of the Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been looking for a "slow-paced" approach to improve relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to report the arrest on Friday night.
The new US policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete measures, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for the opposition, there will be reciprocity on the part of the United States.
Mobile phones and laptops are legal in Cuba, even though they are new and coveted products in a country where the average salary of a government worker is $15 a month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones only this year; they are mainly used for text messages, as a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost the daily salary.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign hotel visitors, and in some government establishment, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect, often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer at the U.S. Section of Interests in Havana, said that most of the handful of U.S. citizens in Cuba’s prison are in bars for crimes like drug trafficking.
Berbena said he could not provide more information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other open society, such as sharing mobile phones for free, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the program for the Americas of Human Rights Watch, who recently published a tough report on freedoms in Cuba, called “New Castro, Cuba itself,” a reference to Raul Castro’s placement as the country’s leader, to replace his sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the accused are often arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned in one day.
He pointed out that any solution would likely be political, and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries begin to have more dialogue.
Pakistan officials unleash conspiracy to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities neutralized the brain of a conspiracy to send five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying they hope the case could help dismantle an extensive network of terrorist recruits, who surf the internet in search of radicalized young people.
Investigators said they were chasing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the YouTube video site.
Saifullah directed the men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan’s tribal belt, which is a familiar place for al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who had been informed about the case said on Saturday Saifullah was unable to convince al-Qaeda commanders that the men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
Consequently, they were isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, away from the imposing mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were seen as part of a covert operation.
For this reason they were rejected, the official said, who spoke from the anonymity due to the delicacy of the case.
The official said the men did not immutate themselves and were even trying to get appropriate approval to access al-Qaeda camps when Pakistani police arrested them.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI, underscores the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, most importantly, determining who are trusted.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, U.S. intelligence has made it a top priority to try to infiltrate people within al Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, not letting pass those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to the holy war, and those who could be spies.
Analysts said al-Qaeda is looking with special attention at aspiring American recruits.
But for the organization they represent a huge attraction, due to their potential to have access to U.S. targets and due to their propaganda value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst for the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years with regard to who they admit, because U.S. intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you’re trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed,” Kohlmann said.
It has become a much more web-based model.
Thousands protest in Copenhagen demanding climate action
On Saturday, tens of thousands of protesters marched here on the streets demanding negotiators working at the city’s Bella Center Convention Center to take more bold action for the climate.
Protesters said 100,000 people took part in the event, but police estimated the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On a day when little happened in the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked around the city holding signatures in English that said “There is no planet B” and one in Spanish that declared, “The Earth says “it’s enough.”
Several celebrities joined the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said traveling to Peru, her mother’s home country, made me aware of the distressing issues the country has to deal with due to the impacts of climate change that are already happening.”
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to world leaders to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way to avoid it for longer.
Police prevented protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center, and said they had arrested 19 people, mostly for wearing masks or wearing pocket knives.
According to Danish law, those activities are prohibited during the demonstrations.
According to a witness, who asked not to be identified for being involved in the climate talks, activists wearing sports masks and black clothes placed several explosives near the Copenhagen main channel, which is close to several ministries.
They were around the buildings, he said, adding that they started as flames, but were followed by “a couple of large explosions.”
Within the convention center, people gathered around TV screens to watch the march throughout the afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to penetrate the consciousness of key officials such as Su Wei, China’s chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, “I really wasn’t aware of the situation.”
Then he went on to say in Mandarin, “As the meeting place is big, I can’t hear what’s going on outside.”
He pointed out that it depended on the perspective of each to determine whether the march was being harmful or beneficial.
He said this shows the attention of the general public and different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, "it can also be said that they affect negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
Data from a test reveals persistent racial differences
Last week’s federal score booklet on performance in mathematics was very good news for the capital district’s public schools.
Although the District is still far from the country’s best-performing systems, the rating book showed that fourth- and eighth-grade students have kicked off at a faster rate over the past two years, compared to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains recorded in recent figures from the National Education Progress Assessment is the persistent performance difference between African-American and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average scores of white fourth grade D.C. students over the past two years grew from 262 to 270 (on a 500 scale), but their African American peers increased only three points, from 209 to 212.
In fact, the performance difference grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the eighth degree African Americans remained essentially fixed, dropping a statistically insignificant point, from 245 to 244.
The average white scores were not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
Over the course of a six-year extension, the picture is no more encouraging.
The difference that separated white and black fourth grade students in 2003, when the first ENPE was announced in the District, was 60 points on the scale (262 to 202).
Although the scores achieved by the children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has barely reduced to 58.
Some education lawyers in the District expressed concern last week, as the advances celebrated by Rector Michelle A. El Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat), were driven largely by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the overall by serving those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit organization advocating educational equity in the District.
I’m not jumping out of joy for a difference of two or three points, said D.C. Board member Kwame R. Brown (Dem.-By accumulation), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of the Eaton Elemental.
Brown, a stubborn critic of Rhee’s management style, said the message from the test scores is that the city’s secondary schools have a desperate need for attention.
Clearly they always want to see the positive signs, and I respect it.
But what worries is that we are not spending the time or energy needed for our middle schools.
Rhee said the District needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-performing students.
This fall, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students of the upper primary and middle school degrees, who have not mastered the foundations of early reading in their school courses and are considerably behind their peers.
All-Day Maths, a math curriculum from kindergarten to sixth grade, emphasizing real-life games and experiences, was introduced to the District under former superintendent Clifford Janey, who is credited with some of the progress by ENPE last week.
I just think we have to continue to work to offer the best interventions to those students who are below the degree level, Rhee said.
Others say the ENPE results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for low-performing schools, which will be needed to reduce the gap.
Here’s a kind of scabroso dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, who studies urban test scores.
The solution of conventional policy is to allocate its resources and administration reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of the D.C.
Then the goal can generate political repercussions that go against that important timetable.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban superintendents, she tries to cling to the black and white middle class.
Our focus is on ensuring that we build an excellent school system.
We must strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, no matter where they live, have confidence that their children can access excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of Newark’s schools, said in an interview this week that an essential element to end the performance difference is to extend the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with autonomous schools.
It takes almost 200 days to have the force of change, Janey said, who reached an agreement with the union of his teachers last year on a year of 185 days, which he considers as a “indicator” to seek a greater increase in the next convention.
Making Higher Education a Part of the Future
The tourist bus arrived at the University of Gettysburg with a strong resolve.
Graciela Rodríguez, 12, came down and blinked for a moment in front of the white columns, brick façades and emerald prairies.
Graciela’s parents had barely graduated from a high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Still, when she and the other eighth grade students of the group explored Gettysburg, where tuition costs $38,690 a year, her attitude was less that of impressed guests than that of enthusiastic potential students.
Here is where I will be! exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the science building.
“Carey, seriously,” he thought thoughtfully, when the guide spoke of the school’s low teacher-student ratio.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that the kids had visited on their three-day trip, and they had already completely absorbed their deliberate message: The question is not whether you will go to college.
The question is which.
Although there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Hispanic immigrants who abandon secondary school or get pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands who access the university education they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these "second-generation" Hispanics graduates from university, a remarkable achievement given that many of their immigrant parents, especially Mexican and Central American, entered the United States without finishing secondary school.
Their success stories are important, the researchers say, because they indicate the path to follow for a generation that will play a major role in the country’s workforce.
Those who analyze those with higher performance say they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to offset their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But tutoring programs can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of kids like her get to college, especially if the efforts are sustained over time.
Observing low-income children, whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, deduces that any intervention at any time will not fix it, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latin students.
We have to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that financed the tour of Graciela universities is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems, to run university preparation programs, which start when low-income students are in high school and continue until they finish high school.
Since 1999, the program has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent attending university, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi oil ministry reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its fragile infrastructure, during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum has reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play a leading role in restoring Iraq’s oil industry, mutilated by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies drove away by jumping in only two of the 10 auctioned sites.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began Friday.
The only one who made an offer lost.
Two U.S. companies reached agreements for auctioned sites in June.
The poor representation of U.S. oil giants in the opening of Iraq’s oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of U.S. companies, there are Asians and Europeans at the head, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraqi Oil Forum, an online news center.
It will take a long time before anything else is available in Iraq.
Security concerns, accentuated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as U.S. military forces withdraw, likely prevented U.S. oil companies from taking more vigorous risks in Iraq, which has the world’s third-largest reserve of crude, analysts said.
U.S. companies were in some cases at a disadvantage, because rivals, in particular Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have considerably lower labor costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc were the only U.S. companies to reach agreements with the ministry.
Major U.S. firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have tightened ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and provided technical advice in recent years, have left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese state-owned National Petroleum Corporation offered more contracts than any other company and made large investments in contracts for two major sites.
We know that China is on its way to becoming a major economic and technological powerhouse, said Assam Jihad, a spokesman for the Ministry of Petroleum.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be up to date with its competitors and will fulfill its commitments toward Iraq.
The companies preselected to submit proposals made bids that then confronted the barrel subsidy that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above current levels in each landfill.
Al-Qaeda Planner Murdered in Pakistan
An alleged U.S. missile attack on Pakistan’s border with Afghanistan is believed to have killed a leading al-Qaeda operations planner this week, U.S. counterterrorism officials said Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men thought to have died on Tuesday when a pair of missiles hit his car, near the city of Miran Shah, in the North Waziristan province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were fired by an unidentified plane, of the type operated by the CIA within the illegal tribal zone of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, in the direction of the Afghan border, when the car was hit, a Pakistani civil intelligence agency official said, speaking by phone from Miran Shah.
The official said the suspected local militants rushed to the site and quickly confiscated what remained of the “totally destroyed bodies.”
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somalia was among the dead.
He described Somali as a senior al-Qaeda military planner, who directed the terrorist group’s operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He dedicated himself to conspiring around the world, a senior official said, who spoke from the anonymity, citing the delicate nature of U.S. airstrikes within Pakistani territory.
Considering their central role, this probably included conspiracy attacks against the United States and Europe.
It had strategic guidance from al-Qaeda’s top command and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said Somalia had rapidly risen into the ranks of al-Qaeda and was well connected with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a known name for some Americans, but that does not in any way diminish the threat it posed to us and our allies, the second official said.
If his death is confirmed, Somalia would be the second al-Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal zone, and three other high-ranking agents.
The rate of CIA-led unmanned aircraft attacks has decreased since summer, from an average of about six operations a month to two, according to a recall from The Long War Journal, a website run by a non-profit organization.
The decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while mercilessly killing suspected whistleblowers, the site said.
UN envoy to Kabul to resign
The highest UN envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign in March, ending a tumultuous term that was damaged by allegations of widespread corruption in the UN-backed Afghan presidential election.
The departure of Eide happens when the Obama administration has decided to send some 30,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. envoy said he supports the increase, but is concerned that the U.S. timetable for military withdrawal starting in 18 months will push other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the preparation of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghan people so that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian officials, to collaborate with Afghanistan’s political transition.
The increase in the military sector has to be reflected in the civil sector, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008 to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the secretary.
UN General Ban Ki-moon, so that he had time to find a replacement.
What I’ve said is that it’s better that they start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I arrived here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor’s departure and my arrival.
Ban has begun looking for a replacement, according to UN officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently headed the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously headed UN peacekeeping missions.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested by his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favouring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential vote and covering evidence of mass electoral fraud.
Eide denied the accusations, but said Galbraith's accusations, who were fired, "certainly damaged the mission, because there was already much skepticism as to international interference" in the election.
Eide said he proposed the appointment of a senior civil representative to coordinate assistance efforts by U.S.-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also pushed the leadership of the UN to allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries, which lend to the Afghan mission, claiming that this would increase their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide expressed his frustration over the limitations of his powers in Afghanistan, arguing that the UN’s cumbersome hiring regulations undermined his ability to capture talent.
That’s how the UN rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
This is catastrophic and cannot continue.
Gates: Iran will face additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran for its failure to engage in talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking to a group of approximately 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq, during a week-long trip to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, disregarded the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he argued, in response to a soldier’s question about the probability of such an event.
One of the things that weighs on me is that if we’ve learned something from Iraq over the last six years, it’s the inherent unpredictability of the war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions targeting Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population in general.
He said it would be necessary “a package of incentives and disincentives,” “to persuade the Iranian government that they would really be less secure with nuclear weapons,” because “his people will suffer tremendously” the sanctions.
On Friday, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, in a statement, joined the administration with European leaders to warn that Iran will face "credible" consequences if its nuclear program does not fully comply with the instructions of the UN Security Council and its nuclear control body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on October 1, he indicated that he would re-negotiate on the restriction of his nuclear program and would agree to leave a substantial part of his reserve of enriched uranium, in exchange for the fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement, as a way to build trust between the two sides and gain time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to have stepped away from the tentative deals, in part, experts say, because Iranian command is divided about the possibility of compromising with the United States.
Frankly, I think Iran’s hardening with the international community over some proposals that they actually accepted in early October has united the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way they have not been in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set a deadline on December 31 for Iran to respond to the proposals, before rethinking other options, including continuing with what Foreign Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "devastating sanctions."
In a statement in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called "unfounded and unfounded allegations" by some members of the Security Council about Iran's nuclear activities, and said it is willing to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers, "in order to an appropriate, long-term solution."
Gates, who was scheduled to return to Washington on Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region of Iraq to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Iraqi Arab majority, with regard to borders, property rights and co-participation.
Gates urged both sides to decrease the potential for the conflict, to avoid any delay in U.S. projects to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
U.S. officials quoted Gates' words to Massoud Barzani, President of the Regional Government of Kurdistan: "We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon them.”
In an ageing China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that preached about the fact that "Mother Earth is too tired to support more children" and "a baby more means a tomb more."
They learned the lesson so well that, when Shanghai government officials, alarmed by the low birth rate and the aging population of their city, suddenly shifted course this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instant and firm: In no way.
We’ve given all our time and energy to just one child.
“We have nothing left for a second,” said 31-year-old Wang, a human resource manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the one-child policy was introduced in China, creating two generations of notoriously rejected children, miscreated single children, affectionately nicknamed "little emperors", a demographic crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate has dropped to 1.8 children per couple, compared to six when the policy became effective, according to the Division.
UN demographic, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is forecast to explode from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050.
The imbalance is worse in rich coastal cities with very cult populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for 22 percent of registered residents of Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of Shanghai’s Family Planning and Municipal Population Commission, said fertile couples should have babies to “help reduce the proportion of the aging population and mitigate future labor shortages.”
Shanghai is about to be “as old (not as rich, however) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden,” he said.
A gradual relief
Redacted in the country’s constitution in 1978, China’s one-child policy is possibly the most controversial mandate introduced to date by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate policy face enormous fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and labor discrimination.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for its contribution to avoiding critical pressure on its natural resources, while human rights defenders have denounced abuses in policy imposition.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have made abortions according to the sex of the fetus, leading to a high unnatural male-woman ratio.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually softened their stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife are single children, and in 2007 they mitigated many of their hardline slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Beijing University’s Institute for Demographic Research, said central government officials have recently been discussing even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost night by morning, the posters that ordered families to have a single child were replaced by copies of regulations that detailed who would be suitable for having a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples in their homes and slide brochures under the doors.
It has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say the response has been very little overwhelming.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural city outside Shanghai claim that they have seen a moderate increase in applications from couples who want a second child after the campaign launched, the more urban districts do not indicate any change.
The municipality of Huinan, for example, with a population of 115,000, is still receiving only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai say that despite the campaign, the city’s birth toll in 2010 is still forecast to reach only around 165,000, slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Caolu municipality’s family planning committee in Shanghai, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don’t want more children.
They want to give her the best for her first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally entitled to do so.
But like many Chinese, they only have insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social protection network, they argue, this option would be irresponsible.
People in the West incorrectly see the one-child policy as a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple’s first child.
Yes, they are stealing us the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It is money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resource manager, said she wanted a single child because she too was: “We were the center of our families and we were used to everyone taking care of us.
We’re not used to taking care of others and we really don’t want to take care of others.”
42-year-old Chen Zijian, owner of a translation agency, explained this in a more vivid way.
For middle-class parents with two careers that reduce the birth rate, he said, it’s about being successful enough to be selfish.
People between the ages of 20 and 30 grew up watching their parents struggle during the early days of China’s experiment with capitalism and they don’t want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child requires a lot of time from parents, he argued.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space issues, “they have to remodel their apartment,” and the strategist “have to have a resume ready for the best kindergartens when the child is 9 months old.”
Most of his friends are willing to face this once, Chen said, but not two.
We are the first generation with the highest standard of living.
We do not want to make too many sacrifices.
A UN group outlines a plan to reduce emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference, so far characterized by challenging positions and mutual reproaches, captured renewed attention on Friday with the disclosure of a document that predicts ambitious reductions in greenhouse gas emissions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations carrying on their shoulders most of the burden in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the path to follow.
But it was seen as a major step forward in a negotiation that is leaving out of time, with more than 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week.
Elaborated by an ad hoc UN working group, the text does not speak of how much money rich countries would give to the poor to tackle global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how developed economies and major emerging economies would cut their coal output, and what would be the limit of the global temperature rise that policy strategists would be willing to tolerate.
This gives a lot of flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, a senior representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, summed up a 180-page negotiation text to focus on what the top UN climate official, Yvo de Bóer, described as “the great panorama.”
It shows the profiles for a possible agreement, in which industrialized nations would collectively cut their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to the 1990 levels, while major developing countries would reduce their emissions during the same period by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, countries would cut emissions between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also boosted talks on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion annually over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
Anyway, on Friday, the same kind of verbal fireworks were presented that have dominated conversations last week.
U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Change, Todd Stern, has rejected claims calling for mandatory cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries, compared to volunteers from some of the major emerging economies, if they weren’t funded by the developed world.
The exercise indicated that the Obama administration is adopting a tougher line with China, compared to what Bush administration officials did just two years ago.
The United States will not make an agreement without major developing countries moving forward and taking action, Stern said, who also lamented that the text did not do enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei claimed that the top U.S. climate negotiator lacked "common sense," or was "very irresponsible" for saying earlier in the week that the U.S. would not help China economically cope with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the world’s major powers at stake, the fault lines have erupted both within the developing world, as well as between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States facing over their respective obligations, while the poorer nations insist that the world’s twenty-four most influential countries are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the most courageous action.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rica delegate, said it’s not surprising that major powers are discussing who should pay for the expenses to limit greenhouse gases, even as vulnerable countries have become more aggressive trying to contain the big emitters responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is developing, Ulate argued, who also works as regional adviser on climate change for Mexico and Central America, for International Conservation.
Some of the most vulnerable countries to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the key participants say the talks will ultimately produce a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, drafted a 24-page preliminary treaty early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said the push of small island nations has "set political pressure on the entire political process," in part because they are now unified and demand action from emerging economies, such as China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most exceptional issues before the heads of government reached a deal.
High-level officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese deputy minister, came down from the planes and ran to the Bella Center corridors for closed-door meetings and press conferences to delineate claims to be arbitrated over the next week.
The absolute disorder of the meeting (where every day 13,000 people enter and leave the convention center, the activists who play the guitar present nighttime shows mocking the countries that they say are being sold, and preliminary proposals are passed hand in hand instead of via mail), poses a challenge.
The intensity only builds: almost all key ministers are here at this time, and on Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, vice president for global policy at Conservation International.
The heavy weights are coming.
Britain’s first 225 km/h train redefines Monday’s feeling
At 5.13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whirlwind will blow through the dark to signal a train departure that marks a revolution for travel in Britain.
The country’s first interurban high-speed train will reach 225 km/h, when it passes like a lightning from Ashford, Kent, to London’s St Panrcas station, covering 93 kilometers in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Transport Secretary, will then be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes on board the first Javelin interurban service outside of London.
He expects the new service will finally connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the major conurbancies of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected remote areas would become thriving suburbs, business travel times would be shortened and the shift of planes and cars to the railway would reduce domestic coal emissions, as well as alleviate road congestion.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears about environmental damage, can still curb Britain’s high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the government with a feasibility study, will deliver its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, the Times said.
This will provide you with a detailed itinerary of the next planned step for the high-speed network.
The new line that connects London to the Midlands of the West will be drawn within a radius of five meters in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact can be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn within a radius of 25 meters of a definitive route.
HS2 is also expected to set three options for a wider high-speed network heading north.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The preferred option being proposed is an Y-shaped configuration, in which a single high-speed line would reach the West Midlands.
The line would be divided into or near Birmingham, with one branch heading west from the Penins to Manchester and Scotland, and another to the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
Only one line would enter Scotland.
“It seems that this will be the most beneficial option,” said a railway member.
Once completed, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to just over an hour today.
The proposals would allow the trains to travel at 402 km/h, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The start line is being designed to support 400-metre-long trains, capable of carrying 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a London-Birmingham line.
This means that a London terminal would be needed capable of receiving 20,000 passengers per hour.
Considering the capital’s space restrictions, an existing station is expected to be expanded to fit the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts argue that only St Pancras International or Euston stations offer this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce if he believes the scheme should proceed, but extensive public consultation and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be made until after a general election.
Even if you start the work, the network would have to be built in sections.
At first, trains would be forced to leave the fast lines on existing tracks north of Birmingham, keeping travel times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is considered the crucial point necessary to ensure a shift from aircraft to trains, a benchmark for the railway revolution.
Taxpayers face mortgage for a £75,000 orange from a Conservative
Alan Duncan, the Conservative Party spokesman, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of a orangutan he built in the house of his electoral district.
The party’s prison spokesman, who was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that MPs were living “from rations,” increased his mortgage by £75,000 to build a oak-framed extension in his second home in Rutland.
They allowed him to charge the taxpayer the additional interest, adding hundreds of pounds a month.
House officials approved the applications at the time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who conducts a review of members’ expenses.
Mr. Duncan, one of the wealthiest Members of Parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his electoral district of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have been sold for almost a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fee office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described on the plans as a “orange”.
Neighbors described it as “a greenhouse for entertainment.”
Mr. Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the increase in the loan, during a recent inquiry by the House of Commons Committee on Standards and Privileges on his previous mortgage agreements.
Last month, the committee absolved him of violating the rules, following an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a £271,406 mortgage from his London property to the house of his electoral district, which he had bought in 1991, the year before becoming MP.
Documents released this week show that Mr. Duncan was applying for approximately £1,400 monthly in mortgage interest, until March last year.
In April, their applications increased to more than £1,800 per month.
Mr. Duncan’s Royal Bank of Scotland mortgage rate did not change at the time, suggesting that the entire increase would finance the loan of £75,000.
The standard variable mortgage rate of the BRE fell from 7.94% in December 2007 to 4% in March this year, the type it is now.
The most recent document issued by the House of Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan was still applying for £1,250 per month in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his job as House opposition chairman in September after a covert reporter filmed him saying that MPs had to survive “of rations” after the spending scandal.
“Basically this is being nationalized, you have to live on rations and be treated like m**rda.”
He stated, “I spend my money in my garden and ask for a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask for much more, but I don’t.”
The MP, a millionaire for his former profession as a oil trader, was first questioned about his spending in May, when it turned out he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the salary office that this “could be considered excessive.”
An activist digged a hole in the shape of the pound symbol on Mr. Duncan's lawn as a protest, after it was revealed that he requested £4,000 for three years.
Last night, when asked about raising the mortgage, Mr. Duncan said, “It was for major improvements, approved both by the salary office and subsequently by Legg.”
He added: “It’s not about circumventing and offending or breaking the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the limits, according to the rules, allowed and everything.
It could not be clearer or simpler.”
Let those who have faith come, to see the calendar of the Advent of the Brighton Beach palace.
Brighton palaps have found a new momentum for the winter months in an interactive Advent calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their palapes for each December day, using flanges as their theme.
The event began on December 1st, with guests who could see the last palapa from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, with filled cakes and ponche served for free.
Chosen villas so far include Vi Tres Barcos, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and The First Christmas, where the palate presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid cleric from the diocese of Chichester and the leader of Beyond.
He stated: “We want religion to be more relevant to people, in a post-Christian society.”
“Why do we as a Church expect people to come to an odd old building?I think the Church should come to people and celebrate in exciting ways.
“The idea of the advent calendar of the palapa began as a conversation with a few friends during a dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we are trying to try and represent that through spirituality.”
Climate action in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of protesters protested on Saturday in demand of an ambitious and binding agreement to fight global warming, across the globe and in Copenhagen, where police arrested several hundred people.
Around thirty thousand people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, marched through the Danish capital in demand of an agreement that the United Nations Conference on Climate Change should reach no later than Friday.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish climate conference president, the growing climate mobilization around the world, represented by these demonstrations, has contributed to making the “political price” of a failure in Copenhagen very high.
The incidents erupted shortly after the start of the demonstration in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, broke apartments with hamsters and hamsters, an AFP reporter said.
The police intervened quickly and firmly.
Police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people in total, according to her, especially members of the "Black Blocks", ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, in April.
The coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions in which hundreds of militants were detained "without distinction", stressing that a hundred of them "were immobilized on the street on Saturday night married and sitting despite the intense cold."
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left Parliament and took to the Bella Center, headquarters of the negotiations.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to enter.
A stage was erected to welcome the invited speakers.The former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candlestick vigil.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from major European cities, but numerous Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as some Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly with celestial rainfall, responded by forming a first concentration in Copenhagen in the morning to the call of Friends of the Earth to form "blue nightmares" for "justice and for climate".
Today we take to the streets to demand compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Philippine militant of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can’t keep saying: there’s time, said Benin singer Angélique Kidjo.
In Africa, there are rivers that dry up, water streams through which you can walk like never before could have done.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalization, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "Today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific region, which brings together numerous islands very vulnerable to warming, gave the start to the protests.
According to organizers, about 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, mostly students, marched dressed in red and lining pancakes with slogans in favor of solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, as well as in Canada, hundreds of protesters have formed concentrations claiming to act vigorously against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the “350” network gathered hundreds of people, mainly in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people gathered.
The separatist Abkhazia elected president, although Georgia denounces "fraud"
On Saturday, Abkhazia, a pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia recognized by Moscow more than a year ago, elected a president; however, Tbilisi denounces "fraud."
Around 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 for control of South Ossetia, another separatist Georgian region recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17:00 GMT.
According to the officials of the Abkhazia Electoral Commission, the participation was 58% a few hours before the closing.
The first preliminary results would be announced on Saturday night.
The five running candidates, including the outgoing president, Sergueï Bagapch, categorically rejected the idea of reunification with Georgia, which disapproved of the voting scrutiny.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili "regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under total Russian occupation," said his spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladzé.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After its separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict that ended with several thousand deaths, Abkhazia tries to demonstrate by means of this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, our new era as an independent state, said Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claimed to have voted for Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the ballot table at a capital school, Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with palm trees at the entrance.
The issue of Russian domination is the central issue of the presidential election in this region with sumptuous landscapes on the shores of the Black Sea.
Large tablets show Bagapch alongside the Russian President and Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, in different places of this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, west of the country, district chief Beslan Archba warmly welcomed Russian officials who came to control the scrutiny.
In a brief ceremony, he said: “We, the people of Abkhazia, thank Moscow for its support, and very for the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope that their country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, Russian parliamentarian Alexei Ostrovsky said, raising his glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition represented in the election by former vice president Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized the agreements signed with Moscow last year, such as the one that gives Russia control of the Abkhazian railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support the current power or the opposition.
A 50% majority plus one vote is needed to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round will be held two weeks later.
Climate: Worldwide protests, incidents in Copenhagen
On Saturday, tens of thousands of people took to the streets of the world to demand an ambitious and binding agreement ahead of the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, where police, in alert, arrested more than 700 people around an imposing demonstration.
Around 30,000 people, according to police; hundreds of thousands, according to organizers, marched in the afternoon amid the cold of the Danish capital, which welcomes delegates from 193 countries until December 18, in search of an agreement that must enter into force on January 1, 2013.
The demonstration, quite peaceful, came out of Parliament and took to the Bella Center, where negotiations are underway.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center, without trying to enter.
A stage was erected to welcome the invited speakers.The former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candlestick vigil.
Instantly after the start of the demonstration, a group of hundreds of people, all dressed in black, broke apartments with bricks and hamsters, an AFP reporter said.
The police quickly surrounded them and intervened firmly, throwing several of them to the floor.
Police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, saying they were mainly members of the Black Blocks, ultraviolent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
At the end of the afternoon, a police officer was wounded in the jaw with a fist, and four cars burned near an occupied house during the incidents that led to the arrest of about twenty people, police said.
We didn’t take the extremist groups away from their eyes, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned as police helicopters flew over the area.
Most of the protesters, who arrived by bus and train from major cities in Germany, London, Amsterdam and even Milan, were of European origin.
But numerous Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present, as were some Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly with celestial rainfall, responded by forming a first concentration in Copenhagen in the morning to the call of Friends of the Earth to form "blue nightmares" for "justice and for climate".

Oxfam, along with former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, who was to head the crowd, mobilized several celebrities, including the Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Asia-Pacific region, which brings together numerous islands very vulnerable to warming, gave the start to the protests.
According to organizers, about 5,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, mostly students, demonstrated dressed in red and lining pancakes with slogans in favor of solar energy in front of the Philippine capital’s City Hall.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, hundreds of demonstrators protested against climate change.

The subject of history and geography is reinforced from the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, said in an interview to be broadcast on Sunday’s JDD that history and geography would come out “strengthened” by the reform of general secondary education, despite being removed from compulsory teaching in the second year of a bachelor’s degree.
From now on, all students of the first bachelor’s will have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Chatel.
For the Minister, "it is enough with hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the C branch is no longer a scientific branch", but "in general, it calls for the best students."
The General and Literary Teaching branches cannot be sub-frames of the C, he continues to emphasize even: "I did not hear that historians or intellectuals were indignated by having removed history and geography in secondary bachelor's in technological schools."
An IFOP poll published on Saturday in L'Humanité revealed that approximately seven Frenchmen out of ten (69%) disapproved of the government's project to eliminate compulsory history-geography teaching in secondary C. Numerous intellectuals and teachers, the left and some elected right-wing representatives also criticized this fact.
Instead, the Minister added that "there is no talk" about removing philosophy from the secondary C bachelor's program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teaching training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which sacrifices, according to them, the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year they will render an admission test that will aim at their discipline, and at the end of the year, an admission test on their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
In addition, they will practice in real conditions during the M2 year, after which they will be a first year in front of the classroom as teachers in practice.
If you do all the proposed practices prior to the contest, you will already have a great experience in front of the classroom, that is, more than 300 hours, he added.
Finally, the Minister notes that he will propose “the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education.”
He also confirmed the project to remove the school map "before 2012".
At the Higher Normal School, experts will have 15 minutes to convincingly explain climate change
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen summit, a challenge that was accepted Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, vice president of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Evolution (GIEC) invited by the Ulm Street Higher Normal School.
Jean Jouzel, also a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, inaugurated the "Ernest" conference round, a day of a series of fifteen-minute expert presentations, filmed and open to the public, an AFP reporter said.
We wanted to do something that would attract people and transmit them the desire to know more, explained in the context of the conference Edouard Hannezzo, 22, one of the organizers of this day called as the students baptized the fish from the school pond.
We selected about twenty participants from among the experts in their discipline and selected them for their charismatic side.
About global warming, "we can talk for hours, but we can also talk about key targets in minutes," Jean Jouzel told AFP, who exposed without notes, but with the help of graphics in front of about fifty people.
It’s part of our scientific role, he stressed, hoping that the public understands that “the Copenhagen conference is based on a very serious scientific expedition.”
Videos filmed during those conferences will be online on the school’s website from December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimestral pace.
Delayed payments: disgust among prison guards, action is expected
Prison guards unions called on Friday for a “general mobilization” to demand payment before year-end holidays, premiums and overtime, which was postponed for budgetary reasons.
The Penitentiary Workers’ Force (the second guard union) called on out-of-service personnel to join the demonstration on Tuesday morning in front of prisons and “block them” to denounce the theft of their possessions.
The penitentiary CGT (the 3rd trade union of the profession) calls them to “gather in general assemblies in the different prisons to a mass mobilization”, because it titles “shameful and unacceptable” the failure to pay in December for “extra hours, night premiums, Sundays and holidays” worked in October.
And the first guard union, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (Ufap/Unsa), “convocates the general mobilization (...) in order to increase discontent and fury.”
The Directorate of the Penitentiary Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that the extra hours increased a lot in 2009 and not all were accounted for, but they assure that the balance will be paid in January.
At the end of the day, the Chancellery that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the guard unions guaranteeing that the payment would be made next month.
I do not doubt the efforts made by the staff for the functioning and modernization of our prison system, the Minister of Justice writes in this letter.
I requested the Directorate of the Penitentiary Administration to immediately implement a set of measures to ensure that this situation generated by a poor assessment of the number of overtime hours does not occur again in the future.
The December salary will then be scarce, except for the management staff who enjoy the benefit of the famous premiums for functions and objectives, and who “always blame the budgetary demands,” the Ufap/Unsa deplored.
It is a real scandal, the interregional union FO of Marseille said, announcing its decision to boycott "all meetings and calls" until new order.
The staff will not come to work on the corresponding Sundays and holidays if the months of October are not paid in December, the same will happen with overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At the time when we increase tasks and missions without taking more personnel, it is more than unfortunate to dare to attack the salary of the staff, estimates the Burdeos penitentiary CGT.
According to the unions, not in all regions happens the same, as some are more fortunate than others.
But in any case, the result is not the expected, said Ufap Secretary General Jean-François Forget.
President Obama says he makes “better gifts” than he receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first family Christmas at the White House, confessed to the famous television host Oprah Winfrey that he came to a simple conclusion as to the gifts: “I make better gifts than I get.”
During a special interview that ABC will broadcast on Sunday night, the President and his wife Michelle explain how they plan to celebrate the end of the year in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the family’s little four-legged companion, will be part of the game.
Santa Claus also loves Bo, Michelle Obama said, clarifying that the dog will "of course" receive a gift, according to excerpts from the program broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreed with her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts she receives: "In no way, last year I made you beautiful gifts," she said provoking the president.
True, he was forced to admit it before answering with humor pointing to the First Lady’s pearl collar: “Who gave you that?”
During the one-hour interview, in a distracted atmosphere with the famous animator who devotedly supported Barack Obama’s presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite childhood gifts.
Barack Obama remembered a two-speed bike, as well as a basketball that his Kenyan father, who rarely saw, gave him for Christmas.
I remember that time when my father came to see us on Christmas and gave me a basketball.
Only many years later, I learned that he had given me that ball.
The first lady remembered her puppet house.
I had no idea how to organize a house, so I put all the furniture in line against the wall, rather than accommodate them around the house, however, I loved that doll house, Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday operated again, RTL says he is in induced coma
Johnny Hallyday was intervened again in Los Angeles due to important "lesions" derived from an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his neighbors, while RTL says the singer was subjected to a coma induced to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old was again intervened on the night of Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles where some doctors checked "lesions derived from the operation" of a disc hernia carried out in Paris on November 26, his press service in that same city said, indicating that such injuries "needed a repair operation".
However, the singer's press service tried to convey tranquility saying the situation was "under control," and that a new medical department would communicate within the next 48 hours.
According to RTL, sponsor of the singer's latest tour, Johnny Hallyday agreed, however, to be subjected to an induced coma to avoid "pain and complications".
Within less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we will be more sure about his condition, RTL adds.
The press service, questioned by AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to some sources" no cannula would have been introduced after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the Monceau International Clinic due to a disc hernia.
The intervention, scheduled for a few days, was practiced by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known physician in the artistic environment.
On Thursday night, Delajoux declined to comment on the information transmitted by RTL.
Singer Johnny Hollyday was admitted to the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday for an infection derived from Delajoux’s intervention.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, Johnny Hallyday's close friend, told RTL on Thursday that his friend was going through "a bad moment", but assured that there was "no problem" because the rocker is "a fighter".
He called me just before he traveled to Los Angeles, and I told him it was nonsense to fly twelve hours after such an operation, it wasn’t possible,” said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday night, Camus’s producer, Jean-Claude Camus, stated that Johnny Hallyday “reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics” and that the infection was “controlled”.
Camus said he had talked to Laeticia, the musician's wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer’s health problems multiplied since July when he was interned for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed that he had been operated for a “colon cancer” after a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed, as planned, his long "Gira 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been commented exaggerated. fanatics and journalists noticed the musician’s difficulties in moving on stage.
In mid-November, his neighbors even had to deny a new internment.
Euro 2009/short pool: Bousquet's first title in his favorite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, triple medalist at the 2009 World Cup in long swimming pool, won an international title on a distance he feels affectionate for, 50 m free, during Euro 2009 in a short swimming pool in Istanbul.
In the first day of this competition in which polyurethane bathers were allowed for the last time, only three world records were broken when many more were actually expected.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by the Russian in relief 4 x 50 m 4 styles (male).
A penalty for Bousquet, who coveted the world record in 50 m free, a mark he possesses in a long pool (20.94).
In one of the two queen distances of swimming, in 50 m free, the 28-year-old Frenchman imposed himself with 20'53 during a final where ten swimmers competed instead of eight as usual, an international first.
Bousquet went ahead of Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to drop the world mark (20.30), as he had planned.
We can always aspire to something better and, in that case, I already said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try to reach it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore polyurethane swimsuits that will be banned from 1st January.
These swimmers, originating 238 world records since February 2008, end their epic in Istanbul, where they competed for the first time in 1999 for the same test.
This time the use of the bathers did not help the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in long swimming this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer failed to drop his mark in 400 m free (3:32.77), however, he imposed himself with the second best time of his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn’t give up in this race.
I knew that this time I’t be able to beat a world record, but I managed to defend my title and fulfilled my mission.
Lobintsev will be a tough rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
US: A sarcophagus panel belonging to Zola sold for $1.5 million
A panel of a Roman sarcophagus belonging to French writer Emile Zola was sold on Thursday for $1.5 million, well above the estimated price, Sotheby's art marchant announced.
This panel, 2 meters long and 63 cm tall, dates from the 3rd century AD, and its price was estimated to be between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "representing four Dionysian scenes, in a sophisticated architectural framework, surrounded by satirists and drunk women, is an unusual piece, as there are only four or five in the world," Florent Heintz, vice president of art auctions of ancient Rome and Egypt at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold in hundreds of lots.
The sale continues, but so far this batch has been the most sought by buyers, without a doubt, a spokesman for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy, told AFP.
Only a few days ago, it was discovered that the marble was an acquisition of Emile Zola.
For almost 300 years, the panel formed part of the famous collection of the Borges family in Rome, then appeared successively in the house of French actress Cécile Sorel, as an element of her bathroom in her particular Paris mansion, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, minister of the Third French Republic and president of the Council for a short time, before Marshal Pétain took power.
For about fifty years, his destination was uncertain.
Reviewing the database of the Louvre Museum, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Honduras suspends Zelaya's departure from Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico estimated that the conditions were not given to transfer to its territory the ousted President of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, to whom the coup government denied salvage.
At the moment, after a phone conversation overnight with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of carrying out the transfer, Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa said.
The Mexican government plane that arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday to take Zelaya has returned to its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate-General for Migration.
To grant him a bailout, the coup government wanted to force Zelaya to "render" and ask for political asylum abroad.
But the ousted president refused because he wanted to come to Mexico as head of state in a guest exercise.
The coup government "suffered a new defeat by asking me to resign from my post (...), they wanted me to resign," Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, in which he has often made statements since the beginning of the five-month political crisis in the Central American country.
Here I can stay for ten years, I have my guitar, the Deputy President, who has been a refugee in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months, added by playing some acordes.
The Mexican embassy submitted to us a rescue request, but unfortunately we could not accept it because it did not contain an asylum request, Interior Minister Oscar Raúl Matute told Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
I will not ask for asylum from any country, Zelaya said in an interview with Telesur, whose headquarters is in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I will do so as president of the Honduran people.
Rumors about Zelaya's departure mobilized on Wednesday supporters of the deposed president, who gathered around the Brazilian embassy, heavily besieged by the military.
Brazil’s Foreign Minister, Celso Amorim, criticized the coup government’s position.
That reflects the marginal character of this government against international norms, he estimated.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuela’s socialist president, Hugo Chávez, was overthrown on June 28, the day he had organized a referendum to prepare his re-election, rejected by the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he returned surprisingly on September 21 and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be detained and will have to respond to justice for the crime of "high treason", according to the coup government.
The de facto president, Roberto Micheletti, managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace Zelaya.
This election was recognized by the United States, but questioned by Latin American countries, such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress massively voted against Zelaya's return to power until his term ended on January 27.
Wall Street rises, U.S. trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed up on Thursday, the figures of the U.S. trade balance are a faithful witness to the economic revival of both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67%; and the Nasdaq, 0.33%.
According to the final figures at the closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68, 78 points reaching 10,405,83 points, and the Nasdaq, of technological component, 7,13 points reaching 2,190,06 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index rose 0.8% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
We get good news from different sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this is anecdotal, he clarified, considering that the market was concentrated “in the half-full glass.”
Peter Cardillo, of Avalon Partners, said investors were mostly focused on U.S. trade balance figures, “which reflect an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade deficit fell in October by 7.6% compared to September, to $32.9 billion.
Analysts expected a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The big news is the growth of trade volumes, in particular goods exports, which reflect the growth of the main economies that trade with the United States, said Christopher Cornell, of the research firm Economy.com.
In contrast, last week, unemployment registrations in the United States rose unexpectedly, 474,000 applications were submitted.
But in the course of the last four weeks, the average number of new job seekers “was the lowest in a year,” said Scott Marcouiller, of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3.482% against 3.423% on Tuesday night, and that of the 30-year bond to 4.492% against 4.408% on the eve.
Cuba: More than a hundred Abushan supporters to the “White Ladies”
On Thursday, hundreds of supporters of the Cuban government stunned the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day and prevented another demonstration to which a dozen dissidents were called.
Around forty “Ladies of White,” wives or relatives of political prisoners, were assaulted on the street by supporters of the government of Raul Castro as they walked towards the center of the capital demanding the release of those detainees, an AFP reporter said.
The Yankees die!, “Mercenaries!”, “The street belongs to the revolutionaries!” and “Viva Fidel and Raul!” the militants of power chased the dissidents with their fist up.
These latter were escorted by agents dressed as civilians who came to “protect them.”
On the eve, a similar demonstration unleashed against the “White Ladies” in Havana, with no injured or arrested.
But in the Havanese neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to protest on Thursday on International Human Rights Day were arrested by police officers dressed as civilians, an AFP reporter said.
Officers forcibly climbed vehicles to the dissidents who were struck by government supporters, the journalist said.
In general, the arrest of dissidents in similar circumstances only lasts a few hours.
The "Ladies of White", awarded the 2005 Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament, had organized an unauthorized march to "solve the release of all political prisoners", about 200 according to the dissent, declared one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Hector Maceda, purges a 20-year prison sentence.
Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, of whom 53 are still behind bars.
The Cuban authorities label the opponents as “mercenaries” or “agents” at the salary of their declared enemy, the United States.
Rarely in the media, Cuban television on Thursday’s demonstration of government militants against the “counter-revolutionaries.”
Cuba, ruled by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of undermining rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
An outsider kills an octogenary with a knife and leaves 5 wounded in Clichy-la-Garenne
An imbalanced man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and wounded five others in the city center of Clichy-la-Garenne (Altos del Sena) on Thursday afternoon at the time of the greatest influx.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old aggressor would have struck with two knives and for reasons not yet determined, an elderly man, in the pharmacy or in front of it at No. 85 of the boulevard Jean-Jaurès, police sources and witnesses said.
As a result of the serious injuries, the man born in 1929 died in the hospital, according to a police union official Alliance.
Then in the pharmacy or in front of it, he attacked a pregnant woman who was with her partner.
The 30-year-old man was killed and wounded.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were taken to the hospital where the elderly man died.
The life of the other wounded, with the vital organs apparently affected, is in danger.
Then the pregnant woman suffered a fainting and was interned "in a state of shock," a police source said.
The armed man, who seemed to be under the effects of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would have escaped by the boulevard Jean Jaurès.
Apparently by chance, he would have injured two other pedestrians: a 30-year-old man, and another 40-year-old seriously.
At night, the scene of the crime was still unclear.
He was armed with two butcher knives crossed on his back, said Arnaud Pressé, a trade union leader in the Altos del Sena.
Several passers, including young people, attempted to control the alienated, according to AFP testimony.
I saw a guy about thirty years old wearing a green jacket.
Three men tried to intercept him.
They didn’t get it because the guy was strong, Alberto, a waitress at a nearby bar, explained.
A crowd was thrown over him, including a police officer who broke his doll, he added.
On the boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at the height of No. 61, two municipal agents, including the chief, tried to stop the armed man and were wounded, according to police testimonies.
The events occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where numerous shops are located.
Some people came to tell me there was a man injured on the street.
When I put him in a safe position, I noticed a very serious wound in the abdomen, said Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person, about 35 years old, arrived with knife wounds.
Police arrested the man without identity documents.
The Nanterre Prosecutor’s Office submitted the investigation to the jurisdiction of the Departmental Service of the Judicial Police of Altos del Sena (SDPJ 92).
The man was hospitalized on Thursday night.
During his detention he did not say a word.
A police source does not rule out the possibility of being interned in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, six policemen were needed to dominate him at the Clichy police station where he was transferred.
He was "in a state of over-excitation" as "any disorder of this type whose forces increase considerably under the effect of action."
U.S.: Polanski's lawyer calls for rejection of the case
The lawyer of the Franco-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has again called on Thursday in Los Angeles (Western California), that the case against his client, who is under house arrest in Switzerland, for a case of sexual abuse occurred more than 30 years ago, be dismissed.
Chad Hummel, a lawyer for the director of "The Pianist", denounced before three judges of the California Second District Appeal Chamber serious procedural errors at the time of the events, in 1977.
Hummel said: “I claim that at the same time the charges are rejected, as the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at that time, Laurence Rittenband, “resulted scary.”
According to him, judge Rittenband (died since) would have talked to a prosecutor who would have commented that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison, before dictating a sentence, which constitutes a serious lack of procedure.
This conversation was made public in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, sought and desired), from the own mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But eventually Wells declared at the end of September that he had "lied" to the author of the documentary.
Hummel claimed the holding of a trial that would allow him to present the evidence of his argument in case the court rejects the rejection of the case.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument put forward in the first instance, namely that no serious rejection of the charges could be assessed as long as Roman Polanski did not appear before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978 before his sentence for “illegal sexual relations” with a 13-year-old was ruled.
Since then, he has never again footed the United States.
Los Angeles District Deputy Fiscal Phyllis Asayama said Roman Polanski "must be here to appear in the audience."
With this cause, do we want to transmit the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that there is a possibility of fleeing?
For her, the filmmaker “wants a favor from the court, although he disregards his authority.”
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to pronounce their verdict, also stressed “that there were other alternatives to the decision to flee.”
Hummel was not the only one who asked to dismiss the case against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer’s lawyer, the victim, also demanded, once again, that the case be closed.
She argues that her client can no longer tolerate being harassed every time the Polanski case resurfaces, and adds: "Nobody in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland.
After more than two months after the raids, he was sentenced to house arrest in his cabin in Gstaad, awaiting an eventual extradition.
Wall Street loses course and slows down by dollar rise
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Friday without a turnaround, in a market that is debated between better indicators than those expected in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final figures at the closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.67 points reaching 10.471.50 points, while the technological component Nasdaq lost 0.55 points to stand at 2.190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index up 0.37% (4.06 points), reaching 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver, of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains with narrow margins, the volume of exchanges is increasingly reduced and I think it will remain so until the end of the year.
The trend continued thanks to the publication of better than expected economic indicators, which “helped to improve market opinion as to the solidity of economic revitalization,” Charles Schwab’s analysts summed up.
In the United States, retail sales increased 1.3% in November for the second consecutive month and greater than expected.
In addition, U.S. consumer confidence visibly recovered in December, 73.4 against 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indices were slowed by a new advance of the dollar that reached the highest level in the last two months against the euro, “leading down sectors sensitive to the economic situation,” said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
In this way, technological values have lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3,540% against 3.482% on Wednesday night, and that of the 30-year bond to 4.497% against 4.492% on the eve.
Miss World again in South Africa
After a month of touring South Africa, the 112 candidates for the title of Miss World are in the final straight to fulfill their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion spectators.
During this great beauty celebration organized for the second consecutive year around Johannesburg, five of them already achieved their participation in the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss Sportsman or, even, Miss Top Model during their stay in Africa.
It was a real revolt.
It was extraordinary to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
I have seen a lot of things and lived countless experiences! said Miss Sierra Leone.
This competition, which is held for the ninth time in South Africa, will be broadcast live on Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 17 h (15 h GMT).
I can’t imagine a better country to deliver my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am very happy to have lived twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the possibility of re-discovering "Africa's breathtaking landscapes".
After a month of gales, rehearsals, press rounds and safaris, Miss World candidates concentrate on the competition.
Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who won the election in 2000, and Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of whom became Bollywood stars.
Every woman’s dream is to be crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it’s not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown, Miss India declares with a big smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional dresses and, of course, with a bathing suit.
Chinese host Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean, and Miss World committee leader Steve Douglas will lead the event.
South Africa has proved to be able to welcome the world with warmth and pride hard to match, says Julia Morley, president of the Miss World competition.
Like last year, the candidates took a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bicycle, and tasted the local cuisine.
As an exceptional fact, they met South African President Jacob Zuma, who stretched their hand.
Something unusual for a head of state, observes Miss Sierra Leone.
His best memory will be the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the 2010 World Cup in June, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I was dealing with people I never thought I would meet.
She is likely to return for the 2010 World Cup, says enthusiastic Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
News about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive," according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive," his son David said on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles airport to accompany his father hospitalized several days ago.
The news is very positive.
Daddy is strong and everything is going very well, David Hallyday told the press when he descended from the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 13 a.m. local time.
The singer's son, distracted, said he would move "as soon as possible" to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday entered on Monday for an infection derived from a disc hernia operation on November 26 in Paris.
The musician is "in coma induced since that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and thus be able to administer his treatment," the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been subjected to a coma induced by doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where he entered on Monday for an infection, a sequel to a disc hernia operation on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was operated once again on the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to serious injuries produced by the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia went on Friday morning to the French high school in Los Angeles, where her daughter Jade attends, to witness a school event, an AFP photographer confirmed.
The head of orthopedic surgery and traumatology at the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel to Los Angeles on Monday to be with the singer.
The producer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer on November 26 at the international private clinic of Parc Monceau, in Paris.
They said it was a massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, Camus said.
He talks about a possible claim, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus argued that Johnny Hallyday had "travelled too fast to Los Angeles with the permission of the Paris surgeon."
I spoke directly to the doctor and he surprised me when he assured me there was no problem in making the trip, since I was operated twice for disc hernia, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he indicated that apparently the singer had "goed away without cannula, without anything," after his Paris operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
He operated actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where Delajoux worked at that time.
In 2007, he also intervened with actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematoma formed as a result of a cerebral bleeding.
He is a poorly reputed physician, convicted by the justice on several occasions for misconduct, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer for the Order of Physicians, accused him of being “a man without scruples” sued “regularly” before the Order Council, and is “far from recommendable.”
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He said the intervention "was carried out without any inconvenience" and that the results of the postoperative studies were "normal".
The operation "cannot cause bleeding and therefore did not require drainage," he added.
Anyway, the singer’s tour, whose health problems have multiplied since the summer, entered a parenthesis.
Without a doubt, resuming the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, NDLR) as planned, seems to me very risky, Camus declared.
The UDF Association raises the tone and warns the New Centre about the use of its acronym
The association UDF (Union for French Democracy), controlled by the MoDem (Democratic Movement) of François Bayrou, reacted on Friday to the attempt by the president of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, to launch an OPA (Public Procurement Offer) on the acronym of the former Giscardist party, intimidating him to withdraw it from all support, with the penalty of being sued.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF, considering that François Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political legacy after having stretched his hand to the left.
On the other hand, the Defense Minister, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
As support for its management, it received the help of Deputy Hervé de Charette (former UMP, current NC) who claimed ownership of the UDF brand, since he was the first to register it at the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday night, the office of the UDF association, controlled by François Bayrou’s friends who do not want to be deprived of the association, broke the silence to launch a request to the Minister and the deputy by urging them to renounce the label and transfer to them the rights of ownership of the brand, under penalty of judicial action.
In recent days, you have made many statements insinuating that you would propose to your political movement to recover the acronym UDF, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of the MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Centrist Alliance.
They also believe it is correct to continue using the name of the movement, the +Nouveau centre+, and the slogan +l'UDF d'aujourd'hui+ in their militant material and on the presentation page of their site, the signatories of the letter say.
As they already know, they have no right to use the acronym, the UDF office explains, which demands that the NC remove "immediately the mention of the UDF name from all media, as well as from (your) Internet site".
He also asked Hervé de Charette "to transfer the property of (the) brand to the legitimate right-owners."
If not, it will appeal to justice to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warn.
In the letter, they specify that the UDF "is a real political movement since 1978" and recall that Morin and his friends "choose" to go in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had already done in 2002 to create the UMP".
Therefore, the New Centre has, according to them, no right to use the acronym UDF.
They also recall that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 for its membership in the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office in charge of defending "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, “when he registered the brand,” he was no longer “member of the UDF for three years,” but of the UMP.
Scandalously and fraudulently take advantage of the lack of registration of the acronym UDF to do it on your own.
This indiscretion is becoming a crime, they denounce, before mocking the NC’s strategy: “We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make your own name than to try to get out of the anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which you have no right.”
Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier to be tried for abuse of weakness
On Friday, the Nanterre Court decided to bring the artist François-Marie Banier to trial to determine whether, as the daughter of multimillionaire Liliane Bettencourt says, he took advantage of the weakness of the octogenary to spoil her from a part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of stars of the show, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime whose sentence consists of a maximum sentence of three years in prison and 375,000 euros in fine.
This means that in this case there will be a process worthy of a saga about one of the wealthiest families in France, in which mother and daughter are disputing the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
But Correctional Court No. 15 also ordered 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt to undergo a medical examination by three medical professionals.
L'Oréal's heir and principal shareholder has always refused to undergo such examinations, even more in the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
Doctors appointed on Friday will have to submit a report before 10 March 2010 in which they will have to make a statement whether Liliane Bettencourt suffered from weaknesses and during what periods.
I think he will accept.
I’m going to talk to her,” Ms. Bettencourt’s lawyer, Georges Kiejman, said after leaving the hearing.
Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers’ lawyer, Olivier Metzner, was pleased with the court’s decision.
It’s an excellent news (...) The review will show that he (Banier) manipulated this elderly lady, whom we must protect, he said.
Two years ago, Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter filed criminal lawsuits against François-Marie Banier, a multifaceted photographer and artist, accusing him of having taken advantage of her mother’s weakness for years to obtain a billion euros in donations, through checks, life insurance contracts or works of art.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a longtime friend.
On Friday, while the court examined the origin of Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers’s lawsuit, the lawyers’ allegations resulted, at times, in a large family confession.
In this way, Liliane Bettencourt’s lawyer took into account three letters that her client had sent (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary in which she said she was suspicious of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers’ husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier between one and two times a day for fifteen years.
Since her wedding, I have never been able to talk to Françoise again."
For its part, the Nanterre Prosecutor’s Office considered, once again, that the plaintiff was not in a position to appear, much more so that a court of custody refused, in recent days, to make place to her request to open a judicial custody procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to appear before justice, is not under guardianship and has no guardian.
No other person will be able to appear in his place,” said Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney, a spokeswoman for the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
Finally, the court decided that the decision would be made once the judgment on the admissibility of Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers was conducted.
Management revolution or the end of business intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of the large French companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain.
More than a decade ago, the attitude of the management of large companies with respect to their employees recalls the position of companies with regard to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about employees adhering to “values” determined from above as before it was about imposing on consumers products thought by factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution gave its place to market conquest strategies... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that are not related to customer preference factors is repeated regularly.
Demobilization of employees can end in deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that affects executives.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially R&D and, even more, business intelligence.
Indeed, business intelligence “requires that all parties involved (...) have proactive behavior and a forward-looking vision”; it requires employee commitment that is completely opposed to the recommendations of an authoritarian leadership.
For this reason, we call for a managerial revolution, which would consist of putting employees at the center of the company’s concerns as well as the customer.
Internal opinion polls have a relative utility
Will internal opinion polls, such as Orange’s survey of its employees, encourage managerial revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I fear not.
-In principle, because I could verify that, in the face of a new situation, and after many rounds, all companies end up doing essentially... what they always did!
Secondly, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
Lastly, because most managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
As they come from the great schools of engineers, they interpret psychology mechanistically.
They adopt, for intellectual convenience, the ancient behavioral theory that American “neurosciences” have recently reactivated, and that the Institutes of Studies and the media have widely spread behind them.
In this way, by suggesting that it is possible to handle the “command” (sic) of executives’ commitment, a recent Ipsos research published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms executives in a mechanistic management posture, unadapted to today’s world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the good functioning of modern companies, implies adopting a finalist view of human behavior.
It consists in integrating in every reasoning or practice of business management, a fundamental fact: for employees, engagement with the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to realize part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only studies from Motifunctional Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivation.
Studies have shown that they judge their company based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through the image they have of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to their own life projects.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of mobilizing factors, business executives can control, predict and anticipate their “social performance” and relocate human resource management “on the spot”.
In this way, they create a favorable ground for the organized development of a strong and effective business intelligence.
Oslo speech: for "just war" Obama receives praise from the right
On Friday, the American right, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States, hailed the Obama speech on Thursday.
Conservatives, who had discredited the award to Obama on October 9, this time applauded the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, a former vice president candidate during the 2008 election.
I loved what she said, Ms. Palin, a leading figure of the Republican party’s right wing, told USA Today, adding that she herself had addressed the issue of war “sometimes necessary” in her recently published memoirs.
In my opinion, war is, of course, the last thing the Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
Terrorists must be stopped, he said.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, dedicated himself, on Thursday in Oslo, to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 more soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another Obama opponent, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really very good, the former House president rejoiced, who appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words.
For moments, the speech seemed to me very historic, Gingrich said during an interview on the radio program "The Takeaway".
The former elected representative, whom some consider a possible candidate for the Republican investidura for the 2012 presidential election, was pleased to hear "a leftist president" remind the members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free or could deliver a peace prize if the recourse to force did not exist."
According to Michael Gerson, author of George W. Bush’s speeches and current chronicler for the Washington Post, Obama delivered “a very American speech.”
In addition to presenting himself as a “world citizen,” as “always does,” he “speaks like a U.S. president” by reminding Europeans “that they live in a security bubble that they have not created and that they do not do much to preserve it,” Gerson said.
Among the few right-wing not very convinced, a Bush-era falcon, former U.N. ambassador John Bolton, described the speech as “monotonous, pretentious and lacking inspiration” on the Internet site National Review Online.
On the left of the president, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we cover war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocent people, he warned.
However, the center-left press praised the president.
The Los Angeles Times, although still believing Obama received the Nobel Prize prematurely, called his speech "superproduction" especially for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech "should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression," the newspaper commented enthusiastically.
Obama "pronounced the speech that was necessary," the New York Times estimated, judging it "at the same time shady and edifying."
Road transport: three marathon negotiations to ensure Christmas supply
After three sessions of marathon negotiations, road trade unions and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only patronal organization that remained until the end, reached an agreement on Friday afternoon that puts an end to the strike slogan and the threat that falls on the Christmas supply.
During the signing session on Friday night, state transport secretary Dominique Bussereau "rejoiced" over the deal, following several negotiations that began Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators said goodbye at Friday’s dawn in the hope of quickly signing the agreed text at the end of the morning.
Three employers’ organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTHER) withdrew.
But a meeting of more than six hours that began at 11 o’clock was necessary for everyone to agree and the text to be signed at 18 o’clock.
The conflict “would have been very damaging to” and “it was feared to disrupt the end-of-year holidays,” Bussereau said.
The text foresees an increase of 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and of 2.9% for the highest wages (international transport).
The hourly fee will rise from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros for low wages.
It’s not much, but we started with a lot of disadvantage, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
If so, we will order our militants that there are no more cuts or blockades in the supply centers.
But there can always be some disconforming rebel, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, acknowledged that it was "a good deal", although it was "difficult to grant increases to high wages given international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros monthly for the low wages and from 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It’s a common sense agreement that respects the wages, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as “an historic agreement.”
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) it is “an acceptable commitment.”
The agreement also envisages an increase in travel expenses of 3% and the holding of general assemblies of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will allow, above all, to address the issue of an extraordinary payment and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a 100 million euro reduction in employer charges" was the subject of a government amendment to the rectification funding bill for 2009, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote on it "under the same terms".
The signature of TLF allows the agreement to be applied, first, to the companies joining this organization and, secondly, to the entire profession, in case the Minister of Labour makes an extension.
It will be done “as soon as possible,” Bussereau said.
Opposition from employers could only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced that it was a "naive business", as the 100 million euros "were already promised to the sector to compensate for part of the CO2 tax".
The Secretary of State for Transportation forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but not to frustrate those who want to eat turkey at the upcoming Christmas dinner, the Unostra lamented.
The agreement puts at risk “the stability of very small and medium-sized enterprises in the sector over the next 12 months.”
RER A: Conflicts during the weekend, unions disconform with the proposals of the RATP
Conflicts on RER A, France’s largest urban public transportation line, will continue during the weekend, because at Friday’s meeting, the second day of strike between unions and the RATP leadership, there was no agreement and unions were dissatisfied with their request for a premium.
For this important weekend of Christmas shopping, on Saturday and Sunday only trains will circulate between 10 a.m. and 20 a.m., at a rate of one train per two in the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one train per four on the other lines.
Interconnection with the SNFC will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, forcing passengers to change trains.
The Lafayette Galleries, which expect 200,000 customers every day, rejoiced that “the RATP is striving to provide service to large stores.”
The RER crosses the city of Paris from west to east.
The RATP route runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, approximately one in two trains circulated in peak hours, and almost no train in valley hours, as planned.
On Thursday there was no disorder on the slopes thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the Island of France.
In this way, at dawn, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than usual, especially due to the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had gotten up “an hour and a half earlier to get to schedule.”
The Saint-Lazare station was not saturated, the SNCF said, which had planned the surveillance of police and law enforcement.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from the Saint-Lazare station to join the meters.
New general assemblies of striking workers will take place on Saturday and Sunday, analyzing the results, "not satisfactory" according to the unions, of a meeting that was held with the management on Friday afternoon.
The director of the RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects for the RER A: working time, professional development, etc.
This is not what drivers want to claim a premium they owe, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts between parentheses its premium proposals, the CGT commented indignantly, noting that the management "was not able to solve a problem that the SNCF and the road sector had already solved".
A new meeting is planned on Monday to carry out “a more extensive analysis of the conditions for the exercise of the profession,” the RATP said.
What also led the unions to say that the company “did not care about weekend users.”
In the morning, about 150 drivers stormed a committee at the headquarters in Paris.
Then the leadership, which until then refused to dialogue during the strike, suggested the meeting “to calm the waters.”
The conflict could spread to RER B on Tuesday, after the Unsa and the Independents have submitted a preliminary notice.
The unions demand a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Indépendants) and complain of the degradation of working conditions on this line that has a million daily passengers.
RER drivers, all in the second degree of their professional career, charge from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and from 600 to 650 euros of premiums, for hours with alternating turns, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish court dissolves prokurd party, decision with serious consequences
Turkey's Constitutional Court failed on Friday to dissolve the country's main prokurd party, a decision that immediately provoked rage demonstrations in the Kurdish community, in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which has just handed out a hand to the Kurdish community trying to end 25 years of conflict.
The party of the Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become the "focus of activities that damaged the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," the court president Hasim Kiliç told the press after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although only a majority of seven votes was needed to obtain the dissolution, Kiliç said, adding that 37 of the party’s leaders, including its president Ahmet Türk and deputy Aysel Tugluk, are excluded from political life for five years.
Also, the judge announced the cessation of parliamentary immunity of which Turk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of party assets by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 banks in the Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders warned before the verdict that deputies would leave Parliament before being parliamentarians without a party label.
The decision comes following a procedure launched by the Supreme Court prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya in 2007 that accuses the DTP of obeying the “principles” of the Kurdish Workers’ Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many other countries.
Numerous observers believe that the DTP is the legal political escape of the PKK rebels.
However, the party says it has no "organic ties" with the PKK, but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court’s verdict comes as the government gives a hand to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen their rights so that the Kurds stop supporting the PKK and thus put an end to the conflict.
DTP leaders said a dissolution could lead to a rise in tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where a large number of protests against the conditions of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan’s detention have degenerated into clashes with police over the past few weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of protesters have gathered in front of the DTP locations in Diyarbakir, the large county in the southeast mostly populated by Kurds.
The Order Forces threw tear grenades and used water cannons, while protesters threw Molotov bombs or stones.
In Istanbul, about 100 people were also gathered.
Following the verdict, Türk said the court’s decision would “deep the discouragement.”
Turkey cannot solve this issue (Kurdistan, NDLR) by dissolving a party, he told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
We are opposed to the closure of parties.
This is not the case, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
This decision completely boycotts the democratic openness launched by the government, said political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack in which seven soldiers were killed three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the bloodiest attacks in recent months.
The snow may start suddenly.
A truly cool winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
In no way is something with which you want to make life impossible to citizens, comments the director of road maintenance in the winter of the FES
But with this, your employees can learn to test and master the whole of vehicle technology.
This week, meteorologists announced it for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of the snow and ice.
In this case, the ESF acts in accordance with a thorough plan.
As soon as it snow abundantly in Frankfurt and temperatures fall below zero degrees, 20 of the so-called A tracks with large vehicles with salt leave, explains Brauburger.
These include, for example, the main arteries and avenues such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also access to the fire department, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and slopes, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service begins around three in the morning
They should be covered approximately 1,040 kilometers, as needed, in a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which adheses better.
This is why the FES begins around three o’clock in the morning, “with that the roads are free until the traffic starts at the point hours.”
It starts to snow around 7:30 a.m.
“Then we have a problem,” commented the road maintenance director in the winter, “because then nobody is ready to loosen room for salt vehicles.”
Immediately afterwards, when it is no longer snowing, it touches the secondary and private roads, to which also belongs the Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is given to the side and secondary streets.
This is where the discomfort is generated, Brauburger knows well.
Around five o’clock in the morning, the FES infantry is launched, mainly the dangerous points and cruisers are cleared.
Generally, the FES could not take care of all bicycle lanes.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 22 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. does not lose sight of mostly the bridges, says Brauburger.
As these become slick quickly, the salt vehicle starts as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
In case of emergency, the police can also call them.
The Dinosaur's Cradle
The Tawa hallae had the same appearance as many other carnivorous dinosaurs: a two-foot-long and 1.50-foot-high animal running on the two strong rear legs, had an elongated head with sharp and curved teeth, short arms with fox-shaped tails and a long tail.
If the species had lived a couple of millions of years later, this would not have been something special.
But the Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in Thursday's Science magazine.
The species lived around 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which at that time was in a dry area of the supercontinent Pangea in the equator.
Tawa opened a new window into the early evolution of dinosaurs, Nesbitt says.
It shows us a lot about the genealogy, spread and characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists began in 2006 an excavation at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes, we have found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, this is something unprecedented for Trias sediments, reports Randall Irmis, a team member at the Utah Natural History Museum.
The researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
During the excavation, the remains of five specimens were collected.
Discovery confirms theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an exceptional finding: "Triassic dinosaur fossils are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not share such enthusiasm at all.
This finding is not spectacular, but confirms some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, says for example Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
But many of the older fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these early dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Thus, experts debate, for example, when the Sauridae were divided into their three most important genealogy: the carnivorous teropods among which are the Tyrannosaurus Rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the quadruped sauropods known as "long neck" and their relatives, and the Ornithischia herbivorous (saurs with bird pelvis), to which belong, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
According to Nesbitt and colleagues' analysis, Tawa hallae is a primitive teropod.
This shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
For example, in the skull of Tawa hallae researchers found clues to air bags, such as those also possessed by the descendants of the teropods, birds.
Thanks to air bags, birds are more efficient in breathing than mammals.
In the case of Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were evidently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive airbag teropod, says Randall Irmis.
Because the related line of the later giant sauropods also possessed air bags and light bones, it was likely that the common ancestors of both groups had already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs so far known lived in South America, the researchers deduce that the saurs originated there for the first time.
Consequently, the three genealogy lineages separated at the outset and spread from South America to all corners of the Earth, which at that time still formed a single land mass, the supercontinent Pangea.
However, the facts say the team found along with Tawa hallae the remains of two other not very intimately related teropods.
The three cannot descend from a single related predecessor, the researchers argue.
We believe there have been at least three waves of migration toward North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the study Science.
Of course, there are opponents too.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a brother group of dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
Their opinion could give a distorted picture, because simply in South America many dinosaur fossils are still preserved, while on other continents there is barely anything to discover.
The question of how dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare reptile collateral line to Mesozoic dominant terrestrial vertebrates remains an enigma.
In the Trias, dinosaurs still shared their living space with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of current crocodiles and pterosaurs and with many other sauri.
Towards the end of the Trias dinosaurs expanded all over the world and many new species developed, while the parenthood extinguished at the limit of the Trias to the Jurassic.
Success stories are not eternal.
There are two possibilities to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass extinction to which dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they were able to defeat the adversaries in the area.
Success stories are not always eternal.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact stopped the rise of a group of species, which had also already evolved in the Trias and since then had a miserable existence: mammals.
From Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors from the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley, California participate.
Teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen participate.
The police evacuation of the occupied casino at the Goethe University in Frankfurt impacted the world.
278 professors and lecturers from Goethe University, although also from higher education centres across Germany, Europe and North and South America, show solidarity with students in protest at the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they “reject” the police displacement promoted by the board of directors.
Werner Müller-Estler, president of the university, last week evacuated the building occupied by students and teachers in educational strike because the walls and works of art were covered with propaganda.
As a result, five students suffered injuries.
The material damage, the signatories judge, does not justify "the violent dissolution of the courses organized by the same students and teachers by a police command".
The displacement represented an “unacceptable attack” on freedom of research and learning.
The exclusive focus on vandalism served to “delegitimate and criminalize protest” and diverted attention from content.
The board of directors refused to engage in the necessary negotiations.
The teachers demand the immediate withdrawal of the judicial complaint.
Most of the occupants have not caused any material damage, it is said.
Legitimated protest
Young people from the Verdi trade union and the German Federation of Trade Unions also show solidarity with the students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of a growing concern for Verdi’s own future, commented Verdi’s national youth secretary, Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), Minister of Science of Hessen defended, however, the performance of the university rector and the police.
We are grateful to the Rector of the University.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, he commented on an Aktuelle Stunde broadcast on Thursday in the Wiesbaden province parliament.
We are understanding the protest, but we are not understanding vandalism, said Peter Beuth, a CDU delegate to the provincial parliament.
The opinions of the opposition factions, the SPD, the Greens and the left, are different.
The CDU used painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, Janine Wissler (left) said.
Instead of thoroughly studying the students’ arguments and demands, they are displaced.
The Left has submitted a motion, in which the Minister of the Interior is requested to present a report on the police intervention.
The Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten Moscow districts, was in the Soviet Union a heavily guarded site for secret weapons research.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Here are important research and production centers of micro and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd have contacted the Riedberg scientific headquarters in Frankfurt, with university institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
Several mutual visits were made and now, on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg sign in Frankfurt a "Protocol of close collaboration".
Moscow deputy mayor Juri Rosljak and mayor of Selengrad, Anatoly Smirnov, headed the Russian delegation; by Frankfurt signed chief of planning services Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010 representatives of the FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises of the research center for natural sciences will travel to a seminar in Selenograd.
Scientific exchanges
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it also deals with commercial relations.
FIZ companies will have the opportunity to set foot in the growing Russian market.
In exchange, Russian research companies want access to contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of important Russian companies and research institutes.
Among them are, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large consortiums Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "Socialist Planning City" for arms research.
Selenograd (literally translated as "Green City") received its name from the landscape of forested mountains, in which research facilities were established.
Brakes in Stuttgart
The Stuttgart Dimension 21 is not placed for anything high enough.
For the supporters of the project it is simply and smoothly “the new heart of Europe”.
S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which will precipitate to the capital of the Banden-Württemberg region a decade of chaos of irreparable construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 emerged from the spirit of the 1980s.
Railway terminals, which end in the middle of the city, were then considered to be 19th-century engineering fossils, which acted as brakes for modern railway traffic, since it used to take an enormous amount of time to plug the locomotives backwards.
Roll, stop in dry, continue the journey; but so it must be done.
And that’s why the terminals had to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a passing station, which is located approximately halfway from the route of the trans-European operating lines between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; hence the slogan of "Heart of Europe".
The S21 will really be started, even though the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost impagable to implement the reduction.
Railway terminals, of course, do not have any more entrance and exit problems, since there are reversible locomotives with tractor unit and driver car at both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE-built route to Ulm will already be started.
Federal and local governments have decided so.
The railway continues, also because the risks of the Republic’s large individual infrastructure projects are borne by the taxpayer and not the state.
From the urban point of view, the project is still justified to some extent.
A new urban space is created, provided with many green areas, probably from the computer-generated graphics of the designer.
For the rail transport system, the S21 is harmful.
The passing station and road support are intended for people transportation, which was attributed to the huge growth typical of the 1980s.
At that time, there was no competition for low-cost flights.
But modern transportation policy must first deal with strengthening freight transportation, as rail transportation is considerably more environmentally friendly than that carried out by trucks on the roads.
However, the new tracks under construction are good for cargo trains due to the intense gradients.
Even worse is that the S21 also indirectly affects many other railway projects.
More than 6 billion euros must be buried in the Zuavos.
That is the official figure.
Experts consider it more realistic between ten and fifteen billion.
It is certain that in the next decade money will be missing in other crossings and narrow passages in the network.
A total of 60 major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of more than 180 kilometers of long rails through the Rhin valley.
Since 1987 the trail has been built slowly.
It would be urgent here to step the accelerator properly.
However, the S21 acts as a brake.
The Rhine Valley section will be the bottleneck for international freight transportation: through the heart of Europe.
The government is reviewing the judgment on the airport.
The federal government leaves pending in the autonomous parliament of Wiesbaden, if it will appeal against the decision on the night flight ban of the administrative court of Hesse.
The CDU/FDP coalition appears to have commissioned experts to conduct a legal investigation into the VGH’s more than 400-page ruling, Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP) said.
The administrative court in Kassel had reasoned in writing on this date that in the case of the construction of the planned northwest landing piste at Frankfurt airport, the federal state would have to regulate again the ban on night flights.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 a.m. and 5 p.m., as envisaged by the federal government, would not be compatible with the mandatory legal protection of the population from noise due to air traffic.
The coalition has until January 4 to decide whether to appeal against this sentence.
The opposition criticized this delay and pressured government representatives to waive the appeal appeal before the nation’s Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The leader of the SPD group, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to respect their promises of prohibition of night air traffic, which they had made before the elections.
It’s pretty hard, if one lets them keep their word, said the leader of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP slogan “We keep our word.”
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel's accusation that the federal government would be trying to obtain their night flights by means of wrongdoing and tricks.
A thorough legal investigation would take a lot of time.
The coalition would not want to act on the basis of a “fast first impression.”
We need a legally untouchable decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As represented by the opposition, it would never have been their group’s claims about the ban on night air traffic.
U.S. banks are returning the loan.
The big U.S. banks shaken by the crisis are being stripped of their state bonds.
The "Bank of America" returned once the aid that had been provided by the Tarp bank rescue fund of a total of 45 billion (approximately 30 billion euros).
And also the Citi group plans to return state aid, according to a report from the U.S. CNBC.
With this, the institutes intend to free themselves from restrictions that had gone hand in hand with the acceptance of money, such as the limitation in the payment of bonuses to directors, as well as the payment of high fees.
The "Bank of America" had earned approximately 19 billion net money through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum was taken from the box itself, which had plenty of means, among others for the sale of rubles.
Banking chief Kenneth Lewis thanked U.S. taxpayers on Wednesday night: the financial injection helped overcome very difficult times.
The banking house had miscalculated the investment bank absorption effort at the climax of the financial crisis.
The Citi group also wants to get money in the capital market to be able to free themselves from their obligations to the state.
CNBC a source in well-known circles that the U.S. bank could already announce for Thursday the increase of its capital by $20 billion.
A representative of the Citi group did not want to comment.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already returned their subsidies.
The Fast Election
Eventually everything went faster than thought.
Just two weeks after the management board of the ZDF (German television channel) pressured editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender to resign, the channel can nominate a successor.
Last night, the parliament decided to vote on the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, director of the ZDF’s main studio in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this from the broadcaster, officially not to anticipate the procedure.
But it also influenced not harming ZDF director Markus Schächter anymore, if this proposal would not be approved in the board of directors.
Frey, Schächter’s candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the gremio.
The outcome of the vote was not yet defined at the closing of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter failed in the board of directors with his proposal to renew Nikolaus Brender’s contract for another five years.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him.Brender's dismissal was a bitter failure for Schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
Why the majority of the Union in the board already weeks before the election had indicated, that they would not support Brender in his position.
Opposition against the editor-in-chief had been organized by the president of the Hesse government, Mr. Roland Koch.
He declined another prestigious editor-in-chief mandate with the argument, that under Brender’s direction the ZDF news would have lost audiences.
Until shortly before the elections there were protests because of this, in which it flagelled political influence on the ZDF.
At the end of the day, 35 public law experts had entered into the debate, who called Koch’s proceedings unconstitutional.
But it served nothing.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied Politics, Pedagogy and Romanesque Philology.
He worked for the Southwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper.
In 1983 he changed to the ZDF, in principle to the informative "heute-journal".
Following stations: 1988 to 1990 personal rapporteur of the chief editorial; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and conductor of the morning program "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 director of the foreign policy of the ZDF; since then director of the ZDF studio in the capital.
The political party of the Greens announced a constitutional lawsuit following Brender's dismissal, who was elected as journalist of the year on Wednesday by media magazine "Medium Magazin".
Koch’s opposite in the board, the president of the Rhineland-Palatinate government, explained last week that the federated states should change the ZDF state convention in such a way that the director’s staff proposals cannot be blocked by a political-motivated majority.
A retirement of politicians supportive of the ZDF control gremies was dismissed by Beck.
Brender’s likely successor, Mr. Peter Frey, recommended himself to the board with a clever play: he strongly criticized the gremio for Brender’s dismissal.
Thanks to this test of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to nominate him for the post of editor-in-chief without losing his face, as the board of directors was able to vote for him, without falling under the suspicion of giving him the post to a party sequel.
In the calculations of the parties Frey is allocated to the left-wing liberals.
University courses are broken
Partial success for students: After a year of education-related strikes, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the federal states finally ceded.In a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university rectors, both sides agreed to try to improve study conditions in the cases of bachelor and master.
Students in the future should be able to outperform their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the test burden: basically each course module should end with only one exam.
In addition, it is intended to examine the workload of students, and it is intended to guarantee a "real and justifiable measure".
The policy and universities also want to simplify the recognition of exam results between universities within and outside Germany.
The federated states undertake to confection more flexibly the structural rules together for Bachelor and Master careers.
Regulations of the federal states that differ from this should no longer exist.
Less exams
Since the start of student protests in June, Ministers of Education and Culture and university directors have been continuously talking about improving the ability to successfully complete a career (studyability).
Now, for the first time, we talked about a specific content.
The so-called accreditation council agreed to drastically reduce the number of exams: "Each module ends with just one exam," it is said in a 30-page document, which aims to partially regulate the approval of university careers.
With the "sensitive reduction of the test burden" it is intended to avoid the development in the wrong direction, which would significantly affect the studying ability, so explained the director of the accreditation board, Mr. Reinhold Grimm.
Furthermore, in the future, “studyability” should be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
The modules and contents should be examined thoroughly as regards unnecessary restrictions of the students in the choice of courses.
The courses .
Students would have “the right to obtain more spaces, which enable and encourage their own initiative.”
These rules would apply to new races, but also to the examination of existing races.
These should be "re-accredited" again every five years. but this would mean, that it would take until the year 2015 to examine all races.
Responsible for this would be 10 accreditation agencies across the country, which are under the supervision of the accreditation council, which is installed by the federal states.
Education and culture ministers urged federal states in October to influence agencies in such a way that the amount of subjects and exams are not too strict or demanding.
In some federal states, universities and technical schools have already agreed with ministries to adopt such measures.
Until now, only Renania-Platinada has ensured additional means for the subsequent development of the Bologna process.
With this money the universities should implement programmes of student tutoring and counseling, as well as strengthen examination offices and abroad.
The federal government and the universities intend to dispose of 10 million euros for these purposes.
At the beginning of 2010 the government wants to bring to parliament a novel of the university law.
According to her, a single exam should be enough to complete a career model.
The configuration of the career should be made more flexible, as well as to ensure the recognition of evaluations in other universities and facilitate accessibility to the Master.
By the end of the coming year, it is intended to examine all careers about their “studyability.”
On Thursday, the government and the opposition discussed again on the conditions of studying in the federal state.
Apart from the praise, there were also criticisms about the decisions.
In the federal board of directors of the Juso (Young Socialists) university groups, it was demanded that the configuration of educational policy should no longer be carried out “through closed doors” by university ministers and rectors.
At the latest after the education strikes, now students as major stakeholders should be able to comment too.
University Rectors’ Board Chair Margret Wintermantel gave her support to the students: “We need the students’ experience,” she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with whom the HRK deliberated on a joint reform document.
For the trade union of education and science (GEW) the agreements of Bonn were not entirely sufficient: the trade union demands a legal right for every student with the Bachelor's degree to access a subsequent Master's career.
In addition, the federal states have to ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor students there are in the future enough study places for Master with the best possible study conditions.
The federal states have to hire a lot more teachers.
But about a greater access to the master, the Ministers of Education did not comment.
More than a footnote about Herta Müller
"Entry and exit from Germany is practically uncontrolled" says the first line of a poem by lyric Werner Söllner in imbalancing idiomatic fragments, in which it thematizes the experiences of arrival to Germany lived by a dissident, who won his freedom, but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked first as a German and English teacher in Bucharest, and later as a reader in a children’s book publisher, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner was awarded several literature awards, in 1993 he gave memorable lessons or poetry talks in Frankfurt at the Goethe University, and since 2002 he is director of the literature forum in Hesse at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He had to talk a lot last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "German Literature in Romania in the mirror and the disfigured mirror of its Securitate records"
Visibly insecure and ashamed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted involvement as IM in the Romanian secret service Securitate in front of fellow German-Romanian writers, among others Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of the present in 1989, Söllner had received the German Language Award.
Recruitment attempts had begun slowly, in early 1971.
“So I’m someone who didn’t defend himself enough against the attempts to provoke fear from the Securitate,” Söllner concluded.
Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Herta Müller and her unparalleled literary controversy with the mechanisms of dictatorial domination, the literary scene and especially the community of German authors from Romania is shaken by a case that evidences the abyss and evil of a political system, which is based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, so far as we know, not only an author, but also a victim.
In his Securitate IM expedition Walter had played a role, literary scientist Michael Markel said after Söllner's confession, and highlighted the positive influence for him of IM Walter.
He had excused him or defended him on all the difficult points for him, Markel said.
“I feel the moral need to make this statement,” he said.
Söllner’s statement in this way and in front of this audience was unexpected, the confession of a former dissident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, is not so surprising.
Germany would have been a comfortable haven for spies from the Securitate-Spitzel gewesen, Herta Müller wrote in July in the weekly Zeit, after reading her own 914-page expedition.
Those involved will have speculated, and will have known in some cases, what names were hidden behind the pseudonyms of Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike the review of the Stasi files with a controlled procedure in Germany, the handling of the control records by the Securitate is still quite diffuse.
A systematic clarification has been boycotted and hindered in recent years.
A national council for the clarification of the Securitate expedients (CNSAS), corresponding to the Birthler authority, was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the expedients since then has been given rather to traces.
Since 2005, there has been a law governing the administration of the records.
An interview, following the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Herta Müller, proves that the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still quite large.
“She has psychosis,” she was asked only once.
The infamy of power seemed to be shown without turns in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, inevitable questions arise with the Söllner case, like so many times when there is silent guilt.
The calm reaction of the listeners to Söllner’s confession leaves us expecting that the continuation of this story will be governed more by the cravings of knowledge and not so much by guilt and shame.
For the genesis of Herta Müller’s work, who yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize in Literature, it is more than a simple footnote.
The Champions League as a guarnition to fill the stomach
When Stuttgart's new VfB football team coach Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from his team's supplier, approached a Mercedes C-Class taxi a quarter-hour after midnight, it gave the impression that an elegantly dressed outdoor service member was coming out of a very pleasant Christmas celebration, in which the sportswear manufacturer had distributed samples.
The man of the characteristic calva had hired a driver, because he still did not know the city.
For the rest, he could also have driven the car himself: after all, there was no alcohol at stake, and the 55-year-old man was not drunk of joy either.
It had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work would start again.
Or I would start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days earlier: "It is true that we reached the final eighth," namely, in the Champions League, thanks to the 3:1 victory against Unirea Urziceni, of Romania, "but we cannot let ourselves be blinded by the success: we will have to fight brutally against the descent."
The “more important task” awaited them next Sunday, he said.
Then, it will be necessary to repeat in Maguncia the success of the “real classes” in the daily life of the league.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have been clearly evidenced again, after the fast three goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Sorteo
The Champions League final eighth matches (going matches on 16/17 and 23/24 of February/back matches on 9/10 and 16/17 of March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
So the joy was limited by the fulminant entrance of Babbel’s successor.
Not only in the supposed savior, which in a short time had inspired the confused professionals of Stuttgart confidence in themselves, willingness to surrender and taste for the game.
I went with the players and told them that they had to focus on their strengths, I urged them to be more thrown, explained the soul repairman Gross his recipe for success that so simple sounds, but that with the therapist Babbel had no effect.
He unleashed some magic, Babbel supporter Jens Lehmann accepted, “when in football a new momentum arises, sometimes things happen that would not have been thought possible.”
And Sami Khedira, who after a pause of several weeks due to an injury quickly advanced to become the best local player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the “phenomenon” perceived with the proverbial “fresh wind” and the way the new boss works: “He is a man who intervenes thoroughly, and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation.”
And this is what was missing, obviously, when Babbel was there.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the test, warns sports manager Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs above all constancy.
Like Gross, both the players and the manager refrained from overestimating the victory against a weakened defense due to lack of reliefs and totally overtaken by the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with the 0:4 had arrived the sad awakening, Khedira thought.
And manager Horst Heldt warned that while one goal of the season had been reached, the other was still very far away.
We have not overcome the problem yet.
That Heldt didn’t want to celebrate on his 40th birthday, even after the first victory at his headquarters three months ago, was due to the events of the weekend, which re-updated in the form of a television interview, broadcast just before the start of the game, that had been granted by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that others make, and not Jens, Heldt faced Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He had reproached weakness in the leadership to the board, which had decided to change coach by the pressure of teen fanatics.
Also that his free day had been eliminated after the games Lehmann called it a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann’s statements were “marked by pure selfishness,” Heldt replied, and announced consequences for the backpacker.
They are probably no longer friends forever, the two quarantines.
But at least they agreed with all the others that, without the prior efforts with the team of the replaced coach, the show of great play and battle force would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had “an important contribution to the success,” Heldt and Lehmann said unanimously; and the plastic suitcase man also agreed.
World Heavyweight Championships
Burning duel in Bern: Again and again the challenger Kevin Johnsonn was provoking world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve tough rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title in the WBC version.
The judges’ decision was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains world heavyweight champion.
The 38-year-old winner in the WBC association version defeated American Kevin Johnson on Friday night in Bern by unanimous decision by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was his third successful title defense since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already twice world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to the noqueus that everyone had expected.
Klitschko broadened his balance to 39 triumphs in 41 professional fights, twice he had to be defeated due to his injuries.
The challenger Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his 24th battle.
In front of some 17,000 spectators in the Berne Arena, Klitschko, with a height of 2,02 meters, wanted to dictate the fight especially with his left hand.
But Johnson, eleven centimeters lower, who before the duel had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era, was evading the world champion’s strikes over and over again, so Klitschko could not decisively bring his dangerous right to his goal.
In general, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger, and only tried to pass the rounds.
Although he was provoking Klitschko with words and gestures, his beats only rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in the year 2000, who held twelve complete rounds with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the reporter had already produced a certain scandal in the Swiss capital.
He had insulted Klitschko as a “horrible zombie,” who “does not know how to do anything.”
During the weighing, the champion let himself be provoked Friday to remove Johnson’s sunglasses from his nose “to be able to see his eyes.”
Fourth victory after Klitschko's return
Also in his fourth fight after his return on October 11, 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a break of almost four years, he then defeated Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had recovered "his" WBC belt, which he had previously had to deliver without fighting.
That year he later defeated Juan Carlos Gómez, of Cuba, and in September Chris Arreola, of the United States.
In this fight I only got a hit, and I am in very good physical condition, Klitschko explained his quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to gather all four major titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is a world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to the British David Haye, after he destroyed in November Nikolai Valujev, 2.13 meters tall.
In the previous summer, Haye had cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
Supposedly, the company that promotes him is already planning the fight against Klitschko at Wembley Stadium, London.
The case of Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: The leader of the group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, called Defense Minister Gutenberg a liar because of false information on the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and leftists demand an explanation from the chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin – Following the latest revelations about the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition has accused Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU) of knowingly deceiving.
In Saturday's news show "Tagesschau", broadcast by the ARD television channel, the leader of the Greens group, Jürgen Trittin, said the minister had "consciously not told the truth" about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, it is usually said: he lied.
The order to kill would have been given without taking into account the rules of the International Protection Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report that NATO had, and that Mr. Gutenberg has read, Trittin said.
On Friday it was that the attack was not only about destroying the kidnapped trucks, but also about intentionally killing two Taliban leaders.
In the U.S. airstrike, requested by the German commandant of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured.
The Greens, the SPD and the left urged on Saturday Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to immediately address the federal parliament and clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms. Merkel has to clarify whether an intentional murder strategy is part of the federal government’s Afghan policy, and whether the chancellor’s office, the military and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and his Green colleague Renate Künast demanded.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm rejected the criticism.
The chancellor has exercised no influence on concrete actions by the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also doubts over the Ministry’s presentation of the reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL information, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and thoroughly about the background of the attack on the convoys.
Officially it had been said that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and had hidden delicate details from the Minister.
However, from the environment of the two senior officials transcended that they had even pointed out to the Defense Ministry the existence of several reports, including a two-page document from Colonel Klein, who was at command, and a report from a field patrol.
Meanwhile, Wichert would have requested in a letter that the matter be clarified, reports the Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung.
No response has been received so far, he said.
The ministry did not comment on the reproaches made to it on Saturday and said that this would be clarified in the Federal Parliament’s investigation committee, which will be constituted next Wednesday.
The onyrian worlds
In a state of alertness, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of mentally ill people and drug addicts the boundaries between imagination and reality fade away.
As long as it happens during sleep, everything is in order.
When we lie down in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can surrender unhinderedly to the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, anyone who experiences sleep-like states during waking, or sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, is considered most of the time in the modern Western world as a madman or drug addict, or at least as a maniac.
But such images and voices do not only arise in the mentally ill or in the drugged.
The same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, sometimes make the boundaries between dream, madness and reality fade.
Alert states modified onirically can appear in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases we call them visions, and in the worst, madness.
Although triggers and effects can be distinguished, similar processes can be referred to by the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the psychedelic experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castañeda, shamanic possession states, and psychosis and hallucinations.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of neuronal communicating substances in the brain – especially dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine – is disrupted and the interaction between various parts of the brain is disrupted.
During a schizophrenic psychosis, complex hallucinations and mad thoughts often appear.
Gravity no longer has power over him.
The relationship between madness and sleep has occupied philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived hallucinations as a form of sleep in a state of vigilance, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, found in 1861 a "great resemblance of the state of madness with the onyrical states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the dishonesty, allocated formations, and mirrors of this."
It is the fall of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and scandalously colorful.
Gravity no longer has power over him, it’s floating near the roof of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind it, figures of demons with wings, with red flies like blood, deformed, scratching the teeth.
They are chasing him, kicking him with heavy, flaming boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pain throughout his body.
Striking and malignant voices resound from the walls and the radio.
He can no longer stand the voices that insult and offend him.
Henning T. pulls out two wires from the stereo, binds them to form a hanging node, and fixes them on a hook on the roof.
It goes up in a bowl and puts the nail around the neck.
and jump.
The rope is released.
What a lesson to you! cries the voices in a choir that revents the thumbnails, “Come to the clinic and let them cure you!”
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychoses, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
The cause of this was LSD.
His diagnosis is schizo-affective-paranoid psychosis, in addition he is manic-depressive, takes medication, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, and has been married for three years.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible anguish and the deepest despair, he says.
Hallucinations are a cruel reality.
Approximately one percent of the population falls ill at least once in life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the time those affected can no longer distinguish between the outside and the inside world, and fall into a state of over-excitation that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of greatness, relationship disorders, or persecutory mania.
Specifically spread is the hearing of voices: voices that give orders, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected person is no longer able to distinguish what is important from what is not, the brain can no longer filter disturbing signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like sleep, psychosis opens the doors to a stream of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centered on the subject, says professor Thomas Fuchs, chief medical officer at the general psychiatric clinic at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the center of events, everything has a meaning directed at him.
At the same time, he enters into a passive role, as in a dream, he feels overwhelmed by events and cannot organize them actively.
This is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general it is not possible to adjust reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, awakening, impossible.
Having experienced a hallucination once in your life
Unlike in a dream, Fuchs says, “the spatial and sensory structure of reality perceived in psychosis remains in principle as it is.”
Paranoid thoughts and hallucinations rely on reality, distancing from experience takes place in reality.
For researchers, it is still unclear why our brains make crabs.
According to Fuchs, exceptional states can cause anyone to temporarily lose contact with reality.
But not all people develop a psychosis.
Apparently there is a genetic predisposition for schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that in addition to genes there are also other determining factors.
The researchers assume that the affected suffer minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the neuronal maturity of the brain is affected at an early stage of development, such as through a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But it remains unknown how this alteration of the neuronal system occurs, which is not manifested at all for many years.
The influence of the environment also plays an important role – stress or a traumatic experience can be the triggers of a psychosis when there is already a pre-disposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis, as they interfere with the brain’s transmission system.
When the brain gets hot
The illogical thing about all this is that psychotic people suffer with their hallucinations and take very expensive medications to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says psychology professor Erich Kasten, of Lübeck.
Perceiving a hallucination as pleasant or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and visions for ten years and has analyzed the results in the book Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf (The unreal world in our head), published last year.
Hallucinations are among the typical accompanying symptoms of psychosis, but also, surprisingly, of many other diseases.
Among them are, along with psychic disorders such as boundary personality disorder or depression, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s and cranioencephal trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, the brains of healthy people also suffer hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, are made up of memories that are normally found to be suppressed.
They arise when the areas of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are hyperactive or are poorly curbed; when our brain warms up, but also when stimuli are lacking.
Drugs can cause this condition in the same way as brain damage or a psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, stress, love illness or other exceptional brain states.
Studien gab bis zu einem Drittel der Befragten an, mindestens einmal im Leben eine Halluzination erlebt zu haben.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16, lived in a small town of Mecklenburg-West Pomerania and attended a secondary school.
A common girl.
If it wasn’t for those images and the voices.
Sometimes, during the play, it happens that a dull guy with long, dark hair directs the word to him.
When she answers, the other students look at her asleep; no one, apart from her, hears or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl is a strange dreamer, but Sarah K. knows she’s not dreaming.
She’s awake and sees and hears that guy, just as she sees and hears the girl sitting on the seat next door.
You can even feel their presence, at least for a few moments.
It’s a nice feeling, he likes the boy.
Sometimes I wonder if she’s crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of visions are not real and disappear.
At night, the appearances are alarming.
Visions are often a burden.
When you are in class sometimes you can’t follow the lesson because the teacher – in his eyes and ears – is presenting a new companion, while for the rest explains the mathematical equations in a visible and audible way.
At night, the appearances are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room for the dream to come, which often comes late and is scarce, he does not know whether he is awake or dreaming, whether the images he sees, the strikes or the girl with bleeding cuts in her arms and legs, appear in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me in peace, scream to the figures.
Her parents and friends didn’t tell her anything, they thought she was crazy.
August 2009 Sarah K. Is 20 years old today.
She approved selectivity last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations disappeared.
Since she has come into contact via the Internet with psychologist Kasten, she knows she’s not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art by despair.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or suffers from a restriction of stimuli, it is very likely that after a while he begins to have hallucinations.
I think the brain is unemployed and is responsible for looking for entertainment.
Sarah K., a single daughter, was afraid of other children and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when, at the age of 13, he learned that the man he calls dad since he has reason is not his biological father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real impressions and noises, affected people like Sarah K. find it difficult to distinguish between visions and reality.
Hallucinations are also images that the brain produces, which is why they seem so real.”
Kasten also classifies night fantasies as a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations of healthy people do not fundamentally differ from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unreal.
Kasten therefore recommends his patients to appreciate their hallucinations as a special skill.
Difference between sleep and hallucination
In this world too centered on the conscious, imaginary experiences are usually pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, a professor in Heidelberg and head of the psychiatry and psychotherapy clinic at the Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a tough and painful illness but it also involves something positive and creative – madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated the so-called oneirism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as if it were a dream.
Hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person who experiences them considers real and that subsequently cannot differentiate from being awake.
Conscious states arise in extreme situations associated with trauma or illness, such as in patients with polyradiculoneuropathy, who experience motor paralysis while fully conscious.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of himself or the world due to a total and permanent motor disability, this replaces a very dangerous real situation with a world of his own and imaginary that is disconnected from reality.
This is the boundary between sleep and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, a world change occurs, although the real situation remains present in the imagination.
An intensive way of giving meaning and interpretation to an unbearable situation in itself that our own ability to create allows us not to sink into the nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory.
Art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen, from Zurich, also describes his onyrical experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as a salvation action of the soul.
He was 49 when his consciousness embarked on several-day trips after a heart valve operation with heart transplant included, while his body was condemned to immobility at the intensive care station.
Claussen plunged into a world created by him and visited strange places of other times: he was laid down in bed, an elderly man aboard a sanatorium in a train, a robot watched for his health.
He was seen in the high Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorcycle kidnapped him in his home country, surfed over his hospital bed in the Alps with snow firn and encountered a Korean mafioso.
He gives it all in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in the memories.
For Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, thus describing your experience.
On the contrary, the memories of mental travel are, many years later, much clearer, even in the irrelevant details.
More clear and intense even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilutes the horizon of the rest of our everyday experiences, adds psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneirism, psychosis, hallucinations and drug use show how fragile the inner reproduction of outer reality is, even when we are awake.
Every change in the state of consciousness, psychologist Kasten summarizes, “can lead to a deformation of what we call reality.”
An experience that, on the other hand, can be enriching.
The snow may come.
Bordeaux
The children will be in charge of the publisher at 27 years old
The new editor Kallen has come to a provisional solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two sons, he commented to SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg – Editor Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two sons become heirs at age 27 and have a firm will to enter the company, 69-year-old Burda confirmed to SPIEGEL.
The details have been fixed as a precautionary measure.
The next question is whether they will be actively involved in the company.
Also, if you are qualified for it.
One cannot put his children in front of 7,500 workers if they are not sufficiently trained to do so.
That would end up with the children and also with the company.
Burda announced on Thursday that he will retire from chairmanship in January and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been named his successor.
This member of the Kallen family, 52, has been a member of Burda’s management since 1999.
He was initially responsible for technology.
Later, he was in charge of the treasury and with it came the responsibility over the company's assets.After the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer also took charge of direct marketing, overseas, printing and finance.
For the first time, no member of the family occupies the top of the publishing house.
The sons of Burda are 19 and 17 years old.His son Felix, who would now be 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen’s designation also serves to, “save the differences of 10, 15 years,” according to Burda.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Looking at the Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda stated that family are also not safe from decay: “This has always affected families who let themselves be infected by the pursuit of capital, who have judged wrong and thought they could rise as well as the bigger player.
That was never my strategy.
I’ve never had “delusions of greatness,” says Burda.
I don’t see myself as a political preceptor of this country, as Springer was, and I also don’t want to play with “Time” in the world league; those have become too big.
Comprehensive Beauty
Everything – in terms of beauty and well-being – you can desire, at your disposal.
This is what seems to have been proposed by El Corte Inglés, which has just inaugurated in the shopping center of Callao (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and soaking of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, has prestigious firms such as Hedonai -which is responsible for laser hair removal- Spaxión, with relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments; Luis & Tachi hairdressers; Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding section, where the teteria stands out, with more than 130 different classes of this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while contemplating the immeasurable views of the capital, or rent for two hours the relax zone to mount your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relax with a session of jacuzzi, massages and taking a cup of champagne are some of the possibilities offered by Spaxión.
In total, 250 m2 are distributed in 12 rooms to carry out the latest and most novel facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
For example, cavitation to combat cellulite or vibrational platforms.
The gym also has these machines, as well as virtual ‘coaches’ who guide the customers’ steps, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
It all starts by entering your personal key onto a touch screen, located in front of the machine.
Then, several videos show us how to perform our exercise table correctly.
His director assures that 15 minutes (including heating and stretching) are enough to exercise all the muscles of the body.
And, if after exercising our body, we want to go through the hairdresser, the firm Luis & Tachi has a room where hair recovery rituals, luminosity or nutrition are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the premises of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 am to 22:00 pm.
Various Scots
Christmas is approaching and it is never too long to look at the stars to adapt them to our party dress.
The shape of the scout, very important to enhance the silhouette, is one of the variables we should consider.
Here are a few suggestions.
Singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated scout.
Endesa and Barcelona with electric cars
The electric company Endesa, together with the City of Barcelona, have created the 'Oficina LIVE'.
It is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The 'Office LIVE' (Logistics for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the implementation of the electric car in the city and will agreements around mobility, managing, coordinating, presenting subsidies, etc.
On the other hand, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
In short, it is intended to drive what will be the transport of the future.
Three electric cities
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the implementation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla are joining the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the Government, within the MOVELE Plan, to promote the implementation of the electric vehicle.
Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
It aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include activities related to energy and, in particular, energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative Endesa participates in in terms of the promotion of the electric vehicle.
The company participates in standardization groups at European level and has active a number of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees 'a peaceful horizon' for the motor industry
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, sees a “horizon of tranquility” for the Spanish automobile industry, which, he recalled, is the country’s main export sector.
In the presentation of the 2009 Economic Report of the President of the Government, Zapatero reviewed the measures the Executive has put in place throughout the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a landscape of abandonment, closure of some of our main productive plants," he said.
“Thanks to this plan and the availability of the brands to follow in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a horizon of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main exporting sector,” he added.
In this sense, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Integral Automotive Plan (PIA), allocated 800 million euros to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than 3 billion euros.
The chief executive explained that this investment was committed to both the development of new models and to modernize existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized government measures to support demand, in reference to the Plan 2000E, applied in collaboration with the autonomous communities and automobile brands.
According to the president, this plan has allowed to reduce by 6% the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in the Spanish market and has led to a "strong increase" of registrations, which grew "a 40 percent" in November.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classical Vehicle Show will be held in Madrid, a meeting space for professionals and motor enthusiasts.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Cristal Pavilion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters in which there will be more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only can you find motorcycles and classic cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid you will find items of all kinds related to the world of the motor.
Thus, among the exhibitors of the pavilion, accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, complements, publications, miniatures, etc. can be found.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the classic motor that will delight collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies will be Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, sale of cars; Juan Lumbreras, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Pueche sale and restoration of cars; or Cochera Clásicos, Mercedes Benz specialist.
Proof of Ability Abroad
In addition, the commercial activity of this Salon will be completed with parallel activities: celebration of concentrations, sports exhibitions, skills tests, presentations and competitions.
Skill tests with classic cars and motorcycles will also be carried out on an habilitated circuit outside the fair.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Sustainable sports
Mazda wants to demonstrate that sportiness is not intertwined with respect for the environment.
Therefore, the Mazda3 has just incorporated the engine stop and start system – dubbed i-Stop – a device that at least for now is only available with the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 horsepower.
This second generation of the Mazda3 stands out for the good score achieved in its entirety.
The finishes, the end of the vehicle, the habitability, the behavior, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting from the driving position, we check that the front seats present an excellent ergonomics and suction.
The touch of the wheel is also remarkable.
Following the set formed by the dashboard and the console, we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with a lot of buttons and commands and striking colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of what the Honda Civic also presents.
Therefore, we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
Continuing with the cabin, this Japanese compact car has more than enough habitability for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
There is also a large suitcase with regular shapes.
The automatic engine stop and start system, at least for now, is only available with the two-litre and 150 horsepower gasoline engine and with the manual six-speed transmission.
This engine is an authentic delight.It stands out for its fineness, its reduced noise, its performance and achieving contained consumption.
And it is that although the Mazda3 most sought after will be diesel versions, those who do not make an elevated number of kilometers a year should not discard this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its elevated walking comfort, as well as for its consumption content.
Regarding the level of equipment, the version chosen for the test is the so-called Sportive, that is, the one that incorporates a greater number of serial elements.
Of the standard equipment stands out especially the roll switching assistant (RVM) that removes the dead angle, the traction and stability controls, the speed control, the photosensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer on a large screen, the parking sensors, independent air conditioner, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and 17-inch alloy rails.
In addition, if it was little equipment, this version had the Premium Pack, which adds for 1,500 euros: adaptative bixenon beams and BOSE sound system with disk charger, among other elements.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in the class.
It stands out especially for the quality of the materials used, for their behavior and for the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not run many kilometers a year will be able to opt for this i-Stop version, associated only with the 2.0 150 horsepower gasoline engine.
The only inconvenience of this model is its high price, which is between the 21.770 euros of the Luxury finish and the 23.270 euros of the tested version -Sportive-.
In exchange for this high figure, the Mazda3 will offer us every day great doses of satisfaction.
The first luxury
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality from the hand of Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars shone more than ever wrapped in models as elegant as 'sexys' at the premiere of 'Nine'.
Our ‘Pe’, as sophisticated as usual, opted for a dark ‘Lady’.
The Promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at mail, without even the possibility of seeing certain kinds of attachments or browsing the network.
He his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is harder, the truth, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less than half of what is paid, for example, for the iPhone data plan.
In view of the success, the company has brought out two new devices: one exclusively designed for Twitter, the other with a lifelong free data service in exchange for paying six times more for the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It’s just as limited as its American counterpart, but comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance fee, about 12 euros per month, includes roaming across Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it’s like to have to give up data when crossing the border or desperately look for a cafe with WiFi (or a Fon connection) to be able to check the mail.
The idea of fixed-price roaming is incredibly attractive and should have been in operation for a long time.
Yes, some operators have special arrangements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a PhD in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the small letter.
The European Commission’s repeated efforts to affordable roaming rates across Europe have barely had a noticeable effect.
Outside the country of origin there is fear to use the data, and rightly.
That a device like FonPeek (it is curious that it bears the name of Fon when it lacks Wifi) gets this type of tariffs means that operators start to think differently and study different proposals with which to amortise their data network.
Kindle is another good example, including book download traffic and other internet queries.
Without contracts and without gaites.
It’s a connected device and you pay for it when you buy it, not month by month.
And that’s what I hope to see someday with FonPeek, a lifelong access shopping option like the one Peek already has in the U.S.
Not because I’m going to buy it.
I look at my email on the phone, thank you.
I hope it is because I think it is a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
The color of Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite tone of the American First Lady.
If he has already attended the inauguration of Barack Obama as President of the United States with a dress and coat of this color, he has chosen the same to accompany him in, undoubtedly, the second most important moment of his life: the collection in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has been wearing a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to being a similar color – yellow-green with bright reflections – the two-time suit was made up of three pieces – dress, jacket and coat of the same cloth – and adorned with a large bride or necklace.
So much so, that at first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States followed the roof of the Princess of Asturias and had opted to repeat dressing.
But the fabric on which the two costumes are made makes them very different.
If for taking possession it was a thick fit, in Oslo it is a terciopelo with stamped.
The accessories have also varied: half-tailed green shoes the other time, and a similar model, but in golden, now.
And equally different is the haircut: one collected this time, melena releases the previous one.
75% of working mothers have had work problems due to their maternity
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of the younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study ‘Fecundity and labor trajectory of women in Spain’, prepared by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Women.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 left no doubt: 75% of working mothers saw limited opportunities in the workplace due to maternity.
The study points out that there are many differences in the beginning of cohabitation in a couple and the number of children, depending on whether they work or not and the type of work they develop.
Those who do not have an activity outside the home, work part-time, or have a non-stable job, initiate prior cohabitation in a couple, advance the first maternity, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delay cohabitation and maternity, and have fewer offspring.
“Women aged between 35 and 49 with fixed work have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after starting cohabitation, a figure that increases to 4.1 women with fixed jobs have needed more time of their life trajectory to get them, which has led them to postpone the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of work performed exercises a lot of influence on maternity even less on the calendar of mating,” explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of studies is another of the factors that differentiate the age of women when they get married and when they have the first rapture.
According to the survey, the higher the educational level, the greater the age at which they marry and have their first child.
There are also differences between women of the same generation.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years old, those with elementary and higher education were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 on average, respectively.
"There is also another division among women according to their level of education.
While those who have elementary studies marry and have their first child before getting a stable job, those of middle or higher levels reverse this sequence and prioritize obtaining a stable job as a condition prior to marriage and the arrival of a child,” Delgado says.
Diane Kruger is too.
L’Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its envious list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become the image of different products of the brand, enthusiastically entering the universal motto of 'Because I'm worth it'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses in the international landscape, joins other famous L'Oréal Paris files, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter the club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly (‘Lost’) and Freida Pinto (‘Slumdog Millonaire’).
In the men’s section, the cosmetic brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (“Grey’s Anatomy”) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline’s partner in “Lost”).
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives – yesterday’s and today’s designers and models – gathered at the annual award ceremony, held in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one was missing at the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and daughter Georgia May Jagger have been named Best Model of the Year.
The game of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent gives in 'Póquer de ases' (Alfaguara, illustrations of Fernando Vicente) thirty radiographies of writers who have gone through their literary life (and, in cases, also the other).
He does not do it in the predictable and dreaded genres (biographical resemblance, life and work), but looking for something similar to the igniating core of the creator character.
The journey has its excitations and Vicent doesn’t spare any suspense or illumination.
In addition to an exquisite pleasure, the book is a moving invitation to readings and relectures.
Here I leave you a few instances.
“In his pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual pulse, almost physical, the same that I felt without giving it a name: pleasure against fate, morality without guilt, and innocence without any god.”
Nihilist, allegorical Christian, wrote what he had in his blood, not in his intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, meaningless, like the blade of the knife that was about to kill him.
About Graham Greene: "Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he conjugated the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted in reaching heaven through the path of perishing."
On James Joyce: "The 'Ulysses' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach.It is one of the eight-thousand-meter peaks of universal literature, which must be climbed by the northern wall, from which the best climbers are unleashed again and again."
William Faulkner: “He was a strange guy.
Of himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir of a county landlord and others that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
Both dreams were great.”
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the crazy shout thrown from a bridge by that Munich character to bring his echo to the bottom of the night of the twentieth century under his literary form and did so on a journey fleeing himself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to worms."
About Dorothy Parker: “One day she kneeled and prayed, ‘Dear God, please make me stop writing like a woman.’
About Joseph Conrad: "On his tomb were engraved these verses of Spenser: 'The dream after the effort, / after the storm the port, / the rest after the war, / after the hard life pleases death.'
About Virginia Wolf: "In the luggage I also brought her depression.
The husband accepted with all normality that she told her that Edward VII was spying on her among the Azaleas or that the birds sang in Greek.
It has never been the case of a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was ahead of his madness.”
About Pío Baroja: "What did Martin-Santos do but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try but to pass Baroja by Faulkner’s weapons?
What did Cela do but abduct that man’s fame to serve him as his own pedestal?”
cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother, about 70 years old, walked through our neighborhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years of age passed alongside her and our dog, an exemplar of the mestiza race, rescued from the puppy and with no more than six kilos of weight and, without a word, propinated him two paws that left the dog wounded.
Our indignation is major because we do not find the fun in a free aggression to a small, helpless animal, which, by the way, was tied.
To this we have to add the suffocation that provoked a lady who walked quietly and that, when she increpented these individuals, came to fear for their physical integrity, since an energy that attacks an animal, is able to do the same with a woman, a child, an elderly or, ultimately, with anyone who is more weak than himself.
The incident occurred at five o’clock on a Tuesday afternoon in a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we put a complaint at a nearby police station that we doubt it would serve for a lot and not generate susceptibilities, just clarify that the cowards murderers were Spanish.
The indignation has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening among young people so that they consider it fun to harass for free a helpless animal that gives us affection, company and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have gone.
Michelin and Fesvial together for helmet use
Michelin, with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the use of helmets, mainly among younger motorists.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness about the importance of using the helmet, as it is the only protective element capable of avoiding head injuries or even death in the case of an accident while driving a motorcycle.
Michelin said this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond designing and manufacturing ever-day safer products" and said it also contributes to this goal through other educational and informative actions.
This new campaign to promote the use of motorcycle helmets, under the motto ‘To be or not to be’, will have a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving maximum dissemination.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety “is a constant concern” for the company, since as a manufacturer of tires for two-wheel vehicles, one of its main purposes is to develop increasingly safe products.
Increased sales of light commercials
Nearly two years later, the light commercial vehicle market begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units that were registered in November in Spain represent a 12.6% rise compared to 2008 and, more importantly, represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of declines, according to figures from the patronal of the manufacturers Anfac and of the vendors Ganvam.
The good data, not unfortunate, should be put in quarantine since the reference with which the comparison is made – November 2008 – was bad, with a 60% decline relative to the previous year.
Consequently, despite the rise of the last month, the matriculations accumulated in these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, 95.853 units have been sold, totaling all the vehicles that make up the shale box of the light commercials: derivatives of passenger cars, pick-ups, vans, light vans and light trucks/chassis.
Likewise, the clouds that most affect their demand have not disappeared, because although they are also acquired by individuals, the majority of the purchases are made by small and medium-sized companies, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external financing.
Thus, to the restrictions imposed by the closed bank loans, other factors must be added, such as the increase in unemployment levels or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
In the face of this scenario and unlike the cars, the aid to the purchase of the 2000E has served little.
They can be welcomed, in addition to individuals, autonomous companies and SMEs that will acquire a lightweight commercial up to 3.5 tons with a level of CO2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometer, but the number of operations has been testimonial.
Yesterday, from Ganvam, they reiterated the need for the Administration to pay special attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The sales association predicts a 2010 similar to the year that ends, for which it calculates a fall in sales (of passenger cars and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency Braking Assistance is Now Mandatory
As with ABS brake anti-locking and ESP stability control, emergency brake assistance systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, they are already in all new-matriculated passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest there is a period of shortage until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase the protection of pedestrians although, by its way of working, it can also help to avoid many collisions by range.
The emergency braking assistant increases the pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency, which the system detects by the driver’s pitch.
But he doesn’t always hold that pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by car component manufacturer Bosch, a third of the drivers involved in an accident had not reached the brake before the collision, and half of them did not take full advantage of the force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, on the other hand, requires the maximum to the braking system, reducing the distance used by the car to stop.
According to a study by the EU, if all cars were equipped with this type of elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided per year.
The reduction will be even greater - it is estimated that one in four crashes with damage to people would be avoided - when the so-called smart emergency braking system is popularized.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (through a radar or a camera) detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
In case it does not react, and even if the collision is inevitable, the device exercises maximum effort on the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors delays plans for Opel until January
While workers at Opel’s plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April – probably on the 8th – according to Javier Ortega, the U.S. manufacturer warns that it will need more time to conclude the recovery plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, wants is that each of the points of the plan has been previously agreed by the affected party.
And this can cause the final document that will be submitted to workers first and then to the governments of the countries where there are factories to be delayed until the beginning of 2010.
GM said a decision on the sale of Saab would be made in the coming days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the U.S. manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to having contact with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, which also aspires to acquire Volvo, but forces the Dutch sports car maker Skyper, which is backed by the Russian group Converg.
In case there is no agreement with either of them, GM could sell some of Saab’s assets to China’s Baic.
It remains the decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it does not sell.
The Porsche Boxster Spyder
To develop its last, and expensive jewelry, the engineers of Porsche took the Boxster S as the basis and managed to lose no less than 80 kilos, which has left the base in only 1,275 kilos.
This led them to preserve, first of all, the automatic roof that has been supplemented by one of lona with manual drive, with which they save 21 kilos; using aluminum doors like those of the GT3, "fall" another 15; removing the air conditioner, 13; reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, they gained 7 kilos more; mounting sports bacquets another 12 and with the lightweight tires of 19 inches, five.
Finally, renouncing the CDR-30 audio system added another six kilograms and changing the door shooters for one of cloth, the remaining kilogram.
Although it is also offered with the PDK double embrace gearbox, the test was carried out on a six-speed manual gearbox drive, mainly on secondary roads in California, on mountain segments with really twisted tracks.
His behavior can only be called untouchable.
The weight reduction does not mean that the car does not step on the asphalt with sludge.
Rather, the opposite: it was a long time since we tested a model so small and lightweight that, at the same time, transmitted so much safety in the passage by curve, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, able to heat his muscles in a short run for the necessary time, until we order him to sprint, to brake, to recover and to re-press his engine.
Thanks to its address, as communicative as it is accurate, what we indicate with our hands on the wheel is what the car will do.
And it will do so with surgical precision.
Sound of the engine
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is very achieved and can be boosted with the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the braking of the engine, already premiered earlier in the Panamera.
The ability to accelerate is brutal, either from standstill or in recovery.
Suspension is firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we crossed with the Boxster Spyder was quite punished, but the car digested the beams well.
The electronic aid barely made an act of presence throughout the journey; and that in some of the curves we found ice at dawn and gravel, or in the morning.
In short, an ultra-light car, one of the most fun to drive one can on the market and that is something more than a simple modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010, at a price of 70.831 euros.
“Bag Girl”
Intima of Karl lagerfeld, image of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional 'starlette' of the 'maison' parades, the singer prodiges her face of malleable with as much contumacy as her Chanel bags.
More than ‘Bad Girl’ or ‘It Girl’, it’s a ‘Bag Girl’.
Baskonia wins victory in Israel
The Labour Box achieved a brilliant triumph by 82-91 in its visit to the complicated pitch of the Maccabi Electra, despite the numerous drops with which Dusko Ivanovic's team had, and in this way it is in the leadership of its group, after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, who with eight triples scored was the best of his team (29 rating).
The Victorian team supposed to supplement the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with large doses of involvement and collective work although he had to suffer until the end to win.
In addition, the great set from the perimeter, with 16 triples scored, had a lot to do with the final triumph.
The match began in front of the blaugranes, who put themselves from the start ahead in the scoring.
That the first four baskets of the Victorians were from the perimeter already suggested that they had jumped to the Israeli pitch with the hot dolls.
English and Teletovic were the main artists of the 18-20 at the end of the first half.
The second quarter was more of the same, but the Alavese team opted for Barac's interior game and Eliyahu's work, which was received with chicks and applause in the return to which his home was, to continue to expand their advantage at rest (34-43).
Teletovic already started to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although Splitter’s ‘minus six’ rating already made it seem that this would not be the best night of the Brazilian.
But the game, despite being driven to the rest, was not decided much less and the Macabeans wanted to remind the Victorians that on their pitch nobody wins, and with 'Elias's hand squeezing they managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the ‘yellow’ turning around the bright (50-49).
More inconvenience
Those of Ivanovic, injured but not so much dead, needed to fil a couple of games with the right to catch air, and in those came the machine gun of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and the help of English and Ribas returned the scoring to a tranquilizing income (54-67), which managed to makeup the locals at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alavesians went out to leave their skin in the last partial and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already warned that they would not let anyone take away what had been deserved during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to keep their team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated by faults, Ivanovic's did not rush, they defended well, and although the Israelis approached in the final minute (80-85), the match already had a master and the victory escaped from Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
Injury prevents fighting
The Unicaja lost strikingly in Greece against the Olympiacos and gave him the leadership of the group B of the Euroliga, in a match marked by the cashers’ lows, especially in the interior game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaguean team was not scared by the atmosphere of the Pavilion of Peace and Friendship, nor by the rival’s entity, one of the most potent in Europe and with a large budget.
The game shown in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream.An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two from base Omar Cook and one from Guillem Rubio, shone the locals 12-18, minute 9.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the locals in the interior game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, gave him the turn to the 22-20, 13th minute, point in which an action, conat of fight, between the two U.S. bases Beverley and Williams, meant the disqualification of both players.
The Greek set began to function by showing their superiority within both zones, where the loss by injury of English pivot Joel Freeland and Carlos Jiménez’s three personal flaws were lastering the cashers.
Between the domestic players and the Lithuanian ally Linas Kleizas, with their triples, increased the advantage 44-32, minute 19.
The Impossible Rise
The third period was very offensive with the Olympiacos, which despite the 19 losses, showed itself superior and even came to equate the difference from the match played in Málaga 66-48, minute 27, which made the group’s lead out.
The Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the last drop of Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, who was injured during the match.
Despite all the inconveniences the Unicaja for the direction and the triples of Cook, and the contribution of Lewis, left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was virtually impossible because the Olympiacos when tight and given their superiority in centimeters inside the area was unstoppable.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to remove the basket average 81-62, minute 37, and the Unicaja turned off, delivering the lead to the Olympiacos.
How much should you pay for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application from Trovit, the search engine with the highest number of classified ads of real estate, employment and engine in Spain.
The tool How much should you charge? calculates users’ salaries from the more than 140,000 job offers that Trovit has in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where they must enter their profession, years of experience, age and city where they want to work.
In the week that the app is in operation, the search engine has detected that in general the Spanish worker "feels badly paid," explained in a statement the product manager of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to Trovit’s data from its search engines in the UK and France, Spaniards are the worst paid.
A British computer programmer receives 45.226 euros gross annually and one French, 31.059, compared to the 24,000 that a Spanish receives.
In the same way, a driver receives 34,247 net euros annually in England, 25,751 euros in France and 16,420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst-paid job in Spain is that of a camarader, with 11.592 euros net annually; followed by that of a dependent, with 14.725 euros; and that of an operator, with 15.667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the network in the last three months are the driver, the half-day jobs and the social worker.
Brazil sets deadline for Zelaya's exit
The Brazilian government has granted Manuel Zelaya the right to stay in his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The Deputy President must withdraw from the diplomatic position by 27 January 2010, when his term of office would officially end.
Francisco Catunda, the business manager of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave the embassy before that date, where he has been a refugee since September 21.
"He is aware that he has to leave on January 27, at the end of his term, he has to look for another destiny."
The broadcaster also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the set deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the backing of the Brazilian government," Zelaya declared by telephone.
Following the November 29 elections (which resulted in the election of Porfirio Lobo), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this same week he attempted to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was finally frustrated by rejecting Zelaya's condition of political asylum that was intended to be imposed on him by the "de facto" government chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Many thanks
After the days of wine and roses since last spring in which asset inflation has been the dominant tone in the markets, uncertainty again reappears in the markets, which should not be strange since it is its natural state, in an environment in which agents make decisions about the future by uncertain nature.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetize debt with direct asset purchase and indirectly giving free bar of liquidity at rates close to zero for financial institutions to buy assets to discount.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have virtually ended and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, are beginning to throw some sand on the gear like the ECB did with its year-on-year auction next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of the reduction of risk premiums.
Stock exchange volatilities and corporate bond differentials have rebounded, although they remain far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States have been forced to socialize private risk and public debt is again affected.
Again there is a flight to quality and the US, Japan and Germany have been the refuge chosen by investors, provoking an expansion of the differentials of the eurozone countries with respect to Germany.
Spain had barely been affected by this episode of instability but in that came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new review to the lower of the rating of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty doesn’t go wrong to silence the advocates of moral risk who tried again to create a charge of conscience over the leaders of world economic policy for having stopped the destructive effects of credit restriction on job destruction, when what would have to be done is to decree a new Thanksgiving.
However, Dubai paints a tribal struggle between the emirs to recompose power in the emirates and that of Greece we have seen before.
A government that hides public deficit, elections and a new government that pulls off the blanket.
Prodi made it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that the Ecofin saved Hungary from a default on its foreign payments at the beginning of the year and that it would allow a euro-member country to breach its commitments.
What is logical is that the Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and make its citizens accountable for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of their public finances.
If, as we expect, we find ourselves in front of an episode of normalization of transitory risk premiums, after some excesses in leveraged positions, it would be within what was expected.
In the Spanish case, as long as our public debt differentials expand as well as European corporate bonds, we should not worry.
If the European differentials decrease and our differentials continue to expand, then it would be Spanish idiosyncrasian risk.
When our advanced indicators are forcing most study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to revise their scenario for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, that they return to charge with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not augure much life expectancy to their warning.
Again, it has all the appearance that it will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for the time being "prudence, friend driver".

The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies in which the energy strategy of Spain in the next two decades is debated these days.
After his intervention, followed by that of Gas Natural-Fenosa president Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press a pinch of what he had raised in the closed-door subcommittee.
For Iberdrola’s president, Spain needs to invest €50 billion until 2020 and another €60 billion between that date and 2030, as long as the nuclear power plants operating today remain open.
Otherwise, the necessary investments will not be 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
That is, Iberdrola considers that in the next decade the investments should not be aimed at increasing capacity in generation, but in distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020 onwards, the situation will change and we will have to increase the power.
Its stake focuses on both gas and coal plants with mechanisms for capturing carbon dioxide and, above all, renewable energy.
In this case, it considers that 18,000 new MW are needed, that is, with other "supporting energies".
Galán, who considers that the Sustainable Economy Law bill that the Government has just approved is in line with what his company has been claiming, did not want to make blood with the royal decree to encourage national coal consumption, which contradicts the policies of fighting climate change.
In his opinion, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this sense, despite the "pointed" measures, as the president of Iberdrola called them.
Whatever the case, Galán considers that investment decisions, although they are long-term, should be started because they take time to mature and a stable retributive framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus deal in 10 airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary for ground airport services, Swissport, will play the role of preferred partner of Irish airline Aer Lingus for cargo services at ten European airports where it has a presence.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are some of the most prominent.
The agreement, of which the economic terms have not transcended, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a collaboration protocol to create the Intelligent Infrastructure Innovation Centre
The alliance envisages an investment of 20 million until 2012, of which 50% corresponds to Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the center will be to investigate energy efficiency on highways and airports.
Acciona launches its first highway in Australia with Hochtief and Bouygues
She fights for her first concession highway in Australia, a market in which she already works as an energy and water management company.
The project is valued at 1.700 million Australian dollars (about 1.047 million euros).
The French Bouygues and sister Hochtief are their rivals.
A 5-kilometer tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the East Coast, has become the closest option for Acciona to sit in the country as a highway builder and dealership.
The City Council wants it to be ready by the end of 2014
After opting for public-private collaboration (PPP) to take the project forward, in a business plan protected by Erns & Young, the Administration has already a final list of candidates to make the work and exploit the toll.
Waiting for their offers to be presented in May, the projected investment amounts to 1.700 billion Australian dollars (1.047 million euros) and in the final phase three consortia with a notable presence of European constructors compete.
The group named Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish in liza, and its colleagues are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian constructors, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
Against the team of Acciona plays the consortium Northern Direct, with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French constructor group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that has passed the crash is the so-called LBRJV, where they share capital with the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German constructor Hochtief, in turn participated by ACS), the also local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the gala firm specialized in civil works Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large works and privatizations, but brings with it a clear difficulty of entry unless it is through the acquisition of a local construction firm.
A strategy that has followed the aforementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and that continues to be a pending subject for the Spanish giants of the sector.
Only ACS has achieved a position in that market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of the aforementioned Leighton.
Millions of assets
Acciona is committed to a geographical area of the highest importance for the sector, in which it already has a prominent presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination business.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind farm, Waubra’s (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies in charge of raising and managing the Adelaide sewer with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention now is to consolidate those two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the fields of construction and infrastructure operation.
The underground toll road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and called Northern Link (northern link), is called to join the western Toowong highway with the circumval road in Kelvin Grove (see map) along 5 kilometers of tunnel.
The calendar marked by the Administration sets the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the works in December of next year.
Despite the fact that this payment step would be opened to traffic in the last months of 2014, the project is not expected to be completed until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two tracks per direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will contribute 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) to its funding.
Brisbane offers business to Hochtief
Australia continues to give remarkable fruits to Hochtief, who announced yesterday that it has obtained a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
The participating ACS will enable, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national broadband network with fiber optic cable.
This action will offer fast internet access to 400,000 people and give the German job for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has passed the 27-story King George Tower construction project in the Australian city of Brisbane.The works were still to begin and Hochtief has closed the sale in 129 million.
Already in the UK, specifically in Manchester, he will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and operation of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment will be €75 million.
FCC to buy a tunnel in Slovenia for $64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, has awarded the construction of a 2.1-kilometer-long tunnel for a highway in Slovenia for a sum of 64.5 million euros.
The contract was signed days after the construction of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) for $130 million.
Alpine thus reinforces its expertise in the construction of tunnels.
The start of the works is scheduled for the beginning of 2010 and its execution period will be extended for 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore Adjudicates Renfe Advertising
Renfe has awarded the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to Ms. Rushmore for approximately three million euros annually, the railway operator said.
Ms. Rushmore has been chosen among the 16 agencies that submitted to the Renfe competition, four of which were finalists, including TBWA, who was responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on, Ms. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
France Télécom fined $63 million
The competition regulator in France has imposed a €63 million fine on France Télécom for anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean regions belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition in fixed and mobile telephony with the signing of exclusive agreements, price plans and consumer loyalty programs outside the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state company has accumulated more than €560 million in fines since 1994 for stopping its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday, in fact, has been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore recurrent.
The App Store
On the other hand, the mobile subsidiary of the French company has followed the footsteps of other operators and opened an app store on the internet, with the aim of increasing revenue that does not come from voice transmission.
In principle, Orange’s app store will be active in France and the UK.
We will have to wait until 2010 for it to reach other countries, such as Spain.
Playing the Champions has 476.4 million to Madrid and Barça from its origin
The Champions League has become a source of revenue for clubs since it was founded in 1992.
Real Madrid and Barcelona have earned 476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth club to earn the most money in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only provides glory, it is also one of the main sources of revenue for major clubs.
So much so, that the competition has distributed 5.362,5 million euros to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) that have participated in the event since the tournament was created in the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have gone well out of this division.
The white club has been the third on the continent that has earned the most money for participation, and the only one, alongside AC Milan, that has won the trophy three times.
The Catalan, the current champion and the last winner of the extinguished European Cup in 1992, is the fifth in the ranking.
The list is headed by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that, in addition, paid the most money for participating in the previous Champions League.
And that despite losing both in front of the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has achieved the most money through the Champions League, despite having achieved more titles than no other (five, for the four of Italy, three of England and two of Germany).
Distributed
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
For this exercise, the body that chairs Michel Platini expects to receive 1,090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money the UEFA will devote 413,1 million to the fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the previous round of qualification (including Atletico Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million only for being there, in addition to another 550,000 euros for each match they disputed.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and for matching (400,000 for each team). The eight-finalists will receive three million each; the eight quarterfinals, 3.3 million.
The last four will be paid $4 million each.
The winner will win $9 million, compared to the finalist’s $5.2 million.
Thus, in terms of fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
Barca, on the other hand, paid 2.5 million for winning the Super Cup in August.
But there are also variable payments, to which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main, and has four assigned places.
The winner of the previous year is left with 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other side will be paid according to the number of matches played in this year’s edition.
Nova Rumasa offers €61 million for 29.9% of Sos
The Nova Rumasa group uncovered the details of the offer to buy shares with which it seeks to acquire a top of between 25% and 29.9% of Sos’s capital.
A percentage that does not force you to launch a public offer of acquisition (OPA) for all securities.
In particular, Nova Rumasa offers 1,5025 euros per share that would be disbursed in 10 years and that would be remunerated with an interest for the postponement of 1% annually.
Yesterday, Sos shares closed at 1.85 euros; therefore, the offer of Nueva Rumasa values the company 18% below the market.
According to Nova Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the actual valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 councillors.
The Jerevan group gives a period of 15 days for shareholders to communicate their interest in selling bonds.
The CNMV said it had not been informed of the offer, despite the company of the Ruiz Mateos claiming that it had contacted the regulator.
If made, the disbursement would reach 611.7 million when the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure its address.
In an attempt to stay away from possible purchase offers and the judicial vows of his former managers, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, announced the election of María Luisa Jordá as internal audit director.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a senior position in the food company.
This is a new creation position that will depend directly on the chairman of the group.
And it is not exempt from controversy, as the company continues to be immersed in the legal battle for the alleged deviation of more than 230 million from Sos to Salazar societies.
In fact, it cannot be ruled out that over the next few months, Sos will reveal new fund deviations.
Regarding the credit to the Salazar, yesterday declared in the National Audience the former councillors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) and stated that they approved the deviation of 212 million without knowing their fate.
The CNMV authorizes Paternina’s exclusion opa presented by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) authorized the exclusion waiver presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on October 9.
The supervisory body has explained that it authorizes this operation by understanding that its terms are adjusted to current rules and considering the content of the explicative brochure presented after the modifications introduced on December 2.
The CNMV has specified that the offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, representing 8.95% of its social capital, which is made up of 6.142.786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao Stock Exchange.
Also, he explained that 5.592.778 million shares have been immobilized, which cannot be transmitted in any way until the end of the offer, of which he specified that the price has been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the current regulation.
New tools for driving cars
In these days of storms and accidents, not only car workshops win.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered a crash are removed to a workshop, where an expert must evaluate the damages suffered and what will be the cost of repair.
No accident is the same, and calculating the cost of parts and labor time can be a long and complicated task.
Manually calculate the cost of a repair of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including pieces and work, can take two or three hours.
Instead, with the support of the latest computer tools would be a matter of minutes.
That’s why almost 100% of experts use this type of systems.
Service providers and solutions for accident assessment and maintenance are dedicated to collecting the information supplied to them by manufacturers, then developing it and offering it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the American group Solera, is the leading firm; 80% of the valuations are made with its products.
The other firms that compete in the field of taxation tools and processing of industry information are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data supplied by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, in Spain they work with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them supplies the information in different formats.
In addition, the amount of data to be treated does not stop increasing, to the point that in the last five years the same versions, variants and motorizations have been released than in the previous fifteen years.
As soon as a new car comes out on the market, these companies start to work.
It is a very arduous job, because you have to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and enter its price.
In addition, a "smart" graphic image is made of each model where different parts of tourism can be "pinched".
If it is a massive window model, the work may be ready in a week if the process goes very fast.
If it is a minority car, it can take three or four months.At present, Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of the cars that are marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models are information about Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the mobile park that runs, they exceed 99%.
To carry out the documentation work and the elaboration of the databases, Audatex has eight centers distributed around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them is specialized in specific brands.
The headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros annually in developing these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data is included, and customers receive updates every two days.
The elaboration of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer varied products.
The most frequent use is focused on repair and maintenance, but according to which countries there are also tools for the management of waste parts or to calculate the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that reports on the value of the used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but it does in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support they can provide to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star product AudaPlus, the standard accident assessment solution, intended for experts.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light or heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint bars.
This tool is paid according to use, for each evaluation.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which performs thousands of peritations, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the full identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it left the assembly line only by its trunk number.
AudaGlass focuses on the moons of vehicles, and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional sector on the internet that allows you to ride by vehicles declared total accident.
Its statistics service is very useful for identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analyses or knowing the deviations by model brands.
You can study, for example, how many models of a given brand have passed through the workshop due to failures or how many have suffered serious accidents in a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It markets, among others, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, failure or maintenance of the automobile.
The Gt Guide is its historic product of reference in the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Their business volume has grown at a rate of 20% annually in the last three years, and in 2008 they accounted for €10.8 million.
At the beginning of last year they started their process of internationalization, with the installation of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company’s sources, 62% of its business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America.
The worldwide turnover of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will earn 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera group was worth $1 billion on the stock market, and now its shares are listed for a total value of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007 it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's index.
Online auction of accidental cars
Last October, the Solera group bought Autoonline, an internet platform for the sale of cars as well as motorcycles or special vehicles.
The transaction involved a disbursement of €59.5 million for 85% of the company’s capital, which could be expanded next year to the remaining 15%.
The aim of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing an immense international market.
This valuation and sale service is exclusively aimed at professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, renting companies, workshops, washers and professional sellers who must register before starting to carry out operations.
Established in 1996 in Germany, the platform manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
3000 ads are managed daily and about 100 new ads are included in the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose shuttle number has been given off can not be used again, but certain parts that are not damaged can be used as a replacement.
Cars with historic value can be given off even if they have been given off after a rough handling.
Workshop budget in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company Audatex ensures that the user gets a budget in just four steps: identify the vehicle, search for the spare part, create a budget and generate a budget.
The ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially to convince older professionals, who are more or less reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 passenger cars, 109 all-terrain vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
To use it, a computer with an internet connection is required.
Once the model to be repaired is identified by its shutter number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and then the necessary replacement is selected.
The user can include variables such as labor price, charges or discounts, and then print the budget to deliver to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a rating tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented system does not include estimated workforce times.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the customer can finance.
Currently, the company Audatex is working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with very good eyes, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it around to see the inside face.
