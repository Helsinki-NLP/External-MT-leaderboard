The overall incidence of coronavirus (COVID-19) infections increased rapidly in the EU/EEA countries and the UK from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The overall prevalence of the coronavirus (COVID-19) infection in one of the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom indicates that, despite the varying levels of prevalence across countries, the COVID-19 outbreak is spreading rapidly across all countries.
Based on the experience in Italy, countries, hospitals and emergency departments should be better prepared to accommodate the high number of COVID-19 patients who will need care, especially in the case of patients with disabilities.
On December 31, 2019, a case of epilepsy was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, from an unknown cause.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Agency for Disease Control and Prevention announced that it was infected with a new coronavirus now known as the highly contagious respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been referred to as coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far shows that about 80% of COVID-19 cases are mild, with or without respiratory illness, and most are cured.
In approximately 14% of patients, COVID-19 results in a serious illness requiring hospitalization, while in the remaining 6% patients, it is a medical condition requiring emergency room care.
The number of hospitalized deaths from COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this study, we assess the overall COVID-19 infection statistics in each EU/EEA country and the UK (UK) and compare them with those in Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK with those in Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK
After China, COVID-19 has continued to spread to other countries and the spread of COVID-19 to other parts of the world is similar to that in China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 an epidemic.
In the issue of Eurosurveillance 2020, dated March 5, Spiteri and colleagues reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to WHO patient definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were confirmed by France on 24 January 2020 among people who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, there were no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in all 30 EU/EEA member states and the United Kingdom (UK), with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported between today and 31 December 2019, of which 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths were in Italy alone.
Getting the overall number of COVID-19 cases and overall prevalence
In the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), the global COVID-19 case statistics, reported by country, are provided by reliable sources such as the Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities and WHO, and are updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
This data was used to assess the status of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK, and to compare it with that in Italy.
To reflect the current status of COVID-19 cases, we have compiled COVID-19 infection statistics over 14 days, so we focus on the normal transmission of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA member state and in the UK, from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also reported the number of cases reported by each country since March 15, 2020 at 8:00 a.m. compared to that of Italy between January 31 and March 15, 2020.
The current COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK
The overall overall COVID-19 status in the EU/EEA and UK over the past 14 days is similar to that in Hubei Province, China (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and UK as a whole, the number of COVID-19 cases started to rise around 21 February and will now rise to a peak around 28 February 2020 (Additional Document).
This was mainly due to the high incidence of COVID-19 cases in Italy, but also in all other EU/EEA countries and the UK (Additional Documentation).
Figure 2 shows a comparison of the number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and UK and Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It shows that, by March 15, 8:00, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already reported a total of cases equal to or below Italy's 3 weeks earlier.
Our conclusions suggest that the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases will increase rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The changing overall prevalence of COVID-19 indicates that the epidemic is spreading at the same rate across countries.
This is despite the fact that countries have different levels of testing, health standards are changing, and infection rates may vary from country to country and there are different protocols for selecting patients to be tested for COVID-19, including testing for those who have not yet passed the test.
In early March 2020, doctors in affected areas in Italy reported that up to 10% of COVID-19 patients needed emergency room care and that emergency hospitals in those areas had already received no more than 10% of the emergency room care.
Data on COVID-19 hospitalized or acute care patients currently available at EU/EEA level are currently only 6% and 1% of patients (data not available).
However, it must be thoroughly compiled to aggregate data on current patient tracking with a focus on the number of patients identified by the number of deaths.
A 2010 study found that the number of beds in the emergency room and emergency room in Europe varies from 29.2 beds in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less infrastructure than Italy (they had a healthy and healthy beds of 12.5 per 100,000 in 201011).
The sixth document, which includes the latest data from the ECDC's rapid COVID-19 outbreak assessment, presents examples of over-care cases, accompanied by a comparison of each EU/EEA and UK country's COVID-19 hospital-acquired cases and 90% of their outpatient cases.
As some areas of the EU/EEA and the UK are currently the most frequent patient centres and emergency departments generally accept people from a specific area, patient and emergency bed information should be available at the NUTS-2 population statistics level.
Italy's example and the situation in other countries indicate that the COVID-19 outbreak is spreading rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and emergency departments must prepare to cope with the SARS-CoV-2 infection that will continue in the population as the number of COVID-19 cases requiring care increases, especially in the case of patients with disabilities, as is happening in the affected areas of Italy.
As stated in the recent Emergency Response Report of the ECDC, it is essential to use a rapid and early general approach to prevent the spread of SARS-COV-2, thus replacing the preventive approach with a stay-at-home stay, as the expected increase in the number of patients may cause decision-makers and hospital staff to lack sufficient time to analyze, agree on and implement appropriate measures if not taken early.
A rapid case study outlines public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There are few opportunities for countries to take further action to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and its health effects.
If this is not done, health authorities in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a significant number of patients who will be ill in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), caused by the highly contagious respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus, has killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and around the world, making it a humanitarian disaster.
Like another similar virus, SARS-CoV, which infected thousands of people with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can also be transmitted by mosquitoes with similar and identical symptoms.
However, COVID-19 is less severe and less lethal than SARS, although it is more common in adults than in young people and more common in men than women.
Given the growing number of reports on this new disease, this paper attempts to provide a comprehensive and useful review of the increasingly researched topic.
We focus on the main factors such as the diagnosis of the disease, the cause, the virus that causes it, how it is diagnosed, how it is treated, how it spreads and how it is prevented.
While there are still many questions to be answered, we hope this review will help identify and eliminate this life-threatening disease.
After the Spring Festival on January 25, 2020, made a memorable history for all Chinese people who were asked to stay home for all holidays and weeks following the pandemic caused by the new virus.
The virus has many similarities to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the 2003 SARS outbreak; thus, the WHO designated it SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020, and the disease-causing virus is now known as CoV 19 (COVID-19).
The outbreak began in Wuhan, China, and has spread across the country and to about 50 other countries worldwide.
As of March 2, 2020, more than 80,000 people had been confirmed infected with COVID-19, of whom more than 40,000 had been discharged and more than 3,000 had died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is a General Enemy 1 and that it can have far more serious consequences than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 reports on COVID-19 have been published, including on the virus that causes, its outbreak, origin, evaluation and treatment since the first report was released on 7 January 2020 describing the viral patterns that had been detected in different patients.
This review attempts to summarize the current research on this new and highly researched topic.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other COVID-related diseases, such as Middle Eastern influenza (MERS, identified in 2012).
We will review the lessons we have learned so far on prevention and identification of the cause of the disease and some of the most pressing unanswered questions.
Viruses of the common CoVs, which are generally considered non-fatal viruses, are the main cause of the 4 most common types of influenza at a rate of about 15%.
However, in this century, we have encountered two of the most common human-infected CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused outbreaks in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and then spread to countless other countries with countless infections and deaths.
This is why the current COVID-19 is the third most common COVID-19 outbreak in human history.
As shown in Figure Figure 1.1, cases of epilepsy caused by an unknown event were first reported in Wuhan on December 31, 2019 and were reported to the National Health Commission of China.
A document describing the status of the CoV was published seven days later.
The first death in Wuhan occurred on January 15, 2020.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to other cities, provinces and neighboring countries.
20 In January, it was announced that some doctors were infected, of course, with the virus being transmitted to humans.
On 23 January, Wuhan was quarantined and all forms of public transportation were suspended.
On January 24, the first clinical trial of the disease reported that, out of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 had reached the Wuhan seafood market, which was believed to be the site of an unidentified animal-borne infection.
On 30 January, the WHO declared the pandemic a global health disaster.
At the time of this report, the disease had already spread throughout China and to about 50 other countries worldwide (Figure (Figure 2).
Given the rapid spread of this epidemic, it is difficult to predict its outcome.
On 11 February 2020, a cross-agency study of 8,866 patients with 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19 provided a more updated picture of the current outbreak on the web (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infections occur in people of all ages, but are most common in people aged 30 to 65.
About half (47.7%) of the infected individuals were over the age of 50, with a few under 20, and only 14 of the infected individuals were under the age of 10.
The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among men is higher (0.31/100,000) than among women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has been particularly prevalent in Hubei and surrounding areas.
The average time from COVID-19 detection to test arrival is approximately 5 days (2-9 days).
It took an estimated 4.8 days (3.0-7,2) for symptoms to manifest.
The first human died 9.5 (4,8-13) years after its appearance.
The baseline infectious potential (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3,51-4.05), and the R0 prevalence was 2.23-4.82.
The number of cases increased sharply before 23 January 2020, coinciding with the peak of travel before the Spring Festival in China.
The confirmed infection rate was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1,86%), and the overall mortality rate among all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main issues with COVID-19 were gender (male), age (â¥60), and acute obesity.
CoVs are a subset of large viruses with single-stranded RNA.
They can be classified into four types: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta. In these types, alpha and beta-CoVs are the most likely to infect humans.
The head-on glycoprotein (S) binds to the ACE2 and DPP4 genes in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and then the genes bind together.
The viral RNA genome is detected and transferred to the cell; once the viral RNA is copied, the genome RNA is composed of glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins that synthesize the nucleic acids that bind to the plasma membrane into viruses.
The first SARS-CoV-2 genome variant was identified on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new strain of beta-CoV that was 99.98% genetically homologous in 10 gene tests taken at the outbreak's onset at the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 has genes that are more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
In an electronic transmission microscope, SARS-CoV-2 fragments were detected in highly degraded areas of the human respiratory system.
The ACE2 human gene was found to be a combination of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 is more slowly binding to human ACE2 than SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the confirmed infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 in patients less severely than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 may also be a novel short protein produced by the orf3b protein and a discovery protein produced by the orf8 protein.
The orf3b protein in SARS-CoV-2 may be involved in viral pathogenesis and inhibit IFNÎ² manifestation; however, the orf8 protein does not have any known sequence or conditions.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou and colleagues announced the creation of a cryogenic electron microscope using a low-temperature (cryom-EM) detector of the total human ACE2 at a depth of 2,9 Ã in a molecular formula that converts the amino acid B0AT1.
The protein, which is open- and closed-loop in structure, is found to have double-cluster structure and the ACE2-B0AT1 protein can bind to two S proteins, which is a sign of the presence and transmission of the CoV virus.
B0AT1 can be studied in the testing of antibodies for SARS-CoV-2.
The first animal to be contaminated
Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to have originated from influenza and then infected humans with smallpox and measles.
Using a comparison of SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs, it was determined that the viruses are SARS-CoV-2's direct ancestors as the new virus is 96% homologous and two SARS-like CoVs are viruses of the bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
But the first infected animal that helped the virus spread to humans is unknown, and the exact method of transmission is not known.
Ji and colleagues suggested that snakes may have been responsible for the human transmission of the virus, which was later discovered in the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, have suggested that mammals, long-muzzled mammals and most commonly used by Chinese medical professionals, may have been the first SARS-CoV-2 infection due to the 99% genetic mutations identified in the bacterial CoV virus and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference between the two genomes is still large; therefore, conclusive evidence is awaited (Figure (Figure 33).
Most of the symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 are unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses can survive outside for up to 48 hours in hot climates, up to 5 days in temperatures below 20 Â°C and a mean temperature of between 40% and 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar characteristics.
SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to be sun-resistant and to have a temperature of 56 Â°C in 30 minutes; ethers, 75% ethanol, chlorinated detergents, peracetic acid, corophorum, and other fatty solvents, but not cororegicidins, can effectively kill the virus.
In general, all people are not immune to SARS-CoV-2 and are therefore susceptible to the novel virus.
There is currently no extensive research on the body's response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we only use previous studies on other CoV viruses, specifically SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure (Figure 4).4).
Generally, once the virus has entered the infected person, it is first identified by a natural receptor-specific receptor (PRR) containing receptors such as C-type reginets, TLR receptors, NLR receptors and RLR receptors.
In a variety of ways, the viral infection causes fever, inflammation of the retina, and the buildup of I-type protein (IFN) is produced to counter viral infections that slow the spread of the virus and re-infect the pathogenic virus.
However, the N-protein of SARS-CoV may help the virus to become an immune system.
Soon, the immune system begins to fight the virus.
T cells are composed of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that play a key role in the immune system.
CD4+ T cells increase the capacity of B cells to form immune systems that can resist the virus, and CD8+ T cells kill the virus-infected cells immediately.
T cells produce fuel cells to help protect cells.
But CoV can impair T cell function, causing T cell death.
Fluid resistance, which includes synapses such as C3a and C5a and immune system, is also useful in the fight against viral infection.
For example, immune responses from a recovered patient have weakened MERS-CoV.
Furthermore, excessive immunity to immune system disorders leads to a large number of immune cells that can cause severe lung and other organ damage, and then, if not, organ failure and death.
SARS-CoV-2, which was first identified in early infections, is more common in older people with other diseases than in pregnant women.
People who are infected with more viruses or have a dysfunctional immune system are often at higher risk of infection than others.
The average length of time SARS-CoV-2 stays in the body before symptoms are manifested is between 1 and 14 days, usually between 3 and 7 days based on a study of 425 initial cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 patients showed that the time it takes for symptoms to appear is 3 days in total and ranges from 0 to 24 days.
The most recent study, as mentioned above, showed that the time it takes for symptoms to manifest is 4.8 days (3,0-7,2) based on a total of 8,866 patients.
It is vital that health authorities set the right time frame based on the timing of the symptoms to be as clear as possible, thus preventing infected but symptom-free people from infecting others.
In general, people who have been exposed to infection or have been infected with the virus are required to quarantine for 14 days.
What if the deadline is extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the first major symptom of COVID-19, and may not be accompanied by any other symptom or symptoms such as coughing, shortness of breath, nausea, dizziness, headache, sore throat, multiple influenza, chest pain, dizziness, vomiting and dizziness.
Some patients have difficulty breathing or low blood oxygen levels within a week of diagnosis.
Patients with severe respiratory problems, low blood pressure, fatty acid problems and hypertension are immediately diagnosed.
Patients with fever or symptoms of respiratory and fever, even if they do not have symptoms of pneumonia, should be screened for the virus early.
A study of patients in late December 2019 found that the prevalence of symptoms was 98% for fire, 76% for cough, 55% for oxygen problems and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients requested a respiratory device.
The following conclusions were reached in two recent studies of family and non-symptomatic individuals.
Similar to the current study, a 2012 study of infections showed that MERS-CoV patients also experienced fever (98%), colitis (47%) and oxygen deficiency (55%) as primary symptoms.
But 80% of them applied for respirators more than those with COVID-19 and the death rate for MERS is higher than for COVID-19.
Fever (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also reported in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), colitis (29%-75%), oxygen deficiencies (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%) and sore throat (13-25%) were found to be the most severe symptoms in patients who applied for respiratory machines at about 14%-20%.
On 14 February, the COVID-19 death rate was 2% when the global number of confirmed cases was 66,576.
As with the virus, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases in November 2002.
For MERS, based on a June 2012 infectious survey, the mortality rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
Previous studies have shown that the baseline prevalence (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 6.47, the 95% prevalence (CI) was 5.71-7.23, while the R0 for SARS-CoV was only between 2 and 4.
The comparison of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV for symptoms, mortality and R0 is shown in Table Table 1.1.
The data already available shows that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher potential for transmission than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it kills fewer people than the others.
This is why the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is more resistant than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The traders often appear in the same family or in the same meeting or car as the boat they travel on.
Patients often have been in or travelling to Wuhan or other affected areas or have had contact with infected or sick people within the two weeks prior to their arrest.
However, it has been shown that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients who have recovered and been discharged from the hospital may still have the virus, suggesting the need to extend the incubation period.
Patients have a normal or low number of white blood cells (especially stem cells) in the first few days.
For example, the lowest level of stem cells in white blood cells is 4Ã109/L including stem cells 1Ã109/L, while the highest levels of asiparate aminotransferase (AST) and viral plasma were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The levels of dark matter and chemicals and myogorbines have increased in the blood of some patients, and the accumulation of dark matter and erythrocytes proteins has increased in the blood of many patients.
In patients with severe D-dema, the bleeding from fibrin damage in the blood was high, and the number of stem cells decreased.
Problems with the pulmonary emptying system are common in most COVID-19 patients and are characterized by either congenital or congenital obstruction of the lungs (GGO).
Patients often experience abnormal diarrhea, swollen lungs and severe respiratory problems (ARDS).
In the case of severe respiratory distress (ARDS), extreme heat, accumulation of fluid and abnormal pulmonary embolism are a major threat to air circulation.
Inactivity of pinemosites type I and II reduces the level of the lymphatic system which reduces the spacing between the lymph nodes and increases the muscle mass, thereby reducing the pulmonary capacity to contract and increasing the risk of pulmonary failure.
Therefore, negative radioactive reactions are often associated with an increased risk of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the initial analysis of the COVID-19 outbreak revealed a pinemosite incidence, inflammation of the lungs, a large cell base in the respiratory tract, and a large number of heart-attached cells in the lungs of the patient who died from the disease, which corresponded to the origin of viral infection and severe respiratory distress (ARDS), as well as in SARS and MERS patients.
The RNA recognition of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using the RT-PCR laboratory method has been used as the main standard for COVID-19 testing.
However, due to the high rate of false positive responses, which could lead to further spread of the disease, the symptoms began to be used in screening (not just RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
The same was true of the SARS test.
Therefore, linking medical history, symptoms, laboratory tests and metastatic test results is important and necessary for proper testing.
On February 14, 2020, a team led by Feng Zhang described a protocol to use the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK method to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects RNA fragments of SARS-CoV-2 at a scale of 20 Ã 10-18 mol/L to 200 Ã 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microloliter of input) using a amavutta test in less than an hour without requiring major materials.
It is hoped that this new approach could significantly improve its effectiveness if it is monitored in clinical trials.
Due to the lack of adaptation to the new CoV, doctors may be able to be close to patients with COVID-19 in the first place, while testing various prescribed or desired medicines before treating other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table (Table 2).2).
The drug includes a combination of antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-inflammatory drugs, plasma from healthy patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Plasma extracted from healthy patients is recommended for viral treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are not currently working to develop immune systems and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 is primarily associated with the early lung and can also, at a lower rate, infect other ACE2 functioning tissues such as the liver and kidney.
However, poor functioning and inactivity of respiratory systems are the most serious health problems and the leading cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential for symptom reduction and rescue and includes general ventilation, air maximization, ventilation and ventilation due to the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory distress symptoms should be advised to use ECMO ventilation, a replacement for the cardiovascular and lung respiratory system used to treat patients with severe cardiovascular or respiratory problems.
Furthermore, the maintenance of renal function, prevention and treatment of other diseases and low blood pressure, and maintenance of key organ function are also beneficial for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is known that increased cytokine levels are associated with an over-reaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Stocrine hypertension is a process of synthetic immune response characterized by the detection of various cytokines such as TNFÎ±, IL-1Î², IL-2, IL-6, IFNÎ±, IFNÎ², IFNÎ³ and MCP-1.
These toxins cause the immune cells to release a large number of unstable cells which are the main cause of ARDS and the failure of various cell types.
Reduced muscle tone is useful in treating hypertension, especially in patients with obesity.
Corticosteroids and tosilizumab, a single-coron anti-IL6 antibody, have been used to treat cytokine hypertension.
Other anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of cytokine hypertension include reducing the anti-T cell immune system; inhibiting IFN-Î³, IL-1, and TNF; inhibiting JAK; inhibiting cytokines; reducing cytokine symptoms 4; and inhibiting HDAC.
Anti-inflammatory drugs, such as anti-inflammatory drugs, have been widely used to treat SARS to reduce the severity of the immune response.
However, the use of anti-inflammatory drugs has not been effective in the treatment of severe swelling in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Rather, it can cause serious complications, especially osteoarthritis (AVN), which has a significant impact on the treatment of the disease.
However, it is desirable that the lowest doses of corticosteroids should be given to patients with severe COVID-19 in a short and cognitively impaired period.
At the time of writing, a healthy anti-virus was also found in a person.
But remdesivir injections, similar to nucleotides, have been shown to be beneficial for COVID-19-positive Americans.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir was also shown to inhibit other RNA viruses including MERS and SARS.
Based on the above, Gilead has provided the vaccine to China for two studies on SARS-CoV-2 infections, with a highly anticipated outcome.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-Î±, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been shown to be effective in treating patients with symptoms of severe respiratory problems.
Diarrhoea, diarrhoea, vomiting, diarrhoea and other serious problems may occur as a result of the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these medicines with other medicines used in patients should be closely monitored.
Purzam was extracted from patients who had recovered from the immune system.
The collection of blood from people who have recovered from infectious diseases for the treatment of other patients with the same disease or for the prevention of non-infectious diseases has been practiced for a long time.
Yes, healthy patients often have a high immune response to the virus in their blood.
The body's immune system is a body-regulated immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B-cell stem cells to fight viruses and other unusual agents that detect only viral molecules and then kill them immediately.
Based on the above, plasma was extracted from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and then injected into 10 seriously ill patients.
The symptoms began to subside within 24 hours, with a decrease in the incidence of diarrhea and an increase in viral load and oxygen levels in the blood.
However, the analysis is essential to provide a way to use it in more patients without specific treatment.
Furthermore, due to the effects of drugs, some of the adverse effects associated with plasma must be considered with caution.
For example, the immune system can greatly increase the immune system and then produce toxins, which can be life-threatening toxins.
The body's immune system is usually low in blood and high levels of plasma are needed to treat critically ill patients.
It is not easy to build a specialized immune system fast enough to fight an international pandemic.
It is therefore necessary and appropriate to remove B cells from healthy patients and then to replace the genes of the active immune system or to examine the active immune system as compared to the essential proteins of the virus.
We are able to do more than our natural body.
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of ailments in China.
But its function is based on the interaction of different drugs in a flexible manner with the diagnosis of disease based on the method used in TCM.
Many of the medicines that are effective are not known or well known because they are difficult to obtain and control or measure their efficacy.
Today, due to the lack of specific therapies for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the leading complementary therapies for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or patients who have recovered.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen's drops have been shown to be effective in treating COVID-19.
High rates of recovery from COVID-19 were observed in several provinces in China that used TCM in 87% of their patients, such as Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while in Hubei Province, which used TCM in only about 30% of COVID-19 cases, the recovery rate was extremely low (13%).
But this is an unambiguous comparison because many other factors such as patient count and health status must be considered in the test.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing European and American-only drug therapy with combined WM and TCM.
They found that the time required for normal body temperature recovery, symptom recovery and hospitalization was much shorter in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group.
Interestingly, the severity of symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group (7.4% to 46.2%) and the lower mortality rate in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group (8.8% to 39%).
However, the effectiveness and accuracy of TCM remains to be studied in greater detail across a wide range of individuals and institutions.
It is also advisable to demonstrate the efficacy of these medicines and to clarify the usefulness of TCM medicines when used alone or in combination with others where possible.
Patients suspected or confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 are often more likely to be at risk of serious infectious disease and death, and if quarantined they may experience a negative response, loneliness and anger.
Also, infectious symptoms such as fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea and adverse drug reactions such as corticosteroid insomnia can lead to increased stress and mental health problems.
At the beginning of the SARS epidemic, a variety of mental health conditions were identified including chronic depression, anxiety, fear, panic attacks, dementia, headache, and suicidal ideation.
The search for contacts and the enforcement of COVID-19 quarantine measures by government health authorities can increase the level of anxiety and guilt about the consequences of infection, isolation and discrimination against family and friends.
Mental health services should therefore be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected contacts and others in general need of assistance.
Emotional support should be accompanied by the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, a clear way to constantly exchange up-to-date information about the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and a way to provide patient care and use of technology tools and software to prevent people from getting together.
Effective vaccines are essential to prevent infection between viral animals and humans infected with other animals or potentially infected humans and are often complementary to antiviral agents in the fight against infections caused by new viruses.
Progress has been made in the development of S-protein-based vaccines to develop a long-term immune system or to increase the immune response to SARS-CoV.
Vaccines using weakened viruses were tested on animals for SARS.
However, the efficacy of this vaccine in animals or in healthy older adults and in preventing transmission of animal viruses cannot be determined without clinical studies.
This may be because 17 years after SARS disappeared, no one else has ever been infected.
On the other hand, a small number of MERS cases remain in the Middle East and the virus is spreading to other areas as animals continue to infect humans in areas affected by the virus.
Measures have been developed to prevent MERS using deprived viruses, DNA purasimides, viral vegetation, excess particles, viral-like particles and protein-derived particles and some of these measures have been studied in animals.
The development of an effective and safe SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for people without immunity is essential and urgent in order to combat the epidemic.
However, this problem is difficult to solve due to the long time (approximately 18 months) required for vaccine development by mutations in CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has begun to demonstrate its potential in thousands of patients.
Patients can often recover gradually without suffering any effects.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also more prevalent and deadly among patients with severe illness.
Therefore, the development of a treatment plan is essential to ensure that hospitals and clinics can effectively use their services or in areas with insufficient facilities.
Based on clinical studies to date, the following factors may affect or contribute to the development of COVID-19 patients (Table (Table 33):
Age: Age is the most important factor in the diagnosis of SARS, as is COVID-19.
COVID-19 affected mainly those aged between 30 and 65 years, of whom 47.7% were over 50 years of age in a study of 8,866 patients as described above.
Patients who applied for emergency room admission often had other medical conditions and problems and were much older than those who did not apply (average age 66-51), which means age is a factor in the prevalence of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: According to the WHO, males are the most commonly infected with SARS-CoV-2 (0.31/100,000) than females (0.27/100,000).
Multiple Heart Disease: COVID-19 patients who require emergency room treatment often have heart problems that have become severe and inflammatory.
Heart disease has also been a major cause of death in SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 has also been shown to be susceptible to ACE2-containing influenza strains, causing dark matter problems in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that the age of the patient is highly correlated and can have serious consequences.
Special laboratory conclusions: The level of red blood cell protein (CRP) in the blood indicates the severity of tumor or lymphoma and has been shown to be one of the factors that may contribute to the treatment of disease, the response to treatment and the recovery of the patient.
The relationship between CRP and COVID-19 prevalence and prevalence has also been identified.
Furthermore, high levels of LDH, AST, ALT, and CK can also be a predictor of the outcome of a disease.
These discs are highly expressed in various tissues, especially the heart and the dark, and are released when the body's organs are damaged.
Therefore, they are usually indicative of heart problems or dark circles.
Key Symptoms: Breast implants and short-term symptoms should be addressed as well as other issues in the planning of treatment for COVID-19 issues.
Use of anti-inflammatory drugs: As mentioned above, anti-inflammatory drugs are anti-inflammatory drugs that are widely used as complementary therapies for infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of the immune response.
Because the high levels of corticosteroids taken by the patient were widely used in patients with SARS, many patients who recovered from osteoarthritis were associated with permanent disability and poor health.
Therefore, if necessary, COVID-19 patients should take a low dose of anti-inflammatory medication and in a short time.
Mental fatigue: As mentioned above, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many patients experienced extreme fatigue due to prolonged isolation and extreme depression and the loss of their loved ones who were ill.
It is essential to provide these patients with psychological counseling and long-term support to help them recover from excess fatigue and return to normal life.
According to the patient studies conducted so far, COVID-19 appears to have distinct characteristics from SARS.
In addition to the respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 may progress successfully through the gastrointestinal tract and the nasal tract and may or may not cause mild symptoms in the early days of infection, as with other common influenza viruses.
Therefore, infected patients in the first days or as the symptoms progress may have a higher number of viruses performing normal functions, thus increasing the resistance to the disease.
However, SARS-CoV infection has been shown to occur in patients who are ill, as most cases are unclean in the first days.
This is why the COVID-19 pandemic is more severe and more resistant than the SARS pandemic.
There are currently several measures in China to include a lockdown in Wuhan and surrounding cities and a continued quarantine of almost all residents to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have severely impacted the economy and other sectors of the country's economy, the number of new cases is declining, indicating that the epidemic is receding.
A very interesting prediction is that the pandemic will end in March, and the recovery period will last between 3 and 4 months.
But some experts disagree.
Paul Hunter and colleagues have found that COVID-19, which is more contagious than SARS, will not end by 2020.
Ira Longini and colleagues have developed a global pandemic outcome plan and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian team reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in chest and throat tests of patients who had recovered 2 weeks after discharge from the hospital, suggesting that the new virus may recur as a normal influenza virus.
But there are some promising signs in China based on the declining number of new cases, suggesting that the measures taken may be effective.
Initially, it was estimated that one million people would be infected with Ebola and 500,000 would die.
But due to strict quarantine measures, the disease has been defeated.
Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 infections are likely to be reduced and then disappear or become a less lethal virus among people who carry it.
The comparison of the COVID-19 outbreak with SARS and MERS is shown below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious through coughing or sweating, and can also be transmitted through contact with the virus's pathogens.
The virus has also been found in the urine, which means that there may be a new way to spread the virus to the mouth of a person who touches the urine.
A recent study of 138 patients showed that 41% of patients were likely to be infected by a hospital infection, including 17 patients who had previously been infected with 40 medical conditions.
Therefore, greater discretion is needed to protect people, especially doctors, nurses, siblings of the sick, colleagues, and even travelers who may come into contact with sick or infected people.
The first precautionary measure that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is to wear masks; the use of medical masks and N95 masks (class # 1860s) helps to prevent the spread of the virus.
Medical masks help prevent droplets from a person who may be infected from moving through the air or touching objects and then passing on to others.
But only N95 masks (class # 1860s) can protect against the ingestion of airborne viruses of 10 to 80 nm, 5% of which are viral; SARS-CoV-2 is the same size as SARS-CoV and both are about 85 nm.
Because there are areas that can be accessed by five medical masks in a row, doctors who frequently consult patients must wear N95 masks (Class # 1860s) instead of medical masks.
In addition to wearing masks, doctors should wear clothes that are designed to reduce the risk of infection.
Viruses can infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor contracted SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing a N95 mask; this means that the virus has passed through his face.
Doctors must therefore also wear facial protectors or special contact lenses when they are caring for patients.
For people in general living in areas affected or at risk of infection, it is essential that everyone washes their hands frequently with medicated soap, tries to quarantine themselves and stays at home and avoids contact with potentially infected people.
I have a meter and a half distance between me and the patient.
These actions are an effective way to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 entered humans as a novel virus, its many similarities to SARS-CoV as reported on 7 January 2020 must have caused China to become more skeptical of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, on January 19, 2020, the Director of the Wuhan Institute of Disease Control reassured the public that the new virus is highly contagious and that people are not highly contagious and that the fight against and eradication of the disease is not a problem.
The message greatly diminished public awareness, especially as the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the chances of preventing the outbreak in Wuhan were thus lost.
The Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can learn from this important lesson and make significant changes in the future.
For example, these agencies must (1) be proficient in delivering public announcements because citizens take every word into account and then change their behavior and decisions; (2) be more attentive to the special information provided by hospitals and make appropriate decisions rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or authorities; (3) take more measures to prevent any outbreak from starting rather than trying to comfort the public; and (4) organize multi-stage, dedicated training sessions to help the public better understand epidemics and try and improve response measures in different situations.
The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus started in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it had spread throughout China and to some 50 other countries worldwide at the time of this report.
Because the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has led to a resurgence of SARS.
But there are obvious differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are important in preventing the outbreak and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and affects men more than women, and the mortality rate is also higher among adults than among young people.
SARS is more commonly fatal than COVID-19 (10.91% to 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients spread the virus even when no symptoms are present and SARS patients are more likely to infect others during illness, making the prevention of COVID-19 more effective than SARS.
This is one of the reasons why SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
An approved RNA test for SARS-CoV-2 may not be infectious in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who recover may be exposed to the virus again.
All of this greatly increases the risk of spreading the virus.
Despite this step in the wake of the COVID-19 research, several key questions remain to be answered:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although there is a 96% consensus between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like influenza-like CoVs, we cannot confirm that SARS-CoV-2 is influenza-associated.
Which animal first infected a virus from an animal virus, say smallpox, and then infected humans?
Without knowing the answers to questions 1 and 2, we cannot effectively stop the spread of the virus, and the pandemic may recur at any time.
Although molecular and tissue studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is an ACE2 pathogen, how does the virus enter the respiratory system and cause subsequent disease mutations?
Does the virus bind to ACE2 producing cells in other tissues?
Until we have clear answers to these questions, we cannot quickly and effectively diagnose the virus and treat it adequately.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the nature of this virus change as it spreads to humans?
Will it be a global pandemic, will it become a SARS-like outbreak, or will it recur as a flu pandemic?
Finding answers to these and many other questions is important but can take time.
But whatever it takes, we have no choice but to stop the pandemic as soon as possible and return people to normalcy.
Animals infected with human coronavirus
The evolution and adaptation of coronavirus (CoVs) has led to evolving human or animal viruses over thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, two human-borne CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause a mild illness, such as the common cold.
The SARS outbreak and the Middle East influenza outbreak (MERS) have changed the way HCoVs can be life-threatening and potentially serious.
The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in central China in late 2019 has brought back the media attention of CoVs and has surprised us with its highly contagious but low infectious potential compared to its SARS-CoV counterpart.
HCoVs are an animal-borne disease and therefore identifying the animal origin of HCoVs can be helpful to us as well.
Most HCoVs are parasitic and are not pathogenic.
Pre-infected animals of some HCoVs are also unknown.
Knowing the animals around them has a direct impact on preventing human infections.
Research into interactions between CoVs in animals can also be useful in identifying the way that CoVs cause disease in humans.
In this review, we provide a summary of the current knowledge about seven HCoVs, focusing on the history of animal origins and how they spread across different species.
Importantly, we compare different HCoVs by focusing on how the virus changes and how the genome develops.
The current COVID-19 outbreak is being studied in this area.
Furthermore, the requirements for the transmission of viruses by the viral mutation on the severity of the disease are also specified.
Coronavirus (CoVs) are members of the family Coronaviridae, which is a group of highly conserved and highly conserved RNA viruses.
These viruses contain large genomes of 26 to 32 kcal in RNA viruses called CoVs because they are similar to a kimba in an electronic microscope.
In terms of structure, CoVs have a genome that is not divided into similar structures.
About two-thirds of the genome is made up of two large, seamlessly connected cells (ORF1a and ORF1b), which form the proteins pp1a and pp1ab with different functions.
Different functional proteins are then rearranged to form 16 homologous proteins, called nsp1~16.
The remainder of the genome consists of single-stranded protein ORFs, including the head (S), the tail (E), the nucleus (M) and the nucleoproteins (N).
Multiple family-related proteins are also produced by different families of CoVs.
Based on the protein structure differences, CoVs are divided into four subtypes (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delita-CoV), with the beta-CoV being the most abundant HCoV and divided into four subtypes (A, B, C and D).
Early evidence has shown that mosquitoes and mosquitoes are the primary source of most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the primary source of gamma-CoVs and delita-CoVs.
Over thousands of years, CoVs have been commonly infected with a variety of viruses, some of which have been shown to be highly pathogenic.
Currently, there are seven known human-infected CoVs (HCoVs).
These include HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 which are classified as alpha-CoVs.
The five other beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, the highly contagious influenza virus (SARS-CoV), the Middle East influenza virus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 often cause mild symptoms, such as common cold or diarrhea.
On the other hand, the recently identified SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic viruses, causing severe respiratory tract infections in many patients at high risk of severe respiratory distress (ARDS) and exoplanetary distress.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was found in the nasal cavities of patients with chronic influenza in the mid-1960s.
Since then, there has been a growing awareness from extensive research on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause infectious symptoms.
Yes, many people had agreed that HCoVs were normally harmless until the SARS outbreak.
The 2003 SARS outbreak was one of the most severe outbreaks in recent history, claiming 8,000 lives, accounting for about 10% of all deaths.
Ten years later, the Middle East influenza outbreak (MERS) has resulted in a frequent epidemic in the Arab world that has occasionally spread to other parts of the world.
The new 2019 HCoV (2019-nCoV), later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the primary cause of the current coronavirus outbreak 2019 (COVID-19) that, as of March 2, 2020, had killed 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000.
It has been a long time since the world was warned to prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
All seven HCoVs are derived from rodents, mice or pets.
There is evidence that HCoVs are an influenza virus, which is usually associated with non-pathogenic viruses but has a different genetic structure.
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused serious health, knowledge, social and behavioral problems in China and around the world.
Identifying the origins of HCoVs provides a way to understand the natural history, causes and barriers to species evolution.
This may also facilitate or facilitate the search for an animal that is infected with SARS-CoV-2, the first infection that caused its spread, which could have a significant impact on preventing its future spread.
In this study, we provide a summary of the animal origins, transmission between different species and disease-causing mechanisms of HCoVs.
In particular, we point to and examine the common argument that HCoVs-generating viruses do not usually cause disease in animals but cause disease in humans or new animals after spreading to different species.
We also study the evolution of HCoVs where the prevalence is often associated with decreased infectious capacity.
In this section we also examine the current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
CoVs have been known to infect animals since the late 1930s.
Prior to the first detection of the strain of HCoV-229E, B814, in the nasal cavities of patients with chronic influenza, various CoVs were identified from various infected animals, including bats, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
In the last decade, seven HCoVs have been identified.
The historical summary of how HCoVs have been discovered (Table 1) provides information and human reactions.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was found in the respiratory tract of patients with respiratory diseases of the throat and nose in 1966, and later developed in the WI-38 lung cells.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E exhibited normal influenza symptoms, such as headache, sweating, nausea and sore throat, and fever and cough, which were found in 10~20% of patients.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was detected in a tissue and later appeared in the brains of rodents.
The clinical signs of HCoV-OC43 are similar to those of HCoV-229E, and cannot be distinguished from infections caused by other respiratory viruses such as avian influenza viruses and common influenza viruses.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are both globally occurring, and are most commonly distributed in the spring and early summer.
The time it takes for both viruses to show symptoms is generally less than a week, followed by a course of approximately 2 weeks.
According to a study of voluntary subjects, non-infected individuals with HCoV-229E were affected by chronic influenza.
A small number of patients with chronic metabolic problems had severe respiratory problems.
SARS, also known as special strain, was the first extensively studied HCoV outbreak in human history to be caused by SARS-CoV, the third HCoV to be discovered.
SARS was first reported in late 2002 in China's Guangdong Province.
SARS outbreak has infected 8,096 confirmed cases and resulted in 774 deaths, spreading to many countries and continents.
In addition to the most severe infections, it has been shown that each patient could be infected as well as two others, taking between 4 and 7 days for symptoms to manifest and then the virus becomes more severe by the 10th day of infection.
SARS-CoV infected patients initially experienced joint pain, headache, fever, nausea and vomiting, followed by difficulty breathing, diarrhea and severe breathing problems as symptoms later emerged.
The reduction in stem cell, poorly functioning dark screenings and high creatinine levels are the main problems SARS is exposing in the laboratory.
Severe respiratory impairment (DAD), proliferation of epithelial cells and increased immune response are also seen in SARS patients.
About 20-30% of patients require emergency room treatment and ventilation.
In addition to respiratory tract infections, various organs such as the liver, kidney and liver can also be affected in these patients, often with increased levels of cytokines, which can lead to death, especially in patients with chronic kidney problems.
The virus was first detected in the lung area of a patient who was first exposed to the virus who had traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, a number of developments have been made in the field of HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was detected in a 7-month-old Dutch baby in late 2004.
It was first found in children, adults, and patients with chronic inflammatory diseases and respiratory diseases.
Nose irritation, redness of the eyes, eye inflammation and boron cholera are the most common causes of HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study revealed the virus in a nasal test taken on an 8-month-old boy with epilepsy in the Netherlands.
Although it originated in the Netherlands, it is actually found worldwide.
HCoV-NL63 is estimated to cause about 4,7% of all respiratory tract infections and is most prevalent in early summer, winter and spring.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with a narrowing of the throat and nose.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was detected in a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized with pneumonia and boronchioritis in Hong Kong.
In addition to the presence of local disease, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to increase the risk of asthma in patients with asthma.
As with HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been identified worldwide as a cause of mild respiratory illness.
All four HCoVs are highly adaptable to humans and are generally unlikely to cause highly contagious viral infections, although there have been incidents of unknown causes as a rare example of the highly contagious HCoV-NL63 strain, which has recently been reported to cause severe respiratory infections in China.
In general, when these HCoVs have the ability to spread widely and remain in humans, they have a low incidence or a low incidence of disease.
MERS-CoV was first detected in the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute renal failure in Saudi Arabia in 2012.
While many patients were identified by laboratory tests from the Middle East, occasional infections from other countries were identified in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another mild outbreak in South Korea in 2015 had 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical symptoms of MERS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by a sharp swelling.
In addition to SARS, MERS patients also have severe renal impairment, making it the most common MERS among HCoV-related diseases.
Over 30% of patients experience symptoms of occupational diseases such as dizziness and dizziness.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory tests have confirmed cases with a mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most lethal viruses known to date.
From mid-2019 to late December, cases of measles that were previously known to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infection as a public health emergency of concern to the world, which has named the outbreak COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases had been confirmed worldwide, with a mortality rate of 3.4%.
In this category, the mortality rate in Hubei, China is 4.2%, and outside this province is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes acute influenza such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which is accompanied by fever, diarrhea and shortness of breath.
Some patients suffer from epilepsy.
Constipation is one of the most severe symptoms and the patient may soon become ill and develop severe breathing problems.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar in many ways due to the 82% similarity of nucleotide structure, they have different branches on the stem.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be a rare but widespread pathogen compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 infections have been reported with no symptoms and may be contributing to the rapid spread of the virus worldwide.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 and six other HCoVs indicates similarities and differences that should be considered.
First, the time it takes for symptoms to manifest and the duration of HCoV infection are closely related.
In this category, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general family of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and the four HCoVs that infect a species by location (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by symptoms that are most common in HCoVs that infect species depending on their location, such as mild, specific symptoms or not.
Also, a very small number of COVID-19 cases can also be detected during SARS-CoV infection, although the incidence is slightly lower.
Third, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 also indicates the appropriate patterns of HCoVs that are susceptible to SARS-CoV.
On the other hand, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of HCoVs that infect species depending on their location.
On the other hand, it is still necessary to monitor whether the spread of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after human transmission as in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Lastly, as with other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected through cross-sectional testing.
Future studies should determine whether the spread of SARS-CoV-2 through saliva and oral fluid is as influential as SARS-CoV at least in some areas.
It is also important to consider in particular whether SARS-CoV-2 can be as diverse as HCoVs that infect species depending on their location.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 including the spread pattern, the ability to transmit disease and the long-term post-human spread will contribute to the end of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
HCoVs are characterized by a range of symptoms that are mild and have been able to adapt to humans.
On the other hand, it is also possible that it is actually humans who have been able to adapt to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both may have survived previous HCoV outbreaks.
HCoVs cause severe human infections and people who are infected with severe HCoVs have died.
To achieve this, human-infected coronaviruses (HCoVs) produce enough cells to allow them to detect changes in the body's antigenic proteins that inhibit the virus's growth.
Thus, as the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak continues to spread, there is a higher risk that it will become more familiar to the human body.
If properly adapted, the transmission to humans will be more difficult to prevent by means of a cutoff or other measures.
For many years, four types of out-of-hospital viruses of CoV have been transmitted to humans, causing infection in people with normal immunodeficiency.
The viruses do not need to be present in animals.
On the other hand, the most pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses have not been well adapted to human body, which means that human transmission is short-lived.
They need to continue to grow in viral animals that are waiting to be transmitted to humans with low immunity through one or more of their own highly transmitted animals.
SARS-CoV-2 has a similar structure to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four out-of-hospital HCoV viruses.
It is very similar to the out-of-hospital transmission of HCoV viruses, which is rare to date.
However, it is more pathogenic than the out-of-hospital HCoV virus and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will adapt to humans and walk among humans without an animal leaving.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoV, it is important to discuss the definitions and characteristics of animals in which HCoVs mutate, naturally live, multiply, grow and are highly transmitted.
The animal is responsible for the growth of HCoVs when closely related to their source and they have many genetic similarities.
An animal-borne virus is usually familiar and does not cause disease in the animal.
The animals were thus domesticated and remained susceptible to HCoV viruses for a long time.
For both reasons, animals infected with the virus are genetically infected with the HCoV or the virus that gives birth to it.
On the other hand, when HCoVs appear new in a growing animal shortly or near human transmission, they are not well-defined and often cause disease.
The growing animal may be the most susceptible animal to human infection and the most susceptible animal to the rapid spread of the virus and to human infection by increasing the human infection rate.
The HCoV virus is not contagious unless it is mutated in a growing animal.
On the other hand, HCoVs can adapt to the animal in which they grow and remain in it for a long time.
In this case, the animal that grows becomes a naturally-bred animal.
The epidemiological data showed that the first case of SARS was transmitted during game hunting.
Subsequent blood tests showed that animal traffickers were more sensitive to the body's resistance to SARS-CoV IgG than to the general population.
The first animal-controlled vaccines were tested for SARS-CoV-like viruses that are very similar to SARS-CoV.
This is directly confirmed by the fact that SARS was still reported after killing all the ticks in the markets.
However, it has been reported that wild or bee-infested bats have not met with wild animals from which SARS-CoV has been tested, meaning that bats may also be an animal that SARS-CoV grows and spreads highly but cannot naturally live with them.
In particular, while 80% of the animal species in Guangzhou markets have anti-SARS-CoV resistance, there is no denying that many species of small mammals SARS-CoV can be highly susceptible to and propagated.
All of these are not likely to infect SARS-CoV.
Subsequent animal studies of the pre-growth SARS-CoV virus have shown that the most commonly identified influenza CoV, known as SARS-CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), is found in Chinese influenza.
The virus has antibodies to SARS-CoV and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome.
These and other influenza CoVs share 88-92% of the SARS-CoV sequence.
The study confirmed the new idea that smallpox contains an immature virus that causes human disease.
Most SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have been detected in influenza, but none other than WIV1 is considered a pathogenic virus.
The human enzyme-converting angiotensin (ACE2) receptor is known to be a SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 is derived from a rapidly growing serum that uses ACE2 in the liver, liver and humans to enter the body.
Ironically, the serum of patients receiving SARS was able to inhibit the WIV1 virus.
WIV1 is currently the most common strain of the influenza SARS-CoV, with a 95% prevalence in the genome alone.
Although the two viruses are closely related, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the source of the SARS-CoV virus and that the germs are not the source of the SARS-CoV virus.
The viral mutation analysis classifies MERS-CoV into a single group of viruses of the influenza viruses CoV-HKU4 and CoV-HKU5.
The influenza co-VHKU4 and MERS-CoV are receptors for the same DPP4 protein, which is used by viruses to enter the body.
The RNA polymerase structure protein in MERS-CoV is very similar to the main beta-CoV virus that has been found in Europe and Africa.
Currently, there is no live MERS-CoV virus found in wild cockroaches.
MERS-CoV and other highly similar viruses of the CoV-HKU25 strain are only 87% consistent in the study.
Therefore, the germs may not be the source of the MERS-CoV virus.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that camels have a particularly vulnerable host for the MERS-CoV virus, as do camels from the Middle East in many African countries.
The live MERS-CoV virus is similar to a human virus derived from camel nostrils, further proving that camels are the true target of MERS-CoV.
It should also be noted that these are generally mild but suggestive signs that the virus has grown and evolved from a large number of camels tested for MERS-CoV infection.
In particular, infected camels released the virus not only through the respiratory tract but also through the urethra, which is the main route through which the virus is transmitted from mosquitoes.
However, questions arise as most confirmed MERS infections do not occur in camels prior to the onset of symptoms, which may be considered human infections or unknown transmission and may be that unknown animal species have MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 has a 96.2% sequence and a CoTG13 strain of the virus derived from the strain.
In the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses, the differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are so large that they cannot be considered to be of the same origin.
Flu may not be the virus of SARS-CoV-2 unless a similar flu-like CoV is detected in the near future.
It is likely that SARS-CoV-2-infected animals are in the wild and sold at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where most of the first COVID-19 infections originated, indicating the possibility of animal transmission to humans.
A number of recent studies based on metagenome structure have suggested that a group of vulnerable microorganisms known as the spores may also be a strain of the SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV virus.
These newly isolated CoV genomes have an 85-92% response rate to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
However, they are related to RaTG13 at about 90% molecular level.
They belong to two subgroups of viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 in viral mutations, one of which has a SARS-CoV-2-like receptor-binding protein (RBD) at 97.4% amino acid sequence.
In contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are very different, although they are highly similar in terms of genomic connectivity.
Previous studies on infectious diseases have also revealed that small viral fragments have been identified in the pulmonary tract, which are similar to SARS-CoV-2.
The study used a variety of combinations and selections to produce a single genome structure that makes up 86.3% of the total viral genome.
We also mention the possibility that the spider is a strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
However, there is currently no evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is a direct strain of the virus as the strain between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 in relation to beta-CoV infects the virus.
And, the interval between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is the shortest between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 in relation to the viral beta-CoV.
The pathway of SARS-CoV-2 mutation in mosquitoes, fungi and other animals needs to be clarified.
While the strong interaction patterns were identified in RBD between SARS-CoV-2 and the virus, SARS-CoV-2 in association with beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 shared the strong genome patterns.
It is widely believed that only the high RBD between SARS-CoV-2 viral strain-infecting beta-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is caused by selective changes.
Another project is to switch the gene from SARS-CoV-2 to beta-CoV-acquired viral infection and RaTG13 to a third wildlife species.
In the case of mutations, mutations in the genes are most common in beta-CoVs.
The Council is still studying animals that are infected with SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to the highly pathogenic HCoVs, the animal derivatives of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Evidence of viral mutations suggested that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from the influenza virus, while viruses that give rise to HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were found in mosquitoes.
It has been reported that the ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Mountain CoV) strain of the virus was identified in a three-colored strain of the virus that in North America showed close association with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was a gene-related strain of the influenza virus, known as Hipposideros/GhanaAugust/19/2008, identified in Ghana, where a camel strain was suspected to carry the virus.
To clarify, the knowledge available on animals known to have carried the HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Analysis of viral mutations has indicated that there has been historical interspecies transmission of HCoV.
When HCoV-OC43 was removed from some strains of human-caused domestic animals around 1890, an outbreak of respiratory infection occurred.
The history of inter-species transmission of HCoV-229E is unclear.
The alpha-CoV of the HCoV-229E-like strain has been identified.
Among them is the alpha-CoV receptor.
There is a growing body of evidence to support the fact that viral infection is transmitted from mosquitoes to humans.
First, non-native people gathered in large numbers in the same place.
However, people are the most likely to experience the effects of arthritis.
Second, HCoV-229E is associated with the influenza alpha-CoV and is neither contagious nor infectious to the influenza, whereas the influenza alpha-CoV is caused by respiratory infection in animals.
The alpha-CoV from the arupaga was then found in the wild.
Therefore, there is no doubt that the strains of HCoV-229E are related to alpha-CoV and to humans.
In short, germs are the main sources of infection for people with the influenza virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that smallpox can be contagious to humans with HCoV-229E.
In contrast, where alpha-CoVs are a group of HCoV-229E genes, the strains of camels that may be viruses that transmit viruses to humans are similar to those of the MERS-CoV virus.
MERS-CoV is a good example of cross-breeding from mosquito to camel to camel to human.
The origin of the MERS-CoV mutation in the influenza virus is known when it was first identified and confirmed by subsequent studies.
It is clear that mosquitoes are a large group of animal viruses in the transmission of genetic and inter-animal infections.
Longevity, habitat, proximity and high flight ability are what make bugs a powerful 'viral-spreading' animal.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV virus entered camels many years ago.
He was familiar with camels who had moved from being pets to being safe and natural host animals.
MERS-CoV is a mild and progressive disease-causing virus in these animals.
Human transmission is catastrophic and humans do not transmit MERS-CoV as its spread is limited.
In addition to the role of the camel in MERS-CoV infection, the role of the fungus, if any, in the SARS-CoV-2 infection varies.
In particular, the beta-CoV of the pancreas is a major pathogen in the pancreas.
They may contain the SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoV-related virus but do not infect it as well as the SARS-CoV virus.
It is highly likely that animal-borne SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans will be confirmed or not confirmed in future studies.
First, the viruses may be a viral strain related to SARS-CoV-2 that is related to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
People can share a common habitat through mining and quarrying.
Second, mosquitoes may be among the most rapidly infected viral animals with SARS-CoV-2-related viruses.
People transmit viruses through surgery and eating wild animal meat.
Most mammals, including domestic animals, are likely to be suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Studies in pets and wildlife have found that they have anti-virus agents.
Third, the data on the mutation and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have been from a third strain of animals exposed to the virus and camel.
The search for an animal that causes SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
In addition to the different strains of viral organisms, three viral factors are also important in facilitating the transmission of CoV to other animal species.
First, it is a rate of change of magnitude in the synthesis of RNA.
Compared to other viruses of the same RNA gene, the variation in the P or P is approximately ~10-4 per year for each 2 genes, depending on the stage of the CoV mutation in the newly infected animal.
CoV has an enzyme that converts RNA, which blocks its components, causing it to become highly modified and deactivated.
Remdesivir is known to inhibit the synthesis of CoV cells by an enzyme that inhibits the RNA polymerase protein synthesis.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising medicines for SARS-CoV-2 that has been clinically tested.
However, the variation of CoV is nearly a million times higher than the animals from which the virus grows.
And the variation is usually higher when the CoV is not well adapted to the animals that grow on it.
In comparison to highly variable SARS-CoV, the underlying mutations of SARS-CoV-2 are evident, making it more familiar to humans.
It is said that he was already familiar with other animals, most closely related to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to live in camels.
Therefore, it is unlikely that gene mutations will cause the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and vaccine to be rapidly depleted.
Second, the large RNA genome in CoVs uses a different genome-transformation and genetic modification mechanism; thus, it increases the chance of mutation from the host animal, which is beneficial for the development of new CoV viruses when appropriate.
This is supported by the structure of the RNA that makes up the protein and its complex function of the 3rd genome.
Third, the CoV is transformed and often transformed into other RNA molecules through the process of genome modification.
In a host animal, genome changes occur frequently as the CoV RNA reaches the nucleus.
RNAs are very similar and have complementary genomes that can modify the nucleus to produce new CoVs.
Natural viral mutations have been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal-borne CoVs such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9 that live in mosquitoes.
The interaction of viruses with animals in the infection
In addition to the three viruses mentioned above, viral interactions with the animal in which it grows are another factor in the transmission of infection between different species.
Thus, the SARS-CoV mutation is considered a valid example, and has shown a good selection of the body part of the virus that is transmitted between animals.
Based on a comparative analysis of SARS-COV infection in humans and the lungs, it is thought that SARS-CoV adapts rapidly to the various host bodies, specifically the RBD mutation of the S protein.
In general, the S-protein RBD of the CoV virus has a receptor-specific and selective receptor that is activated by the immune system.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is 318 to 510 in the S1 class of amino acids, which makes it binding to human ACE2 and is the base for the virus's entry into the body.
SARS-CoV RBD can detect ACE2 receptors in a variety of animal viruses, including mosquitoes, ticks, mice, tick species, which cause animal viral infection.
In summary, only 6 amino acid residues were studied in contrast to those of human and mouse viruses in RBD and 4 of them had a viral ACE2 receptor.
Liver SARS-CoV with mutations K479N and S487T in its RBD may increase binding to the S protein and human receptor ACE2.
In other words, converting these two amino acids may be essential for the human body's adaptation of the virus.
It is interesting to note that SARS-CoV-2 is hosted by the same gene as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 segment of the S protein indicates a link between the S-related ACE2 protein in humans that may have been modified.
In fact, cryo-EM studies show a 10 - 20 degree correlation of the human ACE2 binding to the S protein of SARS-CoV.
It is also interesting to confirm whether there is another viral receptor used to infect SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but on a different part of the S protein.
Other HCoV receptor genes, such as the N-aminopeptide of HCoV-229E, and sialic acid with the 9-O acetyl of HCoV-OC43, are also present.
It may explain how the CoV virus acclimates to human body contamination from animals from which it was developed.
In addition to the viral receptor, the presence of HCoV-infected animals is also influenced by the growth site and the anti-viral protein.
The differences in the protein where the virus grows between humans and animals have made HCoVs such as worms, camels and mice susceptible to viral transmission between different species.
HCoVs modify local genes and break down viral antibodies to infect other animals.
The molecular components in this complex viral-to-focused relationship should therefore continue to be identified and explained.
A genome-defective test of the viral growth site and the SARS-CoV-2 antigen protein using the latest CRISPR technology may be effective.
The emergence of the new HCoV virus: its origin
Most influenza variants of the CoV offer a high probability of emergence of the new HCoV virus.
Thus, the influenza virus is the source of the HCoV gene.
And rapid mutation and gene mutation are two important steps in the process for HCoV mutation.
For example: Getting or losing genes that make proteins have the potential to significantly alter a virus segment.
In SARS-CoV gene expression, ORF8 is thought to be essential for human anatomy, and SARS-CoV-related influenza viruses have been isolated to produce different ORF8 proteins.
The 29th SARS-CoV virus was detected in the genome at the beginning of the human pandemic.
This protein reduces ORF8 to ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be susceptible to mutations in animals.
And SARS-CoV is known to modify the genes of the alpha and gamma-CoV strains of viruses, where a large number of modified genes have been transferred to RNA polymerase proteins.
A modified keyword has been found in nsp9, most in nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
In some ways, MERS-CoV has been implicated in a mutation in two different strains of the virus in Saudi camels.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, gene mutations have also been observed in other HCoVs, where HCoVs mutate the CoV genes of other animals into their own specific genes.
It should be noted that unnatural selection may contribute to unintended changes in the virus genome, leading to the virus emerging from the selected region, such as the immune system of the animal in which the virus is located.
An example of this function is the absence of the normal ORF4 gene in HCoV-229E, which causes double-stranded DNA to be removed.
While a strong ORF4 was found in the fungal and lama viruses associated with HCoV-229E, the alpha-CoV in the arupaga showed a single-mode pathogenesis, resulting in mutations.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs is also due to the problems of longevity in the animals.
The absence of only minor symptoms or symptoms identified when the virus is infected with CoV, and the co-existence between CoV and uducurama.
It is clear that the bacteria are well adapted to the CoV in terms of their physiological structure.
For example: Inefficiencies in the immune molecules in the flu effectively reduce infections caused by the CoV virus.
And the naturally occurring viral antibodies in the mouse have been stopped due to the addition of NKG2/CD94 receptor genes and the low visibility of the molecule that regulates type I tissue bindings.
And high levels of oxygenated nutrients (ROS) from multiple reactions of the immune system can inhibit the CoV from dissociating and affect the regulation of gene-modifying enzymes, thus selecting the most pathogenic viral genes when passed to new animals.
Other genes that cause CoV disease also change, producing new proteins or parts of them that make the animal more familiar with the virus.
Thus, it is unlikely that three new HCoVs have emerged in the past two decades.
CoVs do not cause disease or minor symptoms in animals with a high incidence of ticks and ticks.
They are transformed by the strong resistance of the body's immune system.
This is the key to why animals with the virus show no symptoms and why people become more susceptible.
The symptoms are mainly due to excessive immune activity and high levels of cytokines, and the more resistant the immune system is, the more damaged the lungs are.
It is different from the non-symptomatic animals, where the immune system from the CoV virus is changing.
Immune isolation may be useful in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 virus.
The protein is a strong anti-viral agent in the spleen.
Thus, the provision of anti-virus type I proteins without the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 could be beneficial.
The anti-viral protein NLRP3 is also inactive in the pancreas.
According to these suggestions, inhibiting the activity of NLRP3 protein with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses.
While it has been shown that the beta-CoV of the fungus has a 95% affinity for SARS-CoV, it also has a 96% affinity for SARS-CoV-2.
While liver and other wildlife have been found to contain viruses similar to SARS-CoV, no SARS-CoV-2 virus has been found to grow from them.
A bacterial beta-CoV very similar to SARS-CoV-2 has been identified, suggesting that the virus may be a growth animal or a bacterial beta-CoV that is part of the gene that binds to SARS-CoV-2.
Although there are some questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately or accidentally produced by humans.
CoVs have been reported in response to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Research into the CoV in mosquitoes and other animals has significantly changed our perception of HCoVs in animals as human infections.
There are strong indications that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are parasitic and are transmitted to humans through their growth medium.
The fact that SARS-CoV infection is caused by the proximity of humans and mice to animal markets, closure and killing of the mice in them would effectively prevent the SARS outbreak.
Similarly, insecticides should be removed from animal markets to prevent infection of other animals, according to research on the beta-CoV origin of closely related SARS-CoV-2 insecticides.
However, the human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from insects and other mammals is yet to be fully understood in future studies.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has been present in camels for a long time.
Camels are important animals in transporting and distributing meat, milk, fur, and wool for clothing to the inhabitants of their communities.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, you cannot sacrifice all camels to fight the MERS virus, as has been done in animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent recurrence of MERS, serious and additional disease control measures must be taken with the MERS-CoV vaccine.
If we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may appear and cause epidemics.
Various CoVs infect wildlife.
In particular, the CoVs of the spleen have different capabilities.
In the future, it is highly likely that the animal-borne variant of CoV will evolve, resulting in a new highly contagious or lethal variant of CoV.
The practice of eating wild animals in some parts of China must be eliminated by avoiding unnecessary human-animal contact.
In view of the ongoing challenges posed by SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a clear anti-virus response plan is needed.
In short, there have been many viruses around the world for a long time.
They remain in the wild until they have a chance to escape.
Although viruses have many forms of transmission, the risk of human exposure to viruses and other wildlife species can be reduced if humans are trained to avoid them.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is essential for a better understanding of the environment of the CoV and its host animals, which is useful in preventing animal infection in humans and preventing future infections.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent animal viruses is to understand the complexity of the viruses and the animals that grow from them.
There are still many animal strains of SARS-CoV-2 that have not been identified.
First, if the bacteria infect the parasites of the virus that caused SARS-CoV-2, it is interesting to see why the parasites and parasites live in the same habitat.
Second, if microbes directly infect humans with viruses, the human exposure to microbes should be determined.
Third, if the third mammals actually function as a mature animal, how do they interact with different species of animals, such as humans, rodents and insects, must be understood.
Then, if many mammals are domestically raised animals that may be infected with SARS-CoV-2, surveillance and disease control should be carried out.
Whether it is a mosquito, mosquito or other mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or its highly transmitted viruses are expected to be present in future growths in animals.
Further animal studies will explain the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will play a major role in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
The revision of the COVID-19 assessment criteria  Suspected illness and confirmed illness is essential
On February 6, 2020, our team published a timely guideline that includes recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, and the guidelines provided us with experience and provide a better understanding of how to combat the pandemic globally.
However, the 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) is a relatively new disease, and our understanding and understanding of it is gradually increasing based on ongoing research and clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment procedures are also continually being updated.
In this letter, we responded to one suggestion on our policy line and provide new standards for the assessment of suspected illness and  confirmed cases in accordance with the latest COVID-19 (Class VII) diagnosis and treatment guidelines published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus of 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, now officially known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was designated as severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed urgent guidelines and published them online in the Military Medical Survey on 06 February 2020.
Since its release, it has attracted a lot of attention.
But it is important to recognize that COVID-19 is a new disease, and our perceptions and knowledge are gradually growing based on ongoing research and clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment procedures are also continually being updated.
For example, the COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, published seven volumes including some significantly revised articles.
Our line of thought has now embraced the idea of Zhou and others, who have developed a simple method of grading based on their medical experience.
Their work has added new tangible evidence to our line of action and has provided useful insights into this global pandemic.
We support and appreciate their hard work.
However, their performance must also be updated in accordance with the latest guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 (Step Seven Testing) and recent research.
As indicated in Book Seven (3 March 2020), the confirmation of suspected cases must be linked to one of two epidemiological criteria for a comprehensive diagnosis, or must meet three epidemiological criteria if the epidemiological criteria are unclear:
History of the outbreak: (1) There has been a travel or residence in Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other COVID-19 cases reported in the past 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) There has been an encounter with SARS-CoV-2 infections (with evidence of nucleic acid); (3) There has been an encounter with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and surrounding areas, or else there have been COVID-19 cases reported in the past 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) There has been an encounter with local patients (more than 2 patients with fever or respiratory symptoms reported in a period of 2 weeks, such as in a hospital, home, office, school, and other places).
Symptoms of disease: (1) fever or symptoms of poor breathing; (2) with symptoms of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count that shows normal levels, not increasing or decreasing in the baseline.
The diagnosis of the confirmed patient must be based on a suspected disease that shows one of the following pathogenic or blood-based symptoms: (1) a real-time PCR sample that detected SARS-CoV-2 infection; (2) a sequence of key viral pathogens that showed a link to a known novel coronavirus; (3) a detection of specific IgM and IgG genes for SARS-CoV-2 in serum testing; or a mutation of specific IgG genes for SARS-CoV-2 from the uninfected to the bar, or a 4-fold increase in the same area during the recovery phase during a severe infection.
We note that the respiratory nucleic acid or blood samples taken when added to the second volume (18 January 2020) and third volume (22 January 2020).
Diagnosis in blood samples is included in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; then blood-based evidence is added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on ongoing research efforts to find a better way to identify visible nucleic acid for rapid diagnosis, and on respiratory samples including blood samples, which provide a variety of samples and support the identification of specific infectious cells in approved procedures.
In addition, there are many signs that remind us to be cautious of patients who have and do not have symptoms.
Therefore, Zhou's and others' chart needs to be revised, as they classify a person without symptoms as "at low risk".
The scoring system should also be monitored in other medical and research activities.
In conclusion, we hope that further indirect evidence will emerge and we also ask readers to comment.
With regard to the examination of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases", we ask that the new national guidelines be followed and followed.
Our team will also update our guidelines on a regular basis to provide assistance.
Bangladesh has reported five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest number in a single day
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed that five new people died from COVID-19 that day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day from the virus.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the total number of cases included 114 recoveries and 33 home remedies.
The total number of deaths is 17.

Thailand plans to set up a curfew between 22:00 and 04:00.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that his administration has extended the curfew to May 1.
Shops in Australia set a limit on the number of toilet paper items that can be purchased
On Saturday night, Woolworths and Coles stores in Australia reduced the number of toilet paper to two and no more than one pack of toilet paper in all of those stores nationwide.
On Monday, ALDI also announced that one pack should not exceed one.
The limit values were announced as a pay-as-you-go notification, and on the stores' Facebook pages.
It was reported that consumers bought the toilet paper in bulk due to the COVID-19 fear when they had to quarantine.
On Wednesday, Woolworths reduced the number of household toilet paper packages per order.
The subsequent changes would have limited the number of people who would be allowed to use a single pack of four toilet paper products that were launched by Woolworths and Coles stores on March 4 and 5.
In a press release in March, Coles Store announced that under the restrictions set to not exceed one pack of four clean sheets, most stores are closing after an hour of closure, and announced that such purchases "never happened", while ALDI announced on Facebook on Tuesday that this was "unexpected".
Sales "surged sharply" last week, according to a Woolworths store spokesperson.
Costco's Canberra store also reduced the number to two packs of toilet paper last week.
To further reduce the shortage of toilet paper, Coles' store ordered larger packages from retailers and increased the frequency of cleaning, and Woolworths ordered more toilet paper, while ALDI brought in stock items for Wednesday's promotion sold out first.
Russell Zimmerman, CEO of the Australian Chamber of Commerce, said that merchants could increase sales, but the regulations on trucks that handle goods were put in place by the local council made it difficult.
He believes that commodity prices will rise, while retailers try to meet customer needs, and offer them fewer promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that as the products were sold out of stock early, some stores will not be able to offer Wednesday's promotion.
In a report on News.com.au, Dr Gary Mortimer, an economist at Queensland University of Technology, said that shops store at night.
He also declared that clean paper is a packaged product, which makes it less expensive to store, and when it is sold out, leaves more space on the defunct shelves, making the product more perceptible.
Russell Zimmerman of ABC News: Coles and Woolworths stores believe that getting more products on the shelves like toilet paper and pesticides available in bulk will reduce people's fears
Who Gives a Crap, a used toilet paper company, said the product was dumped last Wednesday.
News.com.au reports that Kimberly-Clark, a Kleenex cleaning cloth manufacturer, and Solaris Paper, a Sorbent cleaning paper manufacturer, have confirmed that they will be working 24/7 to reach the market.
Domain.com, a real estate brokerage website, announced that home sellers will be offering free cleaning papers to first-time homeowners in Melbourne, where the service is limited because customers have a working day off that coincides with the weekend.
The Thursday issue of NT News, a daily newspaper in Darwin, added eight cut-off pages for use as a clean sheet.
Stores were reluctant to set guidelines, according to a report by ABC Australia on March 3, which said they had no plans to set guidelines on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman went on to say that other best-selling products included masks, pesticides, dry foods, handwashing soap and farine.
The same was true outside Australia, where the British online retailer Ocado reduced Andres's toilet paper to no more than two packs of 12 on Sunday night.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 an epidemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the current COVID-19 outbreak caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus to be an epidemic.
While the term "epidemic" refers mainly to the spread of the disease in many countries, not specifically to its extent, WHO stressed the need for governmental intervention in its fight:
"Any country can change the direction of the pandemic.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, said: "The countries that are not aware of the virus are testing, treating, quarantining, welcoming those who have been infected and encouraging people to avoid it".
"We are deeply concerned about the rapid spread and spread of the pandemic and the lack of action to combat it.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former CEO of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the epidemic "has never happened".
In a statement to CNN in February, he said: Except for the flu, no other respiratory replacement virus has exceeded its apparent level and developed into a global epidemic.
Ghebreyesus also agreed, saying: "We have never seen a coronavirus pandemic.
He continues: And we have never seen a plague that can be effectively controlled.
The pandemic transformation follows the WHO's decision in January to declare the pandemic a public health emergency of global concern.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director General of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), said: "The pandemic is obviously making things worse".
On Thursday, the Associated Press reported that at least 126,000 people have been infected with COVID-19 worldwide, with more than 4,600 of them already dead.
The 201920 coronavirus pandemic is the current outbreak of the 2019CoV-19 virus, caused by the highly contagious influenza virus (SARS-CoV-2).
In December 2019, an outbreak was reported in Wuhan, China; on January 30, 2020, it was declared a global public health emergency, and on March 11, 2020, it was declared an epidemic.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million people had been infected with COVID-19 in 210 countries and territories, of which nearly 97,000 had died.
About 364,000 people were healed.
The mortality rate is 4% in China, while the global rate is between 13.04% in Algeria and 0.8% in New Zealand.
Symptoms include fever, coughing, and shortness of breath.
Signs include diarrhea and severe breathing problems.
When you are diagnosed with a disease, the symptoms begin to appear in about five days, but they can last from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or cure for the virus.
The primary treatment is to treat symptoms and help the patient stay healthy. Essential precautions include hand washing, mouth covering when touching, distance from others, monitoring and quarantine suspected infections.
Global leaders facing the pandemic are halting travel, quarantining, postponing, fighting the pandemic in their workplaces and closing down their businesses.
The pandemic has caused economic and social upheaval, the suspension or suspension of sporting, religious, political and cultural activities and the global supply shortage caused by the pandemic.
Schools and universities have closed nationally or regionally in 193 countries, affecting nearly 99.4 percent of the world's students.
The virus has also spread online, with reports of violence or discrimination against foreigners, especially Chinese, from East and Southeast Asia, and others from areas affected by the virus.
Due to reduced travel and the closure of large industries, air pollution and air pollution have decreased.
On December 31, 2019, the Health Services in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province) announced cases of measles caused by an unknown cause, and the testing began in early January 2020.
The patients have contacts with the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where the virus is suspected to have been transmitted from animals.
The virus that caused the outbreak known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus similar to the influenza, smallpox and SARS-CoV coronavirus. The first known case of a known case of the disease was reported on December 1, 2019, and the individual had no connection to the animal-related outbreak.
Other cases were first reported in December 2019, with two-thirds of them having contact with the market.
On March 3, 2020, unconfirmed reports by the South China Morning Post reported that a case reported on November 17, 2019, in a 55-year-old Hubei province, may be the first. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported a decline in new cases in China but a sharp increase in Italy, Iran and South Korea, with the number of new cases outside China exceeding the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be many unreported infections; especially those with mild symptoms.
As of 26 February, a relatively low incidence rate among young people was reported, with those under 19 accounting for 2.4% of the global incidence. UK government scientific adviser Patrick Vallance estimates that 60% of the UK population may become infected before receiving a vaccine.
The number of cases is the number of people tested for COVID-19, and the tests are validated according to government protocols.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland have imposed restrictions on testing for mild symptoms.
A study published on March 16 revealed that as of January 23, 86% of COVID-19 cases in China were undiagnosed, while 79% of cases were unregistered.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March showed that the number of cases in Italy was higher than reported.
The number of new cases (R0) of COVID-19 ranged from 1,4 to 2,4.
A study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the number could be as high as 5.7.
Most of the COVID-19 patients recover.
In patients with chronic symptoms, the incubation period from symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, but the most common is 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, nearly 97,000 people have died from COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, 80% of deaths were over the age of 60, and 75% were already associated with other conditions including heart disease and diabetes.The government-reported COVID-19 death figures were mostly those of people tested for COVID according to government protocols.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 may be higher than reported, as it does not include uninsured deaths, e.g.: deaths at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Some reports from Italy indicate that the number of deaths during the pandemic is higher than the government's official COVID death toll of 4-5 times.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said: "We know that the reported death toll is not the exact death toll, which coincides with the reported death toll in the United States. This death toll is often reached during epidemics such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak.
On February 1, the first death outside China occurred in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
By February 28, more than a dozen people outside China had already died in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
On March 13, more than forty countries and territories reported deaths, on every continent except Antarctica. Several measures are being used in various areas to calculate the death toll.
The figures vary by region and time, and are based on the number of deaths, the functioning of the medical system, prevention, the duration of the outbreak and population status such as age, sex and overall health.
Based on statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the average infection mortality rate was 6.0% (97,039,1/617 204) as of April 10, 2020.
The figures vary by region.
In China, the average mortality rate among infected persons decreased from 17.3% (symptomatically confirmed on 110 January 2020) to 0.7% (symptomatically confirmed after 1February 2020).Other measures include the CFR, which indicates the prevalence of infectious disease deaths, and the infectious rate (IFR), which indicates the prevalence of infectious disease deaths (either confirmed or not).
These figures are not based on error and follow specific individuals from infection to recovery or death.
Many universities have tried to count these numbers.
The University of Oxford's data-driven medical institute reports that the overall infection rate is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The high levels of this category correspond well with the results of the first COVID-19 test of vaccinated people in Germany and the statistics of the study show the mortality rate based on the test.
WHO says the epidemic is preventable.
The duration of the outbreak and the time of the outbreak are not known and may vary from region to region.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University said: Without control, epidemics often persist and slow down when infections are no longer contagious.
But it is difficult to predict the future for now.
The Chinese government's senior medical adviser, Zhong Nanshan, announced that: "The pandemic may be over by June" when all countries comply with WHO guidelines to curb the spread of the pandemic.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 will spread from one region to another, possibly for a year or two.
According to a study by Imperial College under the direction of Neil Ferguson, the availability of human immunity and other measures must be complied with "until a vaccine is available (in 18 months or longer)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said: "I think it's unlikely that the coronavirus, because it's so contagious, will go away completely and it could become a disease that comes back every year.
The recurrence of this highly contagious virus will be due to the human body's immune system and viral mutations.
Symptoms of COVID-19 may be unique and infected individuals may not show symptoms.
The most common symptoms are fever (88%) and coughing (68%).
Rare symptoms include fatigue, dizziness, shortness of breath, shortness of breath, chest and shoulder pain, sore throat, headache, cold, sneezing, coughing and bleeding, diarrhea or bruising. WHO reports that approximately one in six people will be infected with the virus and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identifies symptoms that may include respiratory problems, coughing or shortness of breath, sudden tremors, difficulty waking, facial or lip pain, and those with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms do not improve.
If some infected individuals may not show symptoms, if no symptoms are present but the test results indicate infection, then researchers recommend that those who have been infected should be closely monitored and tested for infection.
China reports that the overall symptom-free rate ranges from a few to 44%.
The average time to show symptoms (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) is from one to 14 days, usually a few days. A dubious example is the 30% drop in the number of people with COVID-19 who no longer smell from the previous level to 15%.
Some of the details of the infectious disease are not yet clear.
The most commonly transmitted disease is thought to be the excessive contact with the flow of water when a person moves, crawls, or approaches another person within 1 or 2 meters.
Studies have shown that uncovered coughing can cause waterfalls to rise from 4.5 to 8.2 meters.
Others suggest that the virus may be transmitted from prolonged airborne fluids that can be released when a person is speaking. Respiratory fluids can also be released when a person is breathing while speaking, primarily airborne viruses.
These fluids can enter the mouth or nose of people who are very close to them or inhaled into their lungs.
Some medical procedures such as pulmonary resuscitation and respiratory resuscitation (CPR) can allow these respiratory fluids to reach the air and spread through the air.
It can spread when a person touches a viral area such as the skin and touches the face, nose, or mouth.
While there is concern that the virus may be transmitted through the sand, these risks are thought to be very small.
The Chinese government has denied that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted from infected strains and that the germs pass into infected mouths. The virus is most contagious in the first three days after symptoms appear, although it is possible to spread before symptoms begin and during the severity of the disease.
People who are tested and diagnosed three days before symptoms appear are more likely to become infected before symptoms become apparent.
There have been few reports of infections that have not only been laboratory-confirmed, but non-symptomatic infections have been identified in some countries during the follow-up of infection cases.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) reports that while it is not clear how easily a disease can be transmitted, an infected person can infect two or three others.
In particular, the virus can last up to three days on a plastic (poriporopyrene) material and 304 days on a stainless steel, one day on a carton and up to four days on a copper metal.
However, the incidence varies according to weather and temperature. Pets and other animals have been tested for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although UK authorities recommend that people wash their hands after touching animals and after working in areas where infected people may have worked.
The severe influenza virus (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, derived from three cases of measles related to influenza A in Wuhan.
All forms of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are similar to those of the coronavirus. Not in the human body, the virus is killed by a domestic soap that destroys the liver and covers it.
It is thought to have evolved from animals.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronavirus belongs to the same group as Betakoronavirus, which belongs to the Saribekovirus family (family B) and both are of fungal origin.
It is 96% and the genome of other batch coronavirus tests (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, researchers in China found a single amino acid genome-shaped difference between viral extracts from insects and human extracts.
So far, a total genome comparison has shown that up to 92% of the genome of the bacterial coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 is insufficient to confirm that the bacteria were first infected.
Viral infection can be tested on a provisional basis based on the symptoms, pending a full confirmation using the rRT-PCR laboratory of infected flow or CT.
A comparative PCR and CT study in Wuhan showed that CT detects viral patterns more accurately than PCR, although not fully defined, some of the features of this laboratory method are similar to other measles and other diseases.
As of March 2020, the American College of Cardiology has stated that: CT should not be used for diagnosis or used as the primary method of COVID-19.
The WHO has published a number of RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was released on 17 January.
The test uses a real-time rRT-PCR laboratory test.
The test may be performed on respiratory or blood samples.
Generally, answers are available in hours or days.
The test is usually performed using a nasal sample device, although the nasal sample may also be used. Many laboratories and companies are working on blood tests and immunosuppression.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these methods have been shown to provide accurate measurements for use in a wide range of applications.
In the United States, Cellex blood tests are approved as a treatment but only for use in approved laboratories.
Metastatic scans and CT scans are used to test for symptoms including the presence of GMO or fluid in the lungs.
The Italian Association for Transurethral Medicine is developing an international database of transurethral researches of patients.
Due to its association with other diseases such as adenovirus, PCR-based metal samples cannot specifically detect COVID-19 infection.
A large study in China that compared the results of chest CT and PCR tests showed that while these tests were not very effective, they were faster and more accurate in showing the viral profile, which could be considered an epidemiological test.
CNN's artificial intelligence-based methodology has been developed to detect viral imaging patterns using a machine and CT scanner.
Measures to prevent the spread of the disease generally include proper physical hygiene, hand washing, avoiding touching the face, nose or mouth without washing hands, and coughing or sweating with a cloth and immediately throwing the cloth away from the garbage can.
Those who have been infected are advised to wear a mask when in public.
Prevention measures are essential to prevent the spread of the virus. Many governments have banned or prohibited people from making unnecessary travel to and from countries affected by the outbreak.
However, in many parts of the world, the virus has spread to the point where a citizen infects another.
This means that the virus is spreading in the community, and some residents do not know where and how it is transmitted. Medical providers who would treat a potentially infected person are advised to observe regular precautions, avoidance guidelines, face protection. Tracking the contacts is an important way for health authorities to identify the source of infection and prevent further spread.
The government's use of local mobile phone data has raised privacy concerns where Amnesty International and more than 100 other organisations have issued statements calling for the end of this surveillance.
Several applications were developed or proposed for voluntary use, and on April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups sought a privacy-friendly solution such as using Bluetooth technology to store data for mobile phones that were coming together.
Users of these phones receive messages if they have ever approached a person who has been tested for COVID-19. Some misinformation is being spread in order to prevent infection; for example, squeezing the nose and rubbing the mouth with oral medicines do not kill the virus.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine, but many companies are working on it.
Hand washing is essential to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds; in particular, after leaving the toilet or after their hands are apparently contaminated, before eating, after breathing, coughing or sneezing.
This is because when the virus is not present in the human body, it is killed by home soap, which has the ability to break down the virus's protective tissue.
The CDC also recommends that a hand sanitizer be used that contains at least 60% fat when soap and water are not available.
WHO advises against touching the face, nose or mouth with hands that are unsightly.
Viral pathogens in a variety of locations can be killed with targeted agents (within one minute of exposure to an anti-inflammatory agent on a stainless steel), including 6271% ethanol, 50100% isoporopanor, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.27.5% povidone iodine.
Other drugs, such as benzariconium chloride and korohexigisidine gurukonate, do not kill the fungus effectively.
The CDC requires that if suspected or confirmed COVID infections occur in an office or daycare setting, anywhere such as an office, toilet, public place, electronic devices such as tablets, operating systems, a computer printer, remote control and ATM equipment used by patients, they should be disinfected.
Health facilities require people to cover their mouths and nostrils with their elbow corners or a garment when they are stretching or tearing and immediately discard the garment.
Medical masks are the best treatment for possible infections, as wearing a mask prevents the amount of wheat and the amount of waste released when you are spitting, chewing and chewing.
WHO has issued guidelines on when and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, Wearing a mask reduces the frequency of facial contact, which is where the disease often occurs when the hands are not properly clean.
WHO requires non-sick people to wear face masks only when they are at high risk of infection, such as when they are taking care of someone with COVID-19, and recognizes that wearing face masks protects people from touching their face.
Many countries have begun to encourage their citizens to wear masks.
In the United States, the CDC requires people to wear masks made from non-medical clothing. In particular, China requires non-patients to wear medical masks that are injected after use, especially when approaching others at a distance of less than 1 meter.
Hong Kong requires people to wear medical masks when traveling or in public.
Health authorities in Thailand would encourage people to work from home with masks worn and washed daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, people are not allowed to go outside without a mask or a nose or mouth covering.
On March 16, Vietnam urged everyone to wear a mask to meet crowds in self-defense and protection.
The Australian government has ordered everyone entering a grocery store to wear a mask.
Israel urged all citizens to wear masks when they were in public.
April 1; Taiwan, which produces more than 10 million masks a day, has ordered passengers on rail and buses to wear masks.
Panama has enacted a law requiring the wearing of face masks whenever you go out and requiring that homemade face masks be made for those who cannot afford factory-made ones.
Masks are widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Interpersonal distancing (also known as distance-keeping) includes activities designed to prevent infection in order to reduce the spread of the virus spread between people.
The measures include lockdowns, travel cancellations and closures of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres or shops.
Individuals can use social distancing to stay at home, reduce travel, avoid crowds, use social distancing and social distancing.
Currently, many countries are regulating or requiring people in areas affected by the outbreak to avoid contact.
The maximum number of people who are required by the US government and agencies to attend a meeting was quickly reduced from 250 (when COVID-19 is known to be present in the area) to 50, then reduced to 10.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and those with other conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and immune deficiency risk were advised by the CDC to stay home if they are at risk of being infected by their peers. In late March 2020, WHO and other health organizations began replacing the term "nearsight" with "keeping distance", to clarify that the target is working while communication is being maintained.
The use of the term "non-communicable" has led people to feel the need to isolate themselves, rather than encourage them to continue to communicate with others through other means.
The instructions include that you should only have sex with a partner without the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Home quarantine is mandatory for people who have been tested positive for COVID-19 and are suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued clear guidelines on the best way to quarantine. Many countries have mandated or mandated quarantine of all people living in areas with infection.
Intensive quarantine instructions have been given to those in high-risk groups.
Those who may have had contact with someone with COVID-19 and who have recently travelled to infected countries or regions are advised to quarantine for 14 days from the last day of contact with the virus.
Measures to control the epidemic are to contain or stop and reduce its spread.
Prevention at the outbreak stage and with the aim of monitoring and quarantining the infection and taking further measures to control infection and prevent the spread of disease should not be continued in other communities.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of the epidemic, then the focus is on reducing the spread: measures are taken to reduce the spread and reduce the impact of the epidemic on the healthcare sector and society.
Prevention and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time.
Epidemic control requires strong containment measures to reduce the number of new infections to less than 1. One of the main steps in the fight against infectious diseases is to try to reduce the prevalence of infections known as reducing the number of new infections.
It reduces healthcare services' overcrowding and access to adequate time for vaccines and treatments.
Non-medical infection control measures include the management of the epidemic through specific prevention measures such as cleaning of the nails, wearing masks and quarantine; community-based measures such as closing schools and suspending public activities; the need to raise awareness and response among the public; and environmental measures such as evacuation of busy areas. Other significant measures were taken to combat the epidemic in China as the epidemic spread was on the rise such as the quarantine of all cities and the imposition of strict travel restrictions.
Other countries have also taken various measures to curb the spread of the virus.
South Korea has begun mass testing and quarantining some areas and announcing infected trips.
Singapore has provided financial support for quarantined infected people and imposed heavy fines on those who did not.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and punished the smugglers of medical equipment. The United Kingdom and the United States have also indicated that reducing infection (reducing the number of cases without stopping the spread of the epidemic) and stopping it (reducing the number of new cases) have been a major challenge.
Measures to reduce the number of infections can reduce the excessive increase in the need for medical services by 2/3 and the mortality rate by half, but they do not prevent the death of thousands of people and medical services continue to receive a large number of patients.
Prevention of the outbreak is the best option but should continue as long as the virus is still in the human body (or until a vaccine is available, depending on the previous case), the infection is contagious and the virus is reversible as soon as the measures are relaxed.
Long-term action to contain the pandemic is a social and economic disaster.
No specific medicines have been approved to reduce the prevalence of COVID-19, but development is ongoing, including the evaluation of standard antiviral drugs.
Taking flu medication without a prescription, drinking plenty of water, and resting can help reduce symptoms.
Because of the heat, oxygen therapy, hydration and respiratory support are necessary.
Steroid use can lead to illness.
Several drugs that have been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being studied to determine whether they can be used to treat COVID-19.
WHO has reported that:  Traditional home remedies may reduce the severity of symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The capacity-building and transformation of the medical facilities to meet the needs of COVID-19 patients is defined by WHO as a key response to the pandemic.
ECDC and WHO's European Regional Office have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary healthcare providers to change the practices of other departments, such as making laboratory services focused on COVID-19 testing, halting unnecessary medical procedures, isolating and quarantining COVID-19 cases, and increasing the capacity of emergency services with training of physicians and increasing the number of ventilators and beds.
There are several sources of information about the origin of the first infection (the first confirmed virus).
The first known case of the new coronavirus was reported on December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
In a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei has been increasing.
The cases were mainly linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale wholesaler, which sells live animals, and other reports suggested that the virus was derived from some of the animals; in other words, from animals. The cases of an unknown cause of measles were examined on December 26 and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian of Hubei Provincial Hospital, who announced the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
On December 30, a team of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital informed their colleagues of a "coronavirus-like SARS" outbreak.
Eight of the doctors, including Li Wenliang, were interviewed by the Police for spreading rumors, while another, Ai Fen, was warned by his officials to bring the matter up.
The Wuhan Health Commission issued a public statement on 31 December informing the WHO.
Health authorities were informed of a large number of cases of measles in Wuhan, with no known cause, and a trial was launched in early January.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces of China, fueled by new travel in China and Wuhan's presence as a hub and main hub for regional rail travel.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases in a single day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The government's latest data showed 6,174 cases on January 20, 2020, and by March 26, the United States had surpassed China and Italy in the highest number of confirmed cases worldwide. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases worldwide were reported; more than 97,000 deaths and more than 364,000 recovery.
Nearly 200 countries and territories had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, Schengen countries have reduced travel and introduced border controls.
Countries have implemented pandemic-like measures (also known as lockdowns) and measures. As of April 2, nearly 300 million people, or nearly 90% of the population, would have followed a lockdown-like program in the United States, while more than 50 million in the Philippines, nearly 59 million people in South Africa and 1.3 billion people in India were in lockdown.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people on the planet were in a lockdown-like system, rising to 2.6 billion two days later, nearly a third of the global population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was first reported on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; unconfirmed reports indicate that the first case was reported on 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian followed up with patients with epilepsy from an unknown cause on December 26, and his hospital notified Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
A primary genetic test for patients on December 27, 2019 showed the presence of SARS-like strains of the coronavirus.
A public statement was issued by the Wuhan City Health Commission on December 31.
The WHO was also informed on the same day.
In this announcement, Wuhan doctors were warned by the Police for "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
The National Health Commission of China initially declared that there was no "comprehensive evidence" of human contagion.
In late January, the Chinese government announced that it had launched a major crackdown, which was later clarified by the Chinese Communist Party's Secretary General Xi Jinping, that "the people must fight the war" to contain the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as the "most-populous lockdown in human history", the travel restrictions announced on January 23 restrict travel to and from Wuhan, which has been extended to 15 cities in Hubei, reaching a population of nearly 57 million.
Private cars were parked in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (25 January) have been cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of Huoshenshan Provisional Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Other hospitals were later built as Leishenshan Hospital, to care for other patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China has also renovated 14 other buildings in Wuhan, including conference facilities and stadiums for temporary hospitals.On January 26, the government issued additional measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, including issuing health guidelines for travelers and extending the Spring Festival.
Universities and schools in the country were also closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macau have adopted a variety of measures; in particular, those related to education and universities.
Remote-operation measures have been taken in different regions of China.
Travel restrictions have been implemented both inside and outside Hubei.
Public transportation has been changed by the Chinese Museum to temporary closure.
Traffic monitoring was carried out in several cities, where an estimated 760 million people (more than half of the total population) were ordered to leave their homes.

The German short-term pension scheme was also adopted by France and Britain.
The arts and cultural heritage sectors have been severely affected by the pandemic, as it has affected the operations of companies and individuals (both employer and self-employed) around the world.
Cultural and artistic organizations have sought to address their (often publicly funded) responsibilities to preserve cultural heritage, protect workers and the public, and assist artists wherever possible.
As of March 2020, worldwide and in various ways, museums, libraries, exhibition halls, and other cultural institutions were permanently closed and their trade shows, events, and exhibitions were suspended or postponed.
To address the problem, steps have been taken to implement additional technology services. Another recent and important decision to accelerate the pandemic's decline is the suspension of all exhibition, major sporting and other public events including music concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican announced that the celebration of Holy Week in Rome, the last week of the Christian era in Gisibo, was suspended.
Many dioceses have asked older Christians to stay home rather than attend church on Sundays; some congregations have conducted meetings on radio, Internet, or television while others have arranged for the meetings to be monitored by their cars.
When the Catholic Church closed the dioceses and chapels and the main square of St. Peter's Church to the public, other churches permanently suspended the meetings and restricted the number of people gathered in churches, mosques, synagogues, and other places.
The Ministry of Health in Iran announced that the suspension of Friday prayers in the affected areas and shrines was later closed, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and local residents from entering the shrines in Makkah and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the world's greatest sporting disruption since the end of World War II.
Many tournaments have been postponed or postponed, including the UEFA 201920, the 201920, the British Championships, the 2020 European Championships, the 201920, and the 201920 United States Handball Championships.
The pandemic also disrupted the 2020 Summer Olympics schedule, which was scheduled to begin in late July; on March 24, the International Olympic Committee announced that the games "will be moved to a later date of 2020 but not later than summer 2021".
This has led to a massive online gambling boom, with many gambling sites reporting a sharp increase in subscribers, and entertainment has also been affected, with many bands suspending or postponing their tours.
Large theaters such as Broadway have suspended all entertainment.
Some artists have sought ways to continue to produce and share their work online as a replacement for traditional live performances, online shows, or online "party" for artists to host, thus spreading, and even promoting their work.
There are funny images on the Internet that focus on the coronavirus because many people wanted to be funny and entertained before they knew where things were going.
Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a growing level of discrimination, xenophobia, and racism against people of Chinese and East Asian descent, as well as people from high-risk areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Fear, prejudice, and conflict have been rampant in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports in February (when most patients were still in China) showed racial stereotypes in various groups around the world, saying that the Chinese were either eligible for the virus or would receive a fair punishment.
Some African countries have also experienced an increase in hatred of the Chinese.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei said they were discriminated against based on their ethnicity.
There has been support for Chinese, both physically and online, and for those in the areas affected by the virus.
As the epidemic spreads to new countries, the citizens of Italy, the first European country to have the highest number of COVID-19 cases, may face a problem of self-hypnosis and xenophobia.The citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea on the ground have signed a wake-up call for other countries not to allow Chinese citizens to enter their countries in order to stop the spread of the epidemic.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan has become popular on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asian people in Britain and the United States have reported an increase in racial violence and attacks.
US President Donald Trump has been criticized for calling the coronavirus a "Chinese virus", a term that has been viewed by critics as racist and anti-Chinese.
The protestors in the Ukraine took buses carrying displaced Ukrainians and foreigners from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students come from northeastern India, which shares a border with China, and study in major Indian cities as victims of the coronavirus pandemic.
The president of the West Bengal branch of the Bharatiya Janata Party, Dilip Ghosh, said that the Chinese are destroying the environment "and that is why God punishes them".
This was quickly condemned by the Chinese Embassy in Kolkata, declaring it "inappropriate". In China, xenophobia and racism were exacerbated by the epidemic, where foreigners were called "foreign garbage" and should be disposed of.
Many websites that charge visitors have removed some or all of the fees charged for news about the coronavirus.
Science writers have published scientific papers on the epidemic and are available to anyone who wishes to see them.
Some scientists have chosen to share their recent research findings with others on application servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) respiratory tract and SARS-CoV-2 related viruses includes viral detection and immune system detection.
The presence of viruses in the sampled tests is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the coronavirus RNA.
This test is unique and is intended solely for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA.
It is used to confirm the early infection or recovery.
Identification of immune systems (blood tests) can be used for both testing and monitoring of populations.
Immunological tests indicate the number of cases, including those with symptoms that are too small to be reported to the authorities.
The exact number of deaths from the epidemic and the level of unemployment in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to the limited number of people who had been tested, as of March 2020, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus among its population.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there was a significant difference in the number of tests performed in all countries.
This change can also have a significant impact on mortality, which is likely to be highly promoted in some countries.
Using rapid transmission and analysis (rRT-PCR) tests, the diagnosis can be made using respiratory tests available using a variety of methods, including oral or oral tests.
The results are generally available in a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test with throat samples is the only reliable method during the first week of the disease.
The virus can then pass through the throat as it continues to spread through the lungs.
For those who have been tested and found to be infected in the second week, it is advisable to repeat a variety of tests such as a screening test.
One of the latest PCR tests was conducted at CharitÃ© in Berlin in January 2020 using rapid rRT-PCR (Rast-Return and Analysis) and 250,000 devices provided by the World Health Organization.
The UK had also scheduled a test by 23 January 2020. On 28 January 2020, South Korean company Kogenebiotech has scheduled a PCR-based test of a clinical device for detecting SARS-CoV-2 (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It searches for the "E" virus that is transmitted by the human coronavirus strain, as well as the RdRp virus that is expressed in SARS-CoV-2.In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to be approved by the National Institute of Medical Devices to use SARS CoV-2 PCR-based testing equipment.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing RT-PCR Diagnostic equipment for testing the new Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) in public laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
One of three cell-mediated tests in the older version of the test instrument resulted in vague results due to the use of inadequate medications, as well as testing challenges at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of 100 tests per day being successfully tested throughout February 2020.
The two-part test was not expected to be reliable until February 28, 2020, and until then state and local laboratories were allowed to begin testing.
The test has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use. Commercial laboratories in the United States began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced that a nationwide RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing system was available.
Quest Diagnostics has also conducted nationwide COVID-19 testing available as of March 9, 2020.
No limitation has been announced; collection and processing of samples taken must be done in accordance with the requirements of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).
In Russia, the COVID-19 test is developed and implemented by the State Institute of Virological Research and Technology in Biology VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the Federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Development (FDAR) began testing the virus. On March 12, 2020, it was announced that the Mayo Clinic had developed a device capable of testing the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics was approved by the FDA to develop a virus testing machine that would deliver a maximum response time of 3.5 hours, allowing one machine to test 4,128 people in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories to conduct testing on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had granted similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received FDA approval to use the emergency procedure for a 45-minute test.
The FDA has approved a test that uses a technology to increase the thermometric values of nucleic acid instead of PCR.
Since this does not require a heat exchanger sequence, this method can provide a clean response in about five minutes and a clean response in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the United States and Abbot plans to increase capacity to 50,000 doses per day. In Taiwan, a test using immune responses to N-type coronaviruses is being developed, and it is hoped that it will provide a response in 15 to 20 minutes, as a rapid flu-testing machine.
In March 2020, research papers concluded that "initially, a chest transition is not very useful for diagnosis, and the imaging and computed tomography (CT) techniques may be available even before symptoms begin".
Features of CT transduction technology include the ability to view all sides of the lungs, with clear side, middle and posterior projections.
Inflammation of the lower lung, excessive pressure on certain parts of the lungs increases as the disease progresses.
A study that compared PCR and CT tests in Wuhan to determine the source of the outbreak showed that the outbreak was more severe in Wuhan as it was mixed with other respiratory diseases.
As of March 2020, the U.S. National Academy of Plastic Surgery has mandated that "the Wuhan method should no longer be used to test for COVID-19".As of March 2020, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) requires PCR to be used for early screening.
One of the most effective ways the body's immune system can fight infection is by producing immune systems including IgM and IgG.
This can help detect infections in humans from day 7 or after initial detection, monitor safety levels and conduct community monitoring.
The brain used for mass testing in many medical laboratories will be used for analysis, but the availability of results will depend on the speed of the process.
In standard laboratories, one sample of blood is typically used, although sequential samples may be used to monitor the anatomy.
At another test site, one normal blood sample was found to have ruptured the skin.
Unlike PCR, a pre-filing test is not required prior to testing.On March 26, 2020, the FDA announced that 29 notified agencies were now eligible to provide active immunosuppression tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA for emergency response.At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostic received European accreditation for their test equipment, which can identify IgG and IgA antibodies in viral immunity in blood tests.
The infection detection capability can reach hundreds of tests that are tested in hours and then much faster than the PCR test that is commonly used to test for viral RNA.
The body's immune system is usually detected within 14 days of the onset of infection.In early April, the UK found that no measuring equipment for the body's immune system was available and that none could be used adequately.
Hong Kong has established a home-based approach for every suspected infection, with the emergency department providing a "specific tool", which is then scanned and returned to respond later. The NHS has announced that it plans to introduce a home-based screening system for suspected infections, which will eliminate the risk of a patient becoming contagious when they come to the hospital, or require a disinfectant to be injected into the vehicle that brought the patient. In the process of taking a COVID-19 vaccine test, the doctor performs it in an informal manner that complies with all guidelines.
The testing facility for people in their vehicles has enabled South Korea to conduct some of the fastest and largest tests in the world. In Germany, the Medical Insurance Association announced on March 2 that it has the capacity to perform nearly 12,000 emergency tests per day and that about 10,700 have been performed in the previous week.
Costs are covered by health insurance if the examination is prescribed by a doctor.
According to Robert Koch, president of the Institute, Germany has a total weekly test capacity of 160,000.
From March 19, the test has been conducted in many major cities.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of tests performed in Germany was unknown, as only cases were reported.
The first laboratory study reported that at least 483,295 people had been tested in the week of 12/2020, including the 12/2020 census, of which 33,491 (6.9%) were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital have developed and tested a method of simultaneous testing of 64 patients, where they take tests and repeat them later if anyone is infected.In Wuhan, a 2,000 m2 emergency laboratory called "Huo-Yan" ç«ç¼ in Chinese, or "Fire Eye" in Mandarin, was opened to the public on 5 February 2020 by the BGI, which can test more than 10,000 people a day.
Construction work was supervised by BGI founder Wang Jian and lasted for 5 days, samples taken showed that infection in Hubei would increase by 47% and the cost of dealing with quarantine would double if these measurement capabilities were not available.
Wuhan Laboratory was immediately followed by Huo-Yanmu Laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in all 12 cities in China.
As of March 4, 2020, a total of 50,000 doses are being produced daily. The fast and user-friendly method developed by Origami Assays can test 1,122 COVID-19 patients using just 93 doses. This standard method can be performed in small laboratories without the need for irrigation robots.
As of March, the decline and lack of laboratory English drugs were a major challenge to mass testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This led some authors to write about the preparation of a test run that requires it to be heated to 98 Â°C (208 Â°F) for 5 minutes to produce the cells that cause the test to be repeated. On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was the first country to be able to test its population in a large proportion compared to other countries, with the country having a system to test almost all of its inhabitants.
This was due to the combination of the ability to test people in their cars, and the purchase of multiple-person testing labs in Group 42 and BGI (based on Huo-Yan's rapid-testing labs).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory can handle more than 10,000 RT-PCR tests per day and is the first of its kind in the world to operate outside of China.
Various test methods cover different components of the coronavirus strain that have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization has approved Germany's approach to manufacturing equipment exported to developing countries that are not able to afford to carry their own.
On January 17, 2020, the Germans announced their own methodology, a methodology developed by the US Centers for Disease Control was not available until January 28, which delayed testing in the United States. China and the United States had concerns about the lack of confidence in the safety of the available test equipment, and these countries and Australia were not able to meet the market for the equipment they had and to comply with the advice of medical experts.
However, experts say that South Korea's introduction of a comprehensive testing system has helped to slow the spread of the new coronavirus.
The testing capabilities, especially in independent laboratories, have been built over many years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called on countries to increase the number of tests and programs associated with the initiative as the best way to slow the spread of COVID-19. The growing need for epidemiological testing equipment due to the spread of the virus has led to the large number of these being funded by US laboratories, raising a serious challenge in providing the public with the necessary equipment and medicines for the treatment of the pandemic.
In March 2020, China announced that there were concerns about the accuracy of its testing equipment.
In the United States, the National Institute of Disease Control's equipment was defective, and the government removed the barriers to independent testing. Spain bought the equipment from Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, a Chinese company but found it to be inadequate.
The institute explained that incorrect results may be caused by poorly collecting tests or using the tools correctly.
The Spanish Ministry said it would remove the market for false-results equipment and replace the Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the equipment purchased by the Czech Republic from China produced false results.
Prime Minister MatoviÄ has requested that it be thrown into the Danube. AteÅ Kara, the Turkish Health Minister, said that the diagnostic equipment purchased from China is not suitable and therefore should not be used.
Testing, followed by quarantine and search for contacts with SARS-CoV-2 infections, were successful.
Researchers working in VÃ², Italy, where the first COVID-19 death in Italy occurred, double-checked the population of 3,400 over a ten-day period.
Nearly half of those diagnosed were without symptoms, and all who showed up were quarantined.
Restrictions on travel to other areas have completely stopped the new outbreak.
Due to extensive surveillance of infection cases, traffic control, testing and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus outbreak in Singapore was significantly lower than in other developed countries and was conducted without the complete closure of restaurants and shopping malls.
Most activities were suspended, and Singapore began advising residents to stay home on March 28, but schools reopened in time after the holidays on March 23.
Many countries also affected by the pandemic have introduced a system for detecting contacts, banning domestic travel, testing, quarantine, and staying at home but not too extreme, such as Iceland and South Korea.
Statistical studies have shown that countries with higher population densities and higher death rates have lower death rates, perhaps because they have the ability to identify those with fewer or fewer symptoms.
The WHO requires countries with insufficient testing capacity and sufficient and capable laboratories to submit their COVID-19 tests to the first five confirmed cases and the first ten confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 16 UN Health Organization-designated laboratories for validation of the tests.
Of the 16 sample laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the entry "Infected as a percentage of test subjects" may change depending on the national diagnostic policy.
A country that tests only hospitalized people will have a higher incidence of infections in the tests compared to a country that tests all its population, whether or not they have symptoms, unless otherwise noted.
Hand washing, also known as hand cleansing, is the act of cleaning the hands to remove dirt, oils, germs, or other undesirable substances.
Regular hand washing during "critical times" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea, cholera, and oral infections.
People can get respiratory diseases such as influenza or the common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their face, nose or mouth (i.e., the organs with a wart).
The five main times during the day when hand washing and soap are not necessary include: before and after washing, after rubbing or changing the baby's diapers, before feeding, before and after cooking or after eating raw meat, fish, or chicken.
If soap and water are not available, hands can be washed using ash. The World Health Organization recommends that people wash their hands:
Before, during, and after preparing a meal.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing the baby's diapers or after cleaning the baby after using a toilet.
After coughing, sneezing, or sweating.
After touching an animal, feeding it, or cleaning its filth.
Hand hygiene in medicine refers to medical hygiene practices.
Washing your hands before administering medication or before taking care of a patient can prevent or significantly reduce the spread of disease.
The main purpose of hand washing is to clean hands of any disease (bacteria, viruses, or other pathogens) and of any medication that may cause disease or illness.
This is especially important for food preparers and healthcare professionals, but it is also a good practice for everyone.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing other causes of epilepsy; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce the mortality rate of domestic babies.
A 2013 study found that proper hand washing can contribute to healthy development in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality from respiratory and urinary tract diseases can be reduced with simple behavioral modification, such as handwashing with soap.
This simple approach can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Handwashing promotion can reduce the incidence of diarrhea by about a third and this is equivalent to providing clean water to low-income communities.
A 48% reduction in urinary tract infections can be attributed to washing hands with soap. Handwashing with soap is the only effective and inexpensive way to prevent urinary tract infections and severe respiratory diseases (ARIs), which should be a practice in the home, school and the wider community.
Coronary artery disease, the most serious respiratory disease, is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, claiming the lives of about 1.8 million children annually.
Both measles and polio kill about 3.5 million children each year.
According to the World Children's Fund (UNICEF), the use of soap before and after a regular use of the toilet can save more lives than any vaccine or other treatment and reduce deaths from diarrhea by nearly half and deaths from severe respiratory illnesses by a quarter, according to the World Children's Fund (UNICEF).
Hand washing is often included in other sanitation activities such as water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH).
Hand washing also protects against skin infections caused by working with others.
A minor side effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage due to excessive dry skin.
A 2012 study in Denmark found that excessive hand washing can lead to a long, thick skin, commonly called hand skin disease, which is more common in healthcare professionals.
Excessive hand washing is also seen as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
Five important periods during the day, including hand washing and soap, are needed to reduce the transmission of oral and urinary tract infections: after using the toilet (stop, rinse), after stirring (turn the hips), before feeding, before and after cooking/preparing meals or after eating raw meat, fish, or chicken.
Other methods of hand washing should be used to prevent infection, including before and after treatment of a wound or ulcer; after sweating, coughing, or sneezing; after touching animal waste or animal care; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, there is a low rate of handwashing with soap.
A 2015 handwashing survey of 54 countries found an average of 38.7% of households using soap to wash their hands. A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia had a high rate of 97%; the United States had almost 77%; and China had a low rate of 23%. There is currently a trend towards raising the public to wash their hands with soap in critical situations.
The Health Care Essentials Program implemented by the Philippine Department of Education is a good example of activities aimed at improving children's health and education.
The use of gastric bypass twice a year, combined with daily handwashing with soap, daily toothbrushing with flush, is the basis of this national program.
It has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of bacteria from the skin is enhanced by adding soap or cleaning agents to the skin.
The main benefits of soaps and hygiene products are reducing the barriers to quenching and increasing the efficiency of quenching.
Only water does not cleanse the skin properly because the oil and grease, like the earth's crust, do not dissolve easily in water.
Cleaning is associated with the use of sufficient water.
Because non-hydraulic soaps can be reused, they can keep bacteria infected by previous users.
A small number of studies have examined the infectious pathogens of contaminated soap and concluded that contamination is not possible because the pathogens are cleared by the urine.
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) still says that "water soap and its use without the need for a touch is the best option".
Infectious soap has been highly praised by those who are interested in taking care of their health.
There is no evidence to date that antibiotics or pesticides are used to treat known antibiotics.
However, disinfectant soaps contain pesticides such as triclosan, which has a large list of insects that cannot be digested.
So while antibiotics are not selected from antibiotic soaps, they may not be as effective as advertised.
In addition to protecting the environment and skin, the product may contain acids (acetic acid, acetic acid, lactic acid) such as wheat inhibitors, benzoic acid, antibacterial and other skin proteins (bacterium, protein, menthol, and other plant-derived medicines).An in-depth study by the University of Oregon School of Public Health found that soap has the same ability to prevent disease and to prevent infectious diseases as soap designed to fight disease.
Hot water that can be used to wash hands is not hot enough to kill infectious bacteria.
infectious bacteria grow very quickly at body temperature (37 Â°C).
However, hot, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water in removing natural oils from soil and pollutants.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific research has shown that using hot water is not effective in reducing the amount of germs on the hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand sanitizer is a hand sanitizer that does not contain water.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, hand washing with disinfectants (commonly known as hand sanitizers) became popular and popular.
Most is made from isopropyl or ethanol resins which are made by mixing a carbomer with a sweetener or adding a flavor like a griserine to a liquid or paste to facilitate its use and reduce the effects of alcohol on the body.
Adding open hydrogen peroxide increases immunity. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60 to 95% sugar can be effective in killing germs.
Hand sanitizers contain antibacterial agents, antibacterial agents (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and other viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccines, influenza, and hepatitis) as well as viruses that cause hepatitis.
Hand sanitizer products have a 70% kill rate of 99.97% (3.5 decibels, equivalent to 35 decibels) of hand bacteria within 30 seconds of use and a 99.99% to 99.999% (about 4 to 5 decreases) of hand bacteria within 1 minute of use. Hand sanitizer products are highly effective against infectious bacteria but have a low viral resistance.
Hand sanitizers are not effective against Norwalk's common gastrointestinal disease. Hand sanitizers should be used in a clean or spread manner on both hands.
The front and back of the hands and the middle and end of both hands are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the water, foam, or cleanser dries.
Washing the fingers with both hands is essential. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing with disinfectants, especially if the hands are found to be contaminated.
The continued use of this method is based on its ease of use and rapid disinfection of contaminants; however, this method should not replace the standard method of hand washing unless soap and water are available.
Frequent use of hand sanitizers with a cough can cause dry skin unless the addition of such a product soften or dampens the skin.
This dryness from acne can be reduced or eliminated by glycelin or other skin softening agents.
In clinical trials, hand sanitizers contain a mild but also more skin-softening agent that makes the skin less dense than soaps or antibiotics.
Skin rashes, wrinkles, or body disorders caused by a hand sanitizer are rare.
The low risk of skin damage makes this technique more common than hand washing with soap and water.
Although effective, waterless hand sanitizers do not clean the hands to remove all dirt, but only remove contaminated bacteria.
This is why hand sanitizers such as soap and water are not as effective at preventing the spread of many viruses, because the virus remains on the hands.
Effective hand sanitizers are based on ingredients that were once not as effective as hand sanitizers and other hand sanitizers.
Recently, benzene chloride has been shown to have a long-term post-exercise resistance, unlike acne, which has been shown to decrease yield after repeated use, possibly due to its effects on the skin.
Many people of the lower class cannot afford soap and use ashes or dirt.
Using ashes or soil is another way of doing things that is better than just using water, but it is also less effective than using soap.
One concern is that dust or soil is made up of very small particles that can contaminate and thus increase the spread of the disease rather than slow it down.
Like soap, ash kills contaminated insects by reacting with water to form acid.
If soap is not available, the World Health Organization recommends using ash or sand.
The appropriate hand washing procedures recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent the spread of the disease are as follows:
Wash your hands with cold or hot, running water.
The water in the tank is contaminated and the water temperature is not significantly changed.
Wash your hands with soap, wash your hands with soap, and wash your hands between the hands and under the sink.
Soap is produced from the skin by bacteria that cause disease, and studies have shown that people wash their hands better with soap than with water alone.
Keep your hands down for at least 20 seconds.
Excessive hand-shaking creates a buildup of bacteria, which helps to remove infectious bacteria from the skin, and excess hand-shaking removes the bacteria.
Wash your hands thoroughly with running water.
Putting your hands in the tray can re-contaminate your hands.
Wash your hands with a clean cloth or air-drying cloth.
Dry or well-dried hands can easily re-infection. The most common places to forget are on the thumb, forefinger, between the hands, and even under the fingertips.
Coral or colorful starvation can be a host of germs.
Skin softening oil is recommended for hand sanitization; extremely dry skin can be damaged and increase the risk of spread of the disease.
Other simple techniques can be used to facilitate hand washing when rubber or soap is not available, such as pouring water using a tree-hanging jar (carrot) or a special drainage basin or using dirt when necessary in developing countries. In case of water problems (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), water treatment is available as a carrot and other affordable methods.
Do not look at it is a simple technique that uses a rope-tied jar, feet-washing, handwashing and soap.
Proper hand-washing is a vital part of hand cleaning, but there is still debate about the best way to do so in public.
Many studies show that scrubbing paper is cleaner than electric hand dryers in many private rooms.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London, sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium, conducted a study to compare the levels of hygiene produced by hand sanitizers, hand sanitizers, and hand sanitizers.
After washing and cleaning the hands with a hot air scrubber, the total number of pathogenic bacteria was found to increase by an average of 194% on the palms and the middle of the hands by an average of 254%.
Hand-washing with a ventilator has increased the total number of pathogenic bacteria by an average of 42% on the palms and the middle of the hand by an average of 15%.
After hand washing and scrubbing with custom paper, the total number of bacteria was reduced by an average of 76% on the toothbrush and 77% on the hands. The researchers also conducted a study to determine whether there was contamination between people using the toilet and its surroundings due to each type of scrubbing.
The air conditioner, which was also capable of delivering air at a speed of 180m/s (650km/h; 400mph), could remove contaminants from the hands and other parts and the ability to contaminate other bathers and to release them at a depth of up to 2 meters.
Using a hand sanitizer with hot air can remove germs up to 0.25 meters from the metal.
The paper samples showed a low spread of germs. In 2005, a study by TÃV Produkt und Umwelt examined a variety of hand-washing techniques.
The following changes in the number of infectious bacteria were observed after hand-washing:
Many hand sanitizers are made, and hand sanitizers have been compared to hand sanitizers.
Hand washing with a hand sanitizer is another method of hand washing when traveling without soap or water.
A hand sanitizer must contain at least 60% of the hand sanitizer.
Medical hand washing became legal after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered (in 1846) its importance in preventing illness in hospitals.
Some medical devices remind medical staff to wash their hands if they forget to.
One study showed that using them reduced the incidence of infection.
Clinical hand washing takes at least 15 seconds, with plenty of soap and water or a special fluid and rubs both hands together.
The hands must be tied together in a very close fashion.
If there is dirt under the roof, the disposable soap can remove it.
Since hand-washed water is a source of infectious bacteria, it is necessary to wash hands thoroughly and with clean cloth.
After hand washing, a paper scrub should be used to seal the water (and even open the exit door if necessary).
This prevents the hand from becoming contaminated again by the affected area.
Hand washing is recommended for medical purposes to prevent infectious bacteria from spreading.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand washing in hospitals remains a challenge, as a large number of doctors and nurses often forget to wash their hands before touching patients, leading to the spread of infectious bacteria.
A study found that handwashing and other simple procedures can reduce the incidence of blood-borne diseases by 66%. The United Nations Health Organization has published a document on the safe use of handwashing and hand sanitizers in healthcare settings.
A hand sanitizer package can be found on the company's website for comments.
A major reform was undertaken by Whitby and others.
Commercial equipment can test and verify hand hygiene if required to specify requirements and instructions.
The World Health Organization has defined five "times" for hand washing:
after having a blood/ fluid contact
before the treatment, and
After care.Adding disinfectants to soap (soap "medicine" or "microbial") helps wash your hands to kill infectious bacteria.
This method of disinfection may be required before surgery or in areas where antibiotics are highly resistant. To keep the hands healthy before surgery, it is necessary to have a rubber that can be closed and opened without the use of hands, a chlorhexidine or iodine cleanser, a clean hand sanitizer after washing, and a clean hand sanitizer and other clean hand sanitizer.
You must remove all your waistbands.
This procedure involves washing your hands and hands to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
Long handshakes (~10 minutes) are not necessary.
When you wash your hands, keep the water from the hands running back down to the hands.
After washing their hands, remove a clean cloth and put on a surgical garment.
To reduce the number of infections, it is advisable to wash your hands or use handwashing before and after care.
In clinical trials of "staph infectious disease", it was found that the majority of the benefits of hand washing come from the first 20% of washing, and the minor benefits are obtained when hand washing frequency is increased to over 35%.
Washing with ordinary soap yields three times higher rates of foodborne infections than washing with disinfectant soap. Compared to using hand sanitizer and disinfectant soap in 30 seconds, both studies showed that hand sanitizer use reduced disinfection by 26% compared to disinfectant soap.
However, hand washing with soap and water is better than using hand sanitizers to reduce the hand-washing of A/H1N1 and other infected bacteria. Hand washing in hospitals may include teaching staff to wash their hands, adding hand sanitizers and reminding staff in writing and verbally.
More research is needed to demonstrate how effective this aid is in health care in many different areas.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is considered an important and cost-effective way to achieve health and nutrition.
However, the lack of regular access to water, soap, or hand washing equipment in homes, schools, and public places of work is a major challenge that makes it impossible to have a universal hand washing practice.
For example, in many rural parts of Africa, hand washing taps near public or private places are still scarce, although there are other affordable ways to build hand washing facilities.
However, a small number of hand washers can be caused by a habit of not washing hands instead of by a lack of soap or water.
Promoting and encouraging handwashing with soap can have a profound effect on action, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing and drive long-term societal change.
To do this effectively, monitoring and evaluation are essential.
A review of 70 studies found a community-based approach to increasing handwashing in LMICs while promoting non-productive social media activities. One example is the promotion of school handwashing as a "Three-Star Method" by UNICEF by encouraging schools to use a simple, low-cost method to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, and other hygiene tools.
If the basic criteria are met, the school can go from one to three stars.
Building a community handwashing facility can be one of the most sustainable ways to promote handwashing practices in order to reduce childhood illness and death.
International Handwashing Day is another example of a campaign to encourage people to wash their hands in order to achieve the goal of behavioural change. In response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has promoted the handwash emoji.
Few studies have shown the overall efficacy of hand washing in developing countries compared to the DALYs.
However, one study shows that the development of handwashing with soap was more productive than other water and sanitation practices.
The importance of hand washing in human life; in particular, for vulnerable people such as newborns or soldiers injured in battle in hospital, was demonstrated in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis of Vienna, Austria and Florence Nightingale, an Englishwoman "who introduced a new approach to nursing".
At that time, many people still thought that infectious diseases were caused by bad smells called parasites.
In the 1980s, foodborne and medical-related infections led the CDC to intensify its efforts to raise awareness of hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of disease.
The 2009 swine flu pandemic and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have increased national understanding of the importance of handwashing with soap to prevent the spread of these infectious diseases.
For example, large inscriptions on "the best way to wash your hands" are hung next to hand washing machines in public spaces of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The word "washing hands" on something refers to a person's unwillingness to acknowledge his actions or to acknowledge any conspiracy in the process.
It comes from the Bible Book of Matthew where Pontius Pilate washed his hands after deciding to crucify Jesus Christ, but the phrase remains commonly used in English-speaking countries.
In Shakespeare's play Macbeth, Mademoiselle Macbeth began washing her hands to remove the stain she thought she had, indicating that her heart was pounding her for her sins and the actions she had caused her husband to commit.
It has been found that people, after having improper memories or thoughts of doing something, tend to wash their hands more often than others, and value handwashing equipment more than others.
And those who are allowed to wash their hands after considering such abusive practices tend to avoid further repentant "cleansing" activities such as voluntary activities.
Hand washing is a religious practice, consisting of washing hands with just water without soap and hand washing, that is part of the practice of many different religions, including the BahÃ¡'Ã­, Hindu, Assyrian, and Taoist religions, Judaism, Rabbis, and Wudu Islam. Religions also require their members to wash their hands, especially after performing special rituals.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam prescribe hand washing after going out of the closet.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam teach that people wash their hands before and after eating.
Measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in the workplace
COVID-19 prevention measures at work are essential to ensure safety and health at work in order to prevent the 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19).
Effective workplace epidemiological measures are determined by the workplace and workplace, based on the risk of disease, the prevalence of disease in the community and the risk of COVID-19 infection for vulnerable individual workers.
According to the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk work is work where employees are in close contact with people and other employees, where basic precautions for infection are enforced, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home when they are sick, guidelines for respiratory infections and regular hygiene and injecting pesticides into the workplace.
An occupational risk of viral infection is a occupational risk that involves frequent contact with or contact with people who are unknown or suspected of being infected with COVID-19, but who may have been infected by contagion or travel abroad.
There are general social workers such as school staff, public sector employees and large customer service stores.
The pandemic response for these workers is in addition to basic disease control guidelines, including adequate ventilation through air circulators, protective equipment when you are exposed and protective clothing designed in case of contact with someone infected with COVID-19.
OSHA recommends that healthcare and recreational workers who have encountered or suspected COVID-19 infection are at higher risk of infection, which increases the risk when these workers perform respiratory enhancement activities, take or test for a known or suspected COVID-19 infection.
The best possible outbreak response for these workers is the use of specialized equipment such as airtight rooms and protective clothing designed for their workplace.
The COVID-19 pandemic can have a profound impact on the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work because of illness, needing to care for others, or fear of being infected.
The nature of the business may change, whether in terms of how goods are imported or how goods are purchased (e.g. purchasing goods in less expensive hours or services of handling or delivery by car).
Subsequently, the shipment of goods from areas affected by the COVID-19 pandemic may be discouraged.
Risk plans cover the many occupational and occupational risks, including potential infectious risks, home and community risks and the risks to employees themselves due to ageing or chronic illness.
They set out the necessary guidelines for disease control to eliminate these risks and other measures that could be taken in the event of a failure during the pandemic.
Infectious disease preparedness and control programmes can be implemented at national or regional level.
Measures to control the epidemic in particular individuals include reducing contagion between workers, protecting people at high risk from other diseases, maintaining open business and reducing the impact on other industries in processing and processing operations.
The prevalence of the disease in the private sector may affect the measures taken.
The most widely used series of epidemiological measures to combat the pandemic is to ensure the safety and health of the workplace according to the results it produces.
Where it is not possible to control the COVID-19 pandemic, the most effective way to combat the pandemic is to use dedicated tools, followed by dedicated management measures and protective clothing.
Anti-infection with dedicated tools is to protect workers from work-related risks without compromising on employee behavior and can be cost effective in implementing them.
A management policy is a change in the workplace or functional policies that requires them to be implemented by an employee or employer.
Personal protective clothing (PPE) is considered to be less productive than the previous two clothing items, but may help prevent contamination.
All types of PPE must be selected based on the risk of the employee, appropriate to the work performed (e.g. respiration), regular and appropriate wear, regular inspection, proper handling, and appropriate modification and removal, cleaning, storage or disposal to prevent contamination.
According to the US OSHA, low-risk occupations are occupations that are highly vulnerable to infection by individuals or coworkers.
Basic prevention measures must be observed throughout the workplace and include frequent hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home when they are sick, respiratory health prevention guidelines including covering up when urinating or sneezing, providing clean and spacious spaces, organizing a technological exchange, preventing substitute workers from entering or leaving work if necessary, prohibiting simultaneous use of colleagues' equipment and cleaning and frequent use of pesticides in the workplace.
Immediate identification and quarantine of potentially infected individuals is an important step in protecting employees, customers, visitors, and others at work.
The CDC in the United States requires workers with severe respiratory illness to stay at home until no more fever, signs of fever and other symptoms occur for at least 24 hours without the use of fire suppressants or other symptomatic medications and to simplify procedures for applying for sick leave, allowing employees to stay at home to a sick family member and informing employees of these measures.
For OSHA, a work with a risk-weighted exposure to a virus is a work that requires frequent contact or contact within a distance of less than 1.8 m with people who are not known or suspected of being infected with COVID-19, but who may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to contagion between people in a commercial setting or because people have recently travelled to a COVID-19-infected area.
There are frequent contact with the general public such as school workers, public works and public transportation.Infection control measures are targeted at these workers and other high-risk groups, including air conditioners, increased air conditioners, and the establishment of safety indicators for plastic surgeons and mobile safety guidelines for customers who are not leaving the vehicle.Infection control measures are targeted at these workers and other high-risk groups, including air conditioners, increased air conditioning, and increased safety indicators, including the use of plastic surgeons, preventing the surge of workers and setting up of mobile safety guidelines for customers who are not leaving the vehicle.Infection control measures are targeted at these workers and other high-risk groups of workers, including preventing the spread of COVID-19 virus, preventing the spread of disease to workers who are at risk of illness, changing the number of air conditioners, and preventing the use of electronic safety guidelines for workers who are using plastic surgeons, preventing the use of mobile devices and protecting against the spread of COVID-19, preventing the spread of new infections, and increasing the use of electronic devices and other technologies to prevent the spread of COVID-19 virus, and preventing the spread of COVID-19 infections.
Employees in this risk group are less required to use respirators.
When a patient is on board, appropriate safeguards should be taken to protect the crew and other passengers, including isolating the patient from others and remaining within 2 metres of each other, providing a single flight attendant with the patient's needs, providing a mask or requiring him to cover his mouth and nose with a cloth when he is coughing or sneezing.
Aircrew must wear medical gloves that are used after assisting a patient on board or touching a body fluid or working in potentially contaminated areas and wear protective clothing when necessary if the patient is on board with a fire, cough or shortness of breath.
Towels and other disposable items must be placed in a special container and contaminated areas must be cleaned and disinfected after use. On passenger ships, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, the virus control includes postponing travel when a patient is ill and quarantining and informing the ship's hospital immediately if there is a fire or other symptoms on board.
In schools and nursing homes, the CDC requires temporary detention for cleaning or disinfection when an infected person appears in a school building without regard to the infection of another person.
Although there is a small or large number of contagious interactions, avoidance measures can be applied to stop the movement of people and gatherings such as physical exercises or choral singing lessons or dining in a cafeteria, increasing the space between chairs and other places, leaving room for entrance and exit, avoiding unnecessary visits and using a clinic for children with symptoms similar to those of influenza.
If there is a community-based infection, other than long-term closure precautions can be considered.For security personnel who work on a daily basis, the risk of immediate infection is low, according to the CDC.
Security personnel who have met a person who is confirmed to be infected or suspected of COVID-19 are required to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical personnel, including wearing appropriate protective clothing.
In the event of contact during the arrest, the workers must wipe and disinfect the seatbelts and equipment they wear before reusing them with household detergents or laundry detergents and following the usual instructions for storing and disposing of the special protective clothing used in storing and washing clothes.
OSHA requires that some workers in the health and recreation sectors are at or above the risk of infection.
Occupations with a high risk of infection include medical, laboratory, and medical and residency personnel who may have encountered a known or suspected COVID-19 patient.
These individuals are at higher risk of infection when the occupational therapists engage in activities that include increasing patient ventilation, taking or testing a sample of a person known to be or suspected to be infected with COVID-19.
Dental enhancement activities include oral hygiene, oral hygiene, oral hygiene, some dental procedures and oral examinations or oral tests.
The greatest risk of infection in the restroom is from the body-repair staff who are known or suspected of being infected with COVID-19 at the time of death; they are at a higher risk when conducting a test to determine the cause of death. And the control of infection with dedicated equipment includes risk groups including isolation rooms for patients known or suspected of being infected with COVID-19, including the conduct of patient ventilation activities.
A special ventilator may be suitable for some doctors working on holiday.
The doses must be taken in accordance with the Level 3 health safety guidelines.
WHO requires hospitalized patients to be quarantined for suspected COVID-19 status. And whether it is a specific protective suit, OSHA requires the use of respirators for those working within a 2-meter radius of known or suspected illness, infected with SARS-CoV-2 and performing ventilation activities.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved respirators of N95 or higher should be used according to a proper, prescribed safety regimen using respirators including appropriate wear checks, dress recommendations and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can protect the wearer better and make the worker feel more comfortable. WHO does not require workers to wear clothes because COVID-19 is a respiratory illness rather than a communicable disease through the body's urinary tract.
WHO recommends that medical masks only be worn by hospitality workers.
For breathing room testers, caregivers, or carriers of COVID-19 patients who do not have respiratory enhancement, WHO recommends that they wear a medical mask, lights or helmets, a vest and towels.
When an oxygenation procedure is performed, the medical mask is replaced with N95 or FFP2 respirators.
Given that the global elimination of personal protective clothing (PPE) is insufficient, WHO calls for reducing the need for personal protective clothing for the use of medical devices, establishing barriers to collecting such as contact lenses, and allowing direct medical care providers to access the COVID-19 patient's room only, using PPE only when necessary for specific purposes, maintaining the use of a single respirator while treating multiple patients with the same disease, monitoring and coordinating the processing and management of PPE and prohibiting the use of a single cover for patients with no symptoms.

DECISION: [Covid-19] Reducing burden and preparing for the future
The date and time of the event: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
CC0: No exclusive copyright
We are in a very special time this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic is a clear indication that the world has become a village and that we need to help each other.
We have never faced these challenges, but we know that to cope with the pandemic in a positive way is to understand the global challenges, to work together and to stay united in this community.
The kindness and attention we have received from all our coworkers through email, phone calls and chat is an expression of the unique personality we have had the privilege of working with you extensively.
I have no way of expressing my gratitude or of expressing my pride in you all as fellow workers.
Last week, someone told me how much he appreciated our work.
It reminded me of the increasing use of Wikipedia around the world today, which is a strong indication that it is a useful information platform and should remain online and accessible to all.
Your job makes it possible, whether it's maintaining the website, paying our coworkers, or keeping our workplace safe.
The world needs Wikipedia's information more than ever.
This is the time not only to look at what we do but also to see how we do it, which will bring about a meaningful change in the world.
Given the importance of this role and your role, we will make the necessary changes to how we work, starting next week.
Making changes in our actions is our time
As Robyn said, our group met last night to discuss our future and our future.
In that interview, we discussed what we thought would be the right answer to what we are facing and the best way to keep a family going in these times.
In a special way, we wanted to remove obstacles and uphold our responsibilities for a long time.
If you want to call, it's okay.
To those who are employees and to those who are under contract:
the average daily work hours are 4 or 20 hours per week until further notice.
We cannot call it a holiday; if you can work regular hours, we can use it in our assignments.
But today, the world is changing and you need to care for your loved ones, buy food, or go out; your health is your priority.
We're not monitoring your work schedule.
If you are sick, do not go to work.
It is not mentioned but emphasized.
You do not need to request sick leave or paid leave, you should inform your manager and help your team to review the schedule in a timely manner so that the main work is carried out.
(If your test results show you have COVID-19, notify Bryan of T&amp;C Ops so that T&amp;C can provide you with appropriate care and support for your problem.)
Those who are paid an hour will be paid full.
We revisited this and were again determined to fulfill our obligations to our hourly wage earners.
Each will be paid according to the exact hours worked in normal times.
Sometimes you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we are here for you.
Many people use work as a way to overcome the stresses of this world.
Our actions can be especially valuable in these times.
The goal is to take care of yourself.
Our meeting is to talk to your supervisor, to find out what to expect and to make the necessary changes.
Some work is taken seriously.
There are things we should keep doing.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust &amp; Safety teams are established to raise funds (and others) for critical work requiring additional support.
We will begin a review of all branches to review the objectives and change our focus to support the main areas of our responsibility.
There are important things we all have to do, but there are important things we need to focus on.
Doing little now will have no effect.
We do not plan to work almost twice to recover when we lost out after the pandemic.
You are not expected to work overtime to keep your time running because it is not possible now.
We accept that things have changed and will work to set new goals and opportunities where appropriate.
What will happen to the annual plan?
To adapt to the current state of the workplace, we would like to change the 2020-2021 Agenda.
Our goal is to extend the 2019-2020 planning period to allow time to budget by encouraging employees to focus on primary work, self-care and care for loved ones while supporting those who are looking for or are willing to work part-time in the coming weeks.
Such extended hours greatly reduce the work planned for the entire family.
We will submit our proposal to the Governing Board next week and will provide further information to the other representatives and teams on the following instructions as soon as possible once they are approved.
The planning team has been successful in demonstrating leadership skills.
Physical conditions, infectious and hygienic conditions
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues working in SF met someone who may have been infected with the COVID-19 virus.
But with great care, we hired a virus-controlled hygiene team to develop a pesticide throughout the San Francisco office.
They have used a hospital-level antivirus system to kill outbreaks everywhere, from the entrance to the bank's sensors to the floor where we work.
The building is implementing anti-virus guidelines using user safety equipment.
We are confident that the office will be well prepared if we decide to repeat it.
Our DC office in WeWork, has shared its COVID-19 anti-virus protocol with us and all employees working in DC.
Until last week, our DC office has been fully operational with remote controls to comply with San Francisco's guidelines.
As some of my colleagues in NYC know, we had begun negotiations for a rental in Brooklyn.
The discussion continues, but it may be delayed.
Some of my colleagues would work remotely for the first time.
Our remote colleagues know that this is a viable option and we would like to advise:
Reduce the length of a meeting from one hour to two hours if it is delayed.
If sessions are no longer needed, consider how to reduce the number of days you study.
Clearly explain the advice, have a clear text of the study and submit the documents in advance.
Make video a priority with apps like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate interaction and instant data sharing.
The Director-General shall be the presiding officer of each meeting, with a person responsible for the discussion and questioning and a list of speakers and a person who takes the floor (or co-writes the floor).
Email technical support when you need a good computer.
Eating simple meals to maintain good health.
Go to the Slack #remoties channel to discuss the challenges you face in doing your job
The work of the Staff Working Group reviews online training trends in order to attract support and increase the workload within the Group.
Last week, we asked all fundraising organizations to suspend public campaigns to fund Wikimedia as a training platform for new online writers, until the WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We have told them that requiring them to stop and follow other directions makes it very difficult to complete their dedicated fundraising efforts and that no one will punish them for delaying or changing their goals.
Next week, we will follow up on more instructions on Wikimania and other special regional conferences in certain areas.
The general perception of global organizations is that there is pain in the cessation of activities but there is comfort, understanding and the ability to focus on their own organizations, Wikimedia and others.
CRT is therefore creating a page on Meta-Wiki to provide the community with the opportunity to monitor the impact and the information we share.
Keeping up with COVID-19 issues
We will send an invitation to your calendar next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We will use this opportunity to share with you the latest news, answer any questions you may have and spend additional time with you.
We are all involved in this pandemic and we are there to cooperate as much as possible.
In the meantime, you can continue to access the information contained in this email and other relevant information about COVID-19 at the Wiki Office.
CRT will keep these pages updated and all information will be in one place.
We are also looking for ways to maintain communication with workers living in countries currently affected by the pandemic.
If you have any questions about travel, activities, operations or internet issues or any other issues that you need help with, please do not hesitate to contact us and contact CRT.
We are here to help you coordinate activities as needed.
If you have a confidential or urgent issue, please email Bryan Judan, Global Chief Operating Officer.
None of these changes should be seen as a departure from our job or responsibilities.
Rather, it is a demonstration that our current occupations and responsibilities are likely to change in an unprecedented way.
These are the steps we believe are necessary to help each other to continue working, carrying out our tasks according to the needs of the assistance and providing the world with a viable service.
The work we had planned will still be waiting for us until the time comes.
We are currently in a position to help each other and find time to do important work in the weeks ahead and possibly in the months ahead.
We need you all to make this happen and we need you to take care of yourself and your families to be healthy when needed.
Now you should wash your hands and not touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and all other members of the Management Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
b Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a protein that binds to the outer membrane (tissues of the liver), blood vessels, heart, kidney, and intestinal tissues.
ACE2 directly modulates the action of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the angiotensin-II content and increasing Ang(1-7) to a reliable drug for the treatment of heart disease.ACE2 also acts as a neurotransmitter for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the protein encoded by this gene is commonly referred to as hACE2.
The protein encoded by angiotensin-con 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of the endothelial membrane and other tissues.
The ACE2 protein contains the N-terminal part of peptidase M2 and the C-terminal collectrin part that carries renal acid.
ACE2 is a single-stranded protein subunit of type I, with its protein-activated subunit on the surface of the pulmonary and other cells.
The outer layer of ACE2 is separated from the membrane by a membrane-containing protein known as sheddase, and the resulting membrane protein enters the membrane and then exits the membrane.
ACE2 is found in many tissues: ACE2 is involved in the regulation of cell growth primarily in type II lung muscle cells, small intestine cells, blood vessel cells and blood vessels and in the thin tissue cells of many tissues.
ACE2 mRNA expression is found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and cortex.
The primary function of ACE2 is to set the correct ACE.
ACE is secreted by angiotensin I cells where angiotensin II is involved in reducing blood pressure.
ACE2 also produces carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses from angiotensin in the major blood vessel (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also break down into peptides such as [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also activates the active amino acid cyclic acid SLC6A19 and plays a role in the development of Hartnup's disease-causing protein immunity.
As a transcriptional protein, ACE2 acts as a key gateway to the cell that divides certain coronaviruses, namely HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (SARS-causing virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19-causing virus).
More specifically, the association of the uptake of the S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the ACE2 protein segment in cells provides a mechanism for endocytosis and transfer of these viruses from the host cell to the cell membrane.
This entry system also prepares protein S to interact with TMPRSS2 cleavage, and research is looking at how to inhibit its activity as a key treatment. This has led to the suggestion that reducing ACE2 levels in cells may help to combat the disease.
However, many professional companies and regulatory agencies have called for the continuation of the procedure to prevent ACE from acting at an approved dose and administering ARB.
A recent review and extensive review published on July 11, 2012, found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a 34% decrease in the risk of developing epilepsy compared to the control subjects".
Furthermore, "the risk of infection with polio has been reduced in patients at high risk of infection treated with ACE inhibitors, especially in patients with heart failure, and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a decrease in tuberculosis deaths, although the results were not significantly higher than the overall risk of tuberculosis infection".
ACE2 (rhACE2) is widely considered the newest treatment for acute lung injury and appears to improve blood flow to the lungs and increase oxygenation to areas affected by the bacterial infection of the lungs.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is 10 hours and it starts to work 30 minutes later than when the effects of the reaction begin to appear (when) within 24 hours.
Several studies have found that rhACE2 may be a reliable treatment for patients with renin-angiotensin-disrupting disorders (RAS-disrupting drugs) or for patients with high blood angiotensin II levels.
COVID-19 is a mobile application designed to help identify contacts in search of answers to the 2019-20 coronavirus outbreak, for example through a identification process ("number") that may have contacted an infected person.
Many programs have been developed or are requested by the public, with the support of governments in some states and territories under their control.
Many areas of application-based interaction have been developed.
Concerns about the encryption of personal data have been raised, especially in the context of location-based systems for users of applications.
Another less intrusive alternative to this is using a Bluetooth data exchange to access and identify other mobile phones using a nearby app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would be integrating the application to support applications based on the Bluetoothigah newsletter immediately installed on Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Government of China, in cooperation with Alipay, has rolled out a program that allows citizens to contact people with COVID-19.
It is used in over 200 cities across China. In Singapore, the TraceTogether app is currently in use.
The application, developed by a large community of IT and Communications professionals, was released as an open source and publicly available news source. North Macedonia has released "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-enabled application to detect the presence of highly infected people and provide a prompt response to health authorities.
The programme was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is expected to be available on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government said that the interactive program had reached its highest level and should have been available for distribution in the coming weeks.
Australia and New Zealand are considering developing mobile apps based on the Singaporean TraceTogether and the Russian BlueTrace apps. Russia plans to launch a mobile app that will not exceed the maximum number of COVID-19 patients living in Moscow, making sure they are not leaving their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security implementation at the University of Cambridge, has listed a number of issues that are faced by mobile application-based systems, including the fact that they are sick and healthy and that they do not actually do what they are set up to if the use of these applications is limited to a small population.
To address these concerns about the spread of these deceptive or malicious coronavirus-controlled apps, Apple has set a limit on the types of apps that households can access from the App Store, allowing only "publicly licensed" or otherwise trusted apps.
Google and Amazon have also set up similar restrictions.
Individuals have expressed concerns about mass surveillance via mobile technology, in particular whether the measures in place to control the coronavirus outbreak will be eliminated when the pandemic is over.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have published a document calling for the use of the current restricted control system.
These organizations have announced eight government policies for their projects:
The inspection shall be lawful, necessary and proportionate to the purpose of the inspection.'
the extension of the period of review and review shall include articles specifying the period of expiry;
the data should only be used for COVID-19-related purposes;
security is the confidentiality of information that must be protected and disclosed to be protected on the basis of evidence;
the control using technology must be non-discriminatory;
any communication must be legally binding;
There should be a system to combat and prevent violence;
"a substantive involvement of each partner is required, including public health professionals and groups of people left behind The German Institute of Technology (CCC) and Reporters without Borders (RSF) also have a list to be taken care of which are also being deliberately identified.
A Google/Apple initiative to address the issue of persistent surveillance decides to remove the search for infected individuals from their network when such a system is no longer needed.
Some countries have used the search engine to locate infected individuals using local navigation rather than mobile technology, eliminating the need for mobile technology and the ability to avoid searching.
In Israel, a screening-based detection method has been approved.
A search engine-based detection system with access to personal data about the location has serious privacy concerns.
However, not all data storage systems are technically automated but require access to personal data related to location; there are many systems that are designed to ensure the privacy of data users using a database only when data needs to be transferred (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-telephone system has been used to track the cases.
Instead of using dedicated mobile technology, data was collected using a variety of methods including mobile phone usage, credit card activity and notification of people with serious infectious issues via text messages on their phones.
In addition to using this information to inform the infected, the government has also established a public access to local data, which was made possible by changes in privacy laws following the MERS outbreak in the country.
This information is available to anyone using a variety of mobile technologies and websites. Countries including Germany have adopted both national and international methods despite the availability of personal information.
As of April 6, 2020, no further information has been released.
The detection methodology for infection is based on well-defined personal data, based on reliable data from at least 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than 12 teams of experts investigated possible privacy prevention measures, such as the use of a cloud-based information exchange (BLE) system that allows users to communicate with nearby phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a national and publicly-directed interconnection mechanism and does not operate in a uniform manner. The publicly-directed mechanism includes a data tracking system based on data protection of personal data (DP-PPT), temporary data protection of personal data (TCN), holiday data protection of personal data (CEN), data protection of personal data protection of personal data (PACT) and more.
In this way, the personal data of the individuals identified is not disclosed, and it is about identifying the individuals who were interviewed by the technology.
The privacy team at MIT Media Laboratory is continuing to explore reliable data breach alerts, ways to maintain privacy and use location-based infection tracking to obtain information about the spread of COVID-19.
This is based on a study by Apps Gone Rogue: Protecting Privacy Data released in March 2020. Another proposed approach is Enigma MPC's Encounter Detection, a private data privacy technology development company, also developed by MIT Media Laboratory.
A reliable tracking method uses digital technologies to help users communicate health and safety information with the authorities without compromising privacy.
On April 5, 2020, a consensus-based and often controversial group of people established the International TCN Forum, which aims to pool and facilitate global communication on the use of mobile technology to track out the infected, thus providing a broad range of opportunities.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had established a new system for identifying those infected using state-owned technology.
On April 10, 2020, Android and iOS mobile technology control companies Google and Apple announced their newly launched Infected Tracking System, a system that they claimed to be in compliance with privacy policies, based on the integration of a cloud-based technology known as Bluetooth Low Energy with other computer systems that keep personal information private.
They also announced the technology's role in the program.
Google and Apple announce that the system is intended for use in three phases:
Collecting resources to help the government develop a technology that respects privacy standards to help it track cases of infection
The implementation of the technology in iOS and Android devices is planned to be launched by Google and Apple to address the regulatory challenges of first implementing the technology in other existing technologies, and then removing the technology after the pandemic.
Drug repurposing, re-profiling, re-tasking or therapeutic switching in English is the process of taking a prescription drug to treat a specific disease and using it to treat a different or different disease.

Lopinavir/ritonavir has been included in the WHO World Testing List of Medicines to be Used
Remdesivir was developed by Gilead Sciences, which is dedicated to the treatment of Ebola and Marburg virus outbreaks. Gilead Sciences also discovered that Remdesivir can fight viruses that do not enter the cell, including viruses that can be transmitted, respiratory, neurodegenerative, and coronaviruses.
A common problem in treating viral diseases is the ability to ignore medications as they gradually change their shape and make the disease more severe and infectious.
Recent studies suggest that remdesivir may have a strong immune response. Several studies are still underway, including two by the University of Clevaland Hospital; one is for patients with chronic illness and one is for emergency treatment.

The COVID-19 vaccine is a proposed vaccine for the 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine is available, a number of studies are underway to determine the outcome of the vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that there was no vaccine expected for SARS-CoV-2, the virus's cause, before 18 months.
Five vaccines were still in Phase I trials in April.
COVID-19 was reported in December 2019.
It began to spread worldwide in 2020, resulting in high costs and a successful vaccine research campaign.
Many of the companies are currently using traditional medicines that are already in the process of developing a vaccine that can fight SARS-CoV-2.
As of April, CEPI's focus on vaccine development is speed, capacity to produce, recruit, and worldwide delivery.
In April, CEPI experts announced that 10 different technologies are being researched and developed in early 2020 to develop a vaccine that is effective against COVID-19.
The current Phase I research process includes:
The DNA and RNA of the blood cells in phase I of vaccine research are: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral cells (stage I of vaccine research: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
According to CEPI experts in April, approximately 115 vaccine studies are still underway, including 78 confirmed that projects have begun (79, according to Milken), and 37 announced, but the data is not yet clear (there are suspected plans or ongoing development).
The I-II level test measures accuracy and efficiency, is generally performed, closely monitored, and performed in multiple settings, where error is avoided, and to identify a suitable dose.
Phase III trials involve a large group of participants, including a control group, and a trial of the immunity of the vaccine, with the evaluation of whether the other side effects of the vaccine are reduced to tolerance.
Of the 79 vaccines currently under development (approved in early April 2020), 74 had not yet been tested in humans (still undergoing basic research).
On 24 January 2020, the University of Quensland in Australia announced that it was conducting research on a vaccine that could alter the structure of viral cells to help the body's immune system function.

In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry, and three universities collected data to access IBM's unique computers, as well as other computer technology products from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have different types of side effects, often called unknown effects.
This means that they can have a positive effect on immune systems.
Another Australian trial is looking for 4,170 physicians to help.
Vaccines that are being developed may be incomplete or ineffective.
Recent studies of vaccine efficacy with selected COVID-19 strains, such as ACE2 mice and monkeys, suggest a need for Level 3 hygiene measures to address the virus and international cooperation to comply with hygiene guidelines.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on animals.
As of 2020, no vaccine or vaccine for SARS and MERS has been shown to be safe and effective in the human body.
According to a 2005-2006 study, the discovery and development of SARS vaccines and vaccines was an urgent need in government and healthcare systems worldwide.
At the time of the MERS outbreak, it was expected that the research being conducted could provide a practical approach to vaccine and vaccine development for the MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, one MERS (DNA-based) vaccine had completed Phase I human trials, and three others were under development, all of which were viral, two of the Adenoviridae (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) virus family, and one of the MVA (MVA-MERS-S) family.
Social media has spread rumors that COVID-19 was already known and that its vaccine was available.
The social media reports are about the presence of cells and vaccines for other coronavirus problems such as SARS coronavirus.
The 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the respiratory virus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, diarrhea, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms of this disease include fatigue, nerve pain, nausea, sore throat, loss of breathing ability and sense of smell, and stomach pain.
The symptoms of the infection occur within five days but may last between two and fourteen days.
While most of the people infected with the virus show mild symptoms, some have difficulty breathing and many of the body's weak organs are sensitive.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million people had been infected in 210 countries, resulting in approximately 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is transmitted through contact, often through the flow of fluids that comes from coughing, sneezing, or talking.
When these fluids are released by inhalation, they usually fall to the ground or onto an object rather than infecting a person at a large distance.
People can also become infected by contact with the virus and then contact with the face, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive outside for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after symptoms, although it can also be contagious before symptoms appear and during infection.The most reliable method of detection is the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), which is performed using nasal samples.
It is essential that a suspected infection is treated with a mask.
The rules for wearing a mask for all people vary, with some officials advising people not to wear it, while others are demanding that people wear it.
There is currently no known vaccine or specific treatment for COVID-19.
There has been a case of a communicable disease in all six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may not have symptoms or show flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Severe symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or burden, facial cramps, inability to walk, redness of the face or lips; it is recommended to seek immediate medical attention when these symptoms appear.
It is not uncommon to experience symptoms that include respiratory problems such as sweating, itching, or sore throat.
Signs of a high-risk pregnancy such as vomiting, jumping, and diarrhea are commonly seen on the upper lip.
Patients in China first reported symptoms of chest congestion and cardiac arrest.
In some cases, the disease can be severe to the point of respiratory failure, the functioning of many organs, and even death.
This is called the manifestation of disease.
The duration of the COVID-19 outbreak is usually six days but can range from 2 to 14 days.
97.5% of people show symptoms at this time, which can be up to 11.5 days after infection.
The role of non-symptomatic infections is still unknown; however, the main information is that they can infect others.
The number of non-symptomatic cases is currently unknown but is being studied, based on data from the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) that 20% of all cases are expected to be hospitalized with no symptoms.
The National Health Commission of China on April 1 began reporting the cases on daily infection statistics; of the 166 reported cases on that day, 130 (78%) were symptomatic when tested.
The production of strawberries can carry large amounts of viruses.
Speaking too much causes more fluid to flow than speaking slowly.
A study in Singapore found that coughing uncovered on the mouth can cause a flow of water up to 4.5 metres (15 feet) in depth.
Although the virus is airborne, the National Science Foundation says it is possible and that air from separate collected cells was tested for virus.
Medical procedures such as coughing and respiratory enhancement (CPR) can cause air to leak and potentially cause infection.
While there is some question as to whether a mother can infect a fetus, there is little evidence. The virus can be transmitted when people show symptoms; if there is little chance of infection before symptoms appear.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) reports that although the ease of transmission of the virus is not yet known, it can infect between two and three people.
In particular, the virus lasted one day on the board, up to three days on polypropylene and solid metals (AISI 304), and four hours on 99% stability metals.
However, this may change due to cold and heat.
Soap and insecticides, when used properly, can kill viruses; soap can damage the immune system, inhibiting and even removing the virus from the body or the environment.
Other uses include benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a pesticide), but it is not very effective. In a Hong Kong study, a test was performed within 2 days of hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first test tested positive for a large amount of viral load, and the sixth tested positive for a large amount of viral load in the second day of testing.
The serious coronavirus outbreak 2 SARS-CoV-2 is a novel respiratory infection virus, first identified in Wuhan in three patients with respiratory problems related to respiratory illnesses.
All the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are expressed in the coronavirus variant.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which kills the viral immunity. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the earlier SARS-CoV.
COVID-19 is particularly common in the lungs, as the virus passes through the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is abundant in the lungs.
The virus uses its backbone called the spike (horn-shaped protein) to bind to ACE2 and enter the organism.
12% of cases of infection and hospitalization in Wuhanm, China, are diagnosed with severe heart problems and this is common in serious illnesses.
The incidence of cardiovascular disease is high, with inflammation and immune deficiency occurring as the disease progresses, but cardiovascular disease may be associated with an ACE2 receptor infection.
ACE2 virus is rapidly transmitted to the heart and is involved in cardiac function.
Patients in the ICU infected with COVID-19 reported problems with impaired blood flow (31%) and impaired blood vessel circulation (25%), which were associated with a low chance of recovery. Tests in COVID-19 deaths showed impaired respiratory tract (DAD), as well as lung tissue.
Although SARS-COV-2 may be ACE2-resistant in the body and in the respiratory system, COVID-19 patients have shown signs of severe inflammation.
In particular, T cells produced by GM-CSF disease have been shown to interact with IL-6-causing inflammation in COVID-19 patients.
The test revealed immune cells in the body of the virus victim.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced several testing methods for the epidemic.
The most reliable method of detecting infection is known as the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) .
The test samples were taken from the respiratory tract using nasal passages; however, a nasal swab and a nasal swab may also be used.
The answers can be found in a matter of hours to two days.
Blood tests may be performed, but two blood tests are required to be administered within two weeks and results are insignificant immediately.
Chinese scientists have managed to isolate coronavirus cells and release laboratory results worldwide to enable the free-form production of PCR cells to be used to test for viral infection.
As of April 4, 2020, tests were being conducted on bodyguards (which may indicate a persistent infection or a previous infection), but were not expected for widespread use.
Chinese experimental testing has shown a 60% to 70% efficiency.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a testing site on March 21, 2020 to be operational by the end of the month.Testing guidelines issued by Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital have defined a method of testing infections based on clinical evidence and even on epidemiological outcomes.
Initially, infection is usually caused by the secretion of viral cells, which accumulate, separate from the body into which they enter and then spread widely.
As the epidemic progresses, it spreads through the respiratory tract, creating pathways (developing the respiratory tract through closure of the respiratory tract) and forming a cluster.
There is little information about the microscopic imaging and the nature of COVID-19.
The following are the results of viral analysis of the body:
Visual features: inflammation of the respiratory tract, inflammation of the surrounding heart, closure of the respiratory tract
There are three main types of viral cognitive impairment:
Minor respiratory failure: fluid-filled cells in the lungs, growth of respiratory tract cells, abnormal respiratory tumors, inflammation of the cells and the formation of multiple cells
acute adverse events: the spread of airway damage (DAD) and the spread of the infection.
DAD is responsible for severe respiratory distress disorders (ARDS) and blood vessel blockages.
Respiratory diseases are more easily started: accumulation of fluid in the respiratory tract and lungs
Blood: internal blood clotting (DIC); formation of new blood cells
Measures to reduce the spread of  infection include staying at home, avoiding public spaces, frequent hand washing with soap and water and doing so for at least 20 seconds, cleaning the respiratory tract and avoiding touching face, nose or mouth without washing hands.
The CDC recommends that people cover their mouths with a clean cloth when they are coughing or sneezing or apply the forearm when there is no cloth.
Washing your hands is essential every time you cough or sweat.
The CDC recommends that people wear masks when they leave their homes to prevent the spread of the infection by people who do not show symptoms. The goal of the interventions is to reduce the number of people who are infected with the virus by closing schools, working places, banning travel and restricting gatherings.
The instructions say that people should be within 6 feet of each other by 1.8 feet.
There is no known cure for COVID-19. As the vaccine is expected to be available in 2021, the best way to combat the pandemic is to develop a new COVID-19 infection reduction strategy known as "flattening the curve" in English.
The CDC recommends frequent hand washing with soap and water and should be done for at least 20 seconds, especially after leaving the toilet or when hands are exposed to contamination, before eating, after breathing, coughing or sweating.
The CDC also recommends that people use a dedicated pesticide with a 60% chance of infection, which is used when there is no water or soap available.
This class of drugs contains a disinfectant known as ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is an insecticide; it is not a "hand remedy".
Glycerol is also added to the prescription medication.
People are treated with a variety of methods, including sewage treatment, ventilation, and other infectious tissue enhancement.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is warning people suspected of infection to wear a mask.
The ECMO has continued to be used to address the issue of respiratory failure and is still being valued.
People are encouraged to maintain hygiene, health care, and a healthy diet to increase their immune system.
Alternative therapeutic measures can be used for people with mild symptoms of infection that are still present. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have announced the quality of care for hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
The US Department of Health and Human Services has collected and published data on the treatment of this disease from various IBCCs.
As of April 2020, there is no known cure for COVID-19.
To treat symptoms, medical experts recommend the use of acetaminophen (paracetamol) as a substitute for ibuprofen in the early days of the disease.
Measures should be taken to reduce the spread of the infection, especially in clinics when performing activities that may release air, such as putting air intakes into respirators or hand-exhausting patients.
The CDC recommends that medical professionals who are caring for COVID-19 patients be placed in a dedicated airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) to continue to comply with the guidelines, avoid contact and wear a mask. The CDC sets out a list of guidelines to be followed in the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) for epidemiological purposes.
The clothing is: PPE, respirator or mask, diapers, and even towels. It is preferable to use respirators, where available, rather than wearing masks.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial use, but FDA has approved medical use of masks (EUA).
It was designed to protect the wearer from airborne contamination as a powder but its ability to prevent viral infection is not well established.
In the absence of face masks, the CDC recommends that people use face masks or, on face masks, personal masks.
Most COVID-19 patients will not be sufficiently satisfied with it to be given breathing supplements or other breathing options, but some will need them.
A clinical study is underway on the types of respiratory enhancers for COVID-19 patients, with the potential to eliminate the use of respiratory pads or other inhalation agents.
It is not known whether the two methods yield the same results per year.
Some doctors prefer to continue using air conditioners when available because this method reduces air pollution compared to the use of respiratory tract. The infection is more common in very elderly people (over 60 years of age, especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries have a problem of poor beds, which raises the issue of coping with the increasing number of patients with COVID-19 who are ill and need hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% were taken to intensive care, 2.3% needed ventilation and 1.4% died.
In China, 30% of COVID-19 patients in hospitals receive ICU care.
The use of air conditioning systems continues to be challenging due to the increasing air pollution caused by COVID-19.
A large number of PEEP devices are needed to help increase patient ventilation to reduce the risk of injury and airway congestion.
The use of these PEEPs is not available in older materials.
Research into a potential treatment for the pandemic began in January 2020, and several treatments have been tested.
Remdesivir is a promising drug.
While it may be until 2021 for new drugs to be developed, several drugs are undergoing regular trials for other conditions or are undergoing regular research.
Antiviral drugs can be administered to patients who are ill.
WHO has invited volunteers to participate in a study to assess the efficacy and safety of the drugs in the trial. The FDA has offered a temporary extension to use enhanced medicines in patients when their health is in apparent danger.
There is no FDA study to confirm the efficacy of this treatment for nausea or vomiting.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to combat the spread of the pandemic.
Users of this method are required to enter their name and ID number.
The technology is capable of detecting the presence of infection in the area of use using control data so that you can get contagious from nearby areas.
Each user of this technology can also view the standings of the other three users.
When Singapore is found to be infected, the technology recommends quarantine, and informs local health authorities. South Korea, Taiwan and other countries use mobile phone account monitoring technology, facial recognition, mobile phone data tracking and human-like data tracking systems to track infected individuals.
In March 2020, the Israeli government gave technology companies the ability to monitor the cell phones of suspected infected individuals.
The decision was made to implement the emergency plan and protect those who may have contact with the infected.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom also launched a mobile data monitoring platform with the support of the Robert Koch Institute, a German government-run institute, to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has developed facial recognition technology to identify those who have violated the strict rules on vaccines.
Italian regional health commissioner Giulo Gallera was told by telephone operators that "about 40% of the population is still on their own".
The German government hosted a 48-hour meeting of more than 42,000 computer scientists.
The President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, called on the world to find ways to combat the spread of the coronavirus.
People may experience extreme depression due to isolation, travel restrictions, medical effects, or fear of the disease itself.
The BBC reported Rory O'Connor's remarks, stating that "isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, over-thinking and poverty have a profound impact on people's mental health and well-being".
The disease may have few or no symptoms, which are similar to other respiratory diseases or influenza.
People with mild illnesses can recover in two steps, while those with mild illnesses can take three to six weeks.
Pregnant women are more likely to be infected with COVID-19 as reported by other viruses, such as SARS and MERS, only COVID-19 infection data in pregnant women is not known. COVID-19 may cause respiratory distress in some people.
Some people infected with COVID-19 may have severe respiratory distress disorders (ARDS) that can lead to respiratory failure, emotional distress and impaired function of various organs.
The complications of COVID-19 include pain throughout the body, blood clotting, and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Bleeding, especially in the dark, was reported in 6% of COVID-19 hospitalized patients, while renal impairment was reported in 4% of patients.
Between 20-30% of COVID-19 patients have reported increased dark cell transaminases.
The report also shows that the time between symptoms and death is ten days, with five of them hospitalized.
However, patients admitted to the ICU spent seven days in hospital before dying.
In a recent case study, the time between symptomatic and death was 14 days, with an average of 6 to 41 days.
According to a study by China's National Health Commission (NHC), the mortality rate for men was 2.8%, while for women it was 1.7%.
Examinations of deaths from pneumonia indicate a deterioration of the pulmonary systemic pulmonary system.
Respiratory problems have shown that the virus is changing.
The lung image appeared to have suffered from severe respiratory problems (ARDS).
In 11,8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, there was a cardiac arrest or cardiac arrest.
According to the March US data, 89% of hospitalized patients had other health problems. Health and social and economic issues may also contribute to mortality.
The mortality rate varies by region but also by the methodology of use.
the lack of attention to the statistics of those with mild symptoms may increase the mortality rate of the disease.
However, the fact that many people die from other causes may cause the mortality rate to be neglected.
Smokers have 1.4 times the severity of COVID-19 and 2.4 times the incidence of illness or death compared to non-smokers.
The Hong Kong Hospital Administration found that between 20% and 30% of the patients' lungs contained water, and medical imaging showed lung damage.
This also means that they should continue to receive care after discharge from the emergency room.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether infection caused long-term post-concussion syndrome among people recovering from the pandemic.
It seems that the protection is effective, based on the nature of other coronavirus, but there are cases of COVID-19 infection after being declared cured of the coronavirus.
These people are likely to be more likely to be infected by the remaining pain in their bodies than they are to be infected a second time.
The disease is suspected to be unproduced and animal-borne, and can be transmitted by organisms.
Its exact origin is unknown, but as of December 2019 it was a communicable disease.
A study of 41 COVID-19 patients, published in January 2020 in the Lancet, revealed symptoms of the disease that began to appear on December 1, 2019.
The WHO officially announced that symptoms of the disease began to appear on December 8, 2019.
Several measures have been taken to count the number of deaths.
These figures vary by region, time and number of doses taken, capacity of healthcare facilities, treatment options, time of onset of the epidemic and population structure including age, gender and overall health.
In late 2019, WHO assigned ICD-10 outbreak code U07.1 to patients laboratory-confirmed to die from SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 code to patients who were COVID-19 positive but not laboratory-confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2.
Based on statistics released by Johns Hopkins University, the global mortality rate was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
Other measures include calculating the CFR, which is the ratio of infectious deaths to infectious disease, and the infectious death rate (IFR), which is the ratio of infectious deaths to infectious deaths (tested and untested).
These figures are not timely and are associated with a specific infected population in order to be taken care of.
If all infected individuals do not immediately begin to develop physical immunity, the appearance of those immunity may provide information on the number of infected individuals.
At the heart of the outbreak was Castiglione d'Adda, a small town of 4,600 inhabitants, where 80 (1.7%) had died.
In Gangelt, the Carnival-era outbreak is spread by young people, causing a decrease in the number of deaths, but the total number of COVID-19 deaths has not been reported.
In addition, the German healthcare sector did not give up.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have a physical defense system, as demonstrated by blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) were reported to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the epidemic and the mortality rate vary for men and women.
The male mortality rate is high; according to studies in China and Italy.
Men in their 50s are at higher risk, with only a difference between men and women in their 90s.
In China, death rates for men were 2.8 percent and for women 1.7 percent.
The reasons for the gender difference are unknown, but may be due to their physical appearance and behavior.
The differences in immune system between men and women, the low smoking rate among women and the prevalence of heart attacks among men at a younger age than women may contribute to the increase in male mortality.
In Europe, 57% of the cases were male and 72% of the deaths from COVID-19 were male.
As of April 2020the US Government had not yet started collecting gender-based data on COVID-19 infections.
Studies of viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women in different ways.
A large number of doctors, especially pharmacists, are women, and they are at higher risk of contracting the virus.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization officially declared the official name of the pandemic as COVID-19".
WHO Director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO is associated with corona, virus VI, disease D, and 19 indicates the first outbreak: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid naming a specific region (e.g. China), species or group of people, in accordance with international naming guidelines to combat stigma or stigma.The COVID-19 virus is the second most common respiratory infectious virus (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus" in official communication.
Both the disease and the two viruses are called "coronavirus".
In Wuhan, China, the virus and the two diseases were called "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO announced 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV as the provisional names of virus and disease in order to comply with the 2015 Convention against the Use of Local Names in the Names of Virus and Disease.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were announced on February 11, 2020.
Due to the limited market capacity, some tech companies are releasing healthcare products such as nasal exams, respirators and respirators.
For example, when a hospital in Italy urgently needed air conditioners and the customer failed to keep time, a local factory quickly produced 100 air conditioners needed in one night.
After the first human case of COVID-19, rumors, misinformation, false information about the origin, origin, development, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease began to be reported and spread rapidly on the Internet.
Viruses can be transmitted to other animals by humans.
Studies have failed to identify the virus genome in pigs, rats and chickens.
There is no proven cure or vaccine.
An international COVID-19 vaccine and vaccine study is being conducted by government agencies, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a "SOLIDARITY Trial" to assess the effects of four commonly prescribed drugs that are suspected to be effective in treating the pandemic.
There is no vaccine, but different companies are testing different vaccines.
Preliminary studies on SARS-CoV SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are used as both use ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
Three vaccines are currently being studied.
First, researchers are working on developing a full vaccine against the virus.
The use of the virus, whether dead or inactive, is intended to stimulate the immune system to detect a new COVID-19 infection.
The second step is to use cell fragments, a technique designed to create a vaccine that allows the immune system to detect the presence of small viral fragments.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the study focuses on the horn-like fat that helps the virus to absorb ACE2 compounds.
The third method is cellular-based (DNA or RNA, a novel vaccine manufacturing method).
The vaccine is currently undergoing clinical trials to assess its safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, four Seattle volunteers began testing the vaccine.
The vaccine contains cells from a potentially pathogenic virus. It has been suggested that the immune system be increased as a viable way to develop the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but there is still a problem.
As of April 2020, more than 300 vaccines were under study.
Seven trials have been conducted on commonly accepted medicines for the treatment of malaria, including four hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
China's research is focusing on a common vaccine for viral diseases, with nine Phase III trials on remdesivir being conducted in several different countries due to a report due out by the end of April.
As of April 2020, there is a continuous testing of COVID-19 vaccines. Many commonly used antiviral drugs are being tested for efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon beta.
As of April 2020, there is evidence of remdesivir's efficacy.
Patients treated with remdesivir have shown improvement.
A Phase III trial is currently underway in the United States, Canada and Italy. Chloroquine, an alternative treatment for malaria, was studied in February 2020, with preliminary results.
Yet, people are invited to do more research like this.
Health authorities in Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a daily intake of one gram, suggests that doubling the amount of wheat can lead to serious health problems and death.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA provisionally approved the secret use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine by COVID-19 patients.
The primary data suggest that large amounts of ribavirin are needed to combat non-invasive SARS-CoV-2.
Nitazoxanide may also be used for viruses that have entered the body after a small amount of SARS-CoV-2 has been identified. The study showed that a precursor fat using the TPRSS2 receptor (TMPRSS2) is needed to allow SARS-CoV-2 to enter through the ACE2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have revealed significant restrictions on the use of the drug without further investigation. Oseltamivir does not expel SARS-CoV-2 without introduction into the body and has no known role in treating COVID-19.
Cytokines can cause problems when COVID-19 is aggravated.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine can inhibit cytokines. The National Health Commission of China has included Tocilizumab in a list of potential medicines following a small study.
A Phase 2 trial in Italy includes a national trial following positive outcomes in patients with the disease.
With a black blood test to detect stocks, the target is to monitor the growth, which is likely the cause of some cases.
In 2017, the FDA approved the use of an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on a study of the treatment of a second-cause steroid called CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there is no evidence that tocilizumab has any efficacy in treating CRS.
Research is underway to provide clean and low-impact immune systems to COVID-19 survivors who need them as a non-vaccination alternative to extracted immune systems.
This method has been tested on SARS but has not been successful.
Viral deactivation is a preconceived process in which immune systems from another human can combine to fight SARS-CoV-2.
However, other techniques may be used, such as enlarging or increasing the immune system.
Other therapeutic techniques are being developed using extra-corporeal agents, such as laboratory-based agents.
Blood donations, including blood transfusions from wealthy individuals and military anti-virus systems, should be expanded to allow for faster access to the body.
Coronavirus is a group of diseases with only nine symptoms.
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, later contracted and died of COVID-19 after the virus outbreak was announced.
