No liberating amendment for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian parliament today denied a motion to repeal, as part of an amendment to the Criminal Code, the article on which opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko was convicted.
The new regulation, which could have paved the way for the liberation of the imprisoned prime minister, was rejected by MEPs at the second reading of the motion to reduce the penalties for economic offences.
Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for concluding a supposedly adverse gas purchase contract with Russia.
The verdict is not yet final, and the convicts' appeal will be heard in court in December.
Timoshenko himself calls the verdict a political revenge of the regime, and in the West, too, the trial has raised suspicions of court bias.
The motion to remove from the Criminal Code paragraph 365, on the basis of which the prime minister was convicted, was supported by 147 Members.
226 votes would have been required for its adoption.
Libyan Victory
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Qaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert, and without him the war is over.
Now only the winners have to be defined.
As usual in this region, Islamists win the elections, the only question is which - the moderate or the radical.
The National Transitional Council acknowledged the customary law of Sharīʿa, of which God now has a certain idea.
Libya would become a country without crime, because in short, theft is being chopped off.
Women should also quickly forget thoughts of emancipation, possible apostates are executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, the society of mutually conflicting tribes will henceforth be united by the Koran.
In short, there will be an order in Libya that is hardly conceivable in this country and, above all, hardly desirable.
Except - our lifestyle is not the only one and, objectively speaking, probably not the best and would hardly fit the mentioned Libyans.
From this point of view, it is rather strange that the Muslims, in general, let themselves be helped by the unbelieving dogs.
Their apologies may be based on the fact that NATO ’ s air strikes were directed not by some American general, but by Allah himself, whose omnipotence was extolled after every successful hit.
The winners in Libya? The West is not one of them.
We only took part in an exchange of fire, served the interests of Islam, and our politicians got rid of themselves in the person of the dictator of a political ally, without any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred to refrain from military occupation of Libya.
This leaves the locals with one concern - the expulsion of the crusaders.
But will the oil companies get the black gold at a mocking price even without occupation?
The West can hardly boast of its selflessness when it comes to protecting human rights, and rightly so at last.
If this does not spoil the Sharīʿa representatives.
Beginning of a New Crisis Era
France and the rest of Europe in the focus of investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm swept through Europe.
National governments published their GDP data for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the previous quarter, with Germany and France growing.
Today, however, the bond market is breaking all records.
Investors are watching not only Greece, but now Spain, France, Austria, and other countries as well.
The statistical offices of the European zone, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary economic forecasts for the third quarter.
Germany ’ s GDP grew by 0.5% as expected, and that of France by 0.4%.
Both countries simultaneously revised their data for the second quarter, when growth in Germany was higher than originally expected (growth of 0.3% instead of the 0.1% forecast), while France admitted a slight decline of 0.1% (initial figures only spoke of stagnation).
This year ’ s third quarter saw the Czech economy grow by 1.5 percent compared to the previous year.
Compared to the previous quarter, however, gross domestic product stagnated and, according to the Czech Statistical Office, this confirmed the trend of a slowdown in economic performance.
The results are therefore worse than analysts' forecasts.
The main events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year, but stagnated compared to the previous quarter.
According to preliminary and seasonal data, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
In the euro area as a whole and in the EU, the economy grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, in line with analysts ’ expectations.
The Greek economy contracted by 5.2 percent compared to the previous year.
The yield on their 10-year government bonds soared to 28.45%.
The yield on Italian and Spanish government bonds rose to its critical limits.
Also Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are beginning to feel problems...
Yields on Czech government bonds remain below 4%, although the situation in the region is deteriorating.
In Germany, voices are being raised that the ECB should become the creditor of last resort.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1: 0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football selection has mastered the hardest task of the season!
Thanks to a good-humored goalkeeper Čech and a magnificent goal by Petr Jiráček, she won 1: 0 in Montenegro.
With a big portion of luck, the Czech football was able to defend its luxurious lead from the home game and will once again not be missing at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the promotion game in a detailed report.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge portion of luck in the second.
The Czech selection won quite happily 1: 0 also thanks to the final weakness of the home team, a brilliant Czech and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro and has thus redeemed their ticket to the European Football Championship.
Due to the precise defensive game of the Czech team, they were only able to put the Montenegrins under more pressure in the second half.
The unlucky ones of the match were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who missed two huge chances.
Also thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, the Czech selection will participate in the European Championships next year, and it is also pleasing that the Czech football will receive a premium of approx. 200 million.
From the very first minutes on, quite combative football was played.
Both teams combined for a long time and so they played mainly around the middle line.
Also in the second half the pressure of the home team was absent and the wide tees in front of the penalty area were successfully repelled by the Czech defence.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country ’ s core program.
They formed a living shield.
A few hundred college students formed a live sign around a nuclear object in Iran.
With this gesture they wanted to demonstrate their support for the core programme of their country before a possible Israeli attack.
The students prayed in front of the object at noon on Tuesday and then announced their death to the USA and Israel.
A few hundred students from the university in Isfahan, Iran, formed a live sign around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan, where uranium is processed, on Tuesday.
They wanted to show that they are prepared to protect the core programme of their country, if necessary with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently stated in its report that Iran appears to have not given up its efforts to acquire a nuclear weapon.
In Israel, too, there is talk of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear installations.
At noon, students prayed outside the entrance to the complex and then proclaimed death to the United States and Israel.
According to the Israeli press, in the event of an attack intended to paralyze Iran ’ s nuclear program, the nuclear enrichment facility at the center of Isfahan would also be targeted.
The menu of a fatty child: it does not have breakfast and eats sausage with dinner
More than one third of children aged 9 to 13 have problems with obesity, with 9 percent of all pupils and 5 percent of all children being overweight.
Recent surveys have shown - obese children mostly come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
Once again, this shows how important the environment in which a person grows up and is the example that surrounds him is for his healthy development.
On the tables of obese children, sausages are up to half more often on the table than in families with normal-weight children.
More than 19 per cent of the overweight children had on the day before of the clearing-up action under the slogan “adiposity is no coincidence ” Pommes to supper.
In families with big kids, sports are not one of their favourite pastimes, although this also applies to the majority of today ’ s pupils – only 15 percent answered that their parents find time for active exercise at least once a week.
Survey among 900 children
The survey took place last year towards the end of the school year, with nearly 900 children from primary schools all over the Czech Republic being interviewed.
This was already the second year of the campaign "Obesity is not a coincidence", which is supported by the General Health Insurance and the Unilever company.
So far more than 12 thousand pupils from 4th and 8th grades have participated in the project.
Unhealthy diet and a lack of exercise in the family are the decisive factors responsible for the alarmingly increasing number of children who are overweight or even obese.
"Only half of the children surveyed, for example, stated that eating supper five times a day in the mode of breakfast" second breakfast "lunch" dinner "- one of the main requirements for a healthy diet", is one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that also relative little things, as for example also the regular breakfast time of the family, are important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the students ’ families have breakfast.
And - in most families everyone has their own breakfast.
Worst of all was the finding that in every tenth family there is no breakfast at all.
Breakfast is considered the cornerstone of a healthy daily diet.
The survey showed, among other things, that families of overweight children often consume unhealthy fries.
And almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemonades every day (70 percent)
More than 40 percent of the children surveyed do sports, but only less than half of their parents do so - namely only 15 percent.
Create your own menu
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to compile their own menu based on their appetite and opinion.
"What Czech children between 12 and 15 prefer in terms of nutrition is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among her favourite dishes were many pastries, meat dishes and, of course, desserts.
"Alarming is above all the great popularity of sweet lemonades", is emphasized in the final report of this survey.
At lunch, the main course, the pasta won just before poultry.
The children did not like legumes at all and also the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunch was very low.
Return to health
At the same time, the survey also showed that the children are quite willing to change their eating habits if they get the right information.
"In many cases, the control group of respondents who completed the questionnaire after completing the explanatory lecture" Obesity is not a coincidence "showed a significant shift in preferences towards principles of healthy eating", the results of the project state.
This was evident, for example, in the case of sweet limos, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
In the questionnaire, the children also crossed poultry or fish much more often as the main course of the day and were prepared to eat less dumplings or sweet food.
Professionals claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article about how stylists learn, I complained a bit that it was a bit too much stuff to start with.
Then I had no idea what was to come.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how the "on the pitch" works.
It is to come still worse.
The closer the examination gets, the more information and practical tasks await us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully booked.
This time we discussed with Director Alena (not a single man takes part in the course) how to attract a woman who does not have an ideally proportioned figure.
And these are, after all, most of us.
Some have a too short neck, others a too boyish figure without proper curves and still others are chubby.
It is up to the stylist to hide broad shoulders visually, to lengthen the neck or to conjure up the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to dress a type of woman like Jennifer Lopez - i.e. with a big bosom, wide hips and a narrow waist - nicely and figure-hugging, without being too provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hips is so big that the skirt or pants really don ’ t fit, you should have at least one piece tailored.
You will certainly not regret that, because well-fitting clothes are simply priceless.
In such a tailor-made skirt, one feels much better than in an off-the-peg skirt, which always slips up and down, stands out in the waist, etc.
In turn, boyish figures can allow themselves to wear clothes with folds, little balls, appliqués, embroidery or gathering.
With this amount of information and figure types I am glad that I have a whole week to let everything go through my head thoroughly.
And yet, I am afraid that, given the homework assigned, it is almost impossible.
Each of the course participants was assigned a celebrity, for whom she should think up suitable outfits - day wear and evening gowns.
We should consider the current appearance, the fashion style of the corresponding star and its type of figure.
I am supposed to "attract" Miranda Kerr, whom you may know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Internally, I ’ m cheering, because that ’ s much better for me personally than putting on Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, for example, who has probably gained about a hundred kilos lately (well, that ’ s a bit exaggerated), or even the young Selena Gomez.
We should cut the garments out of magazines or search on the Internet, print them and then process them graphically.
The "moodboard", as the whole result is called, is supposed to express our very personal style and our relationship to the graphic design.
It is very important to think about the graphic side of the styling.
The stylist not only attracts the models physically, but also creates the so-called product page in the journals (according to specific specifications, for example, trend, handbags, coats, etc.).
Stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about that.
But only on Sunday.
This means that a stylist must have a good overview.
The Saturday lecture, filled with information on figure types, was spiced by three visitors from the industry:
by stylist Jan Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a stylist should be able to exploit it.
And sent in stylist can work with a single piece of clothing in very different ways.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a trench coat over your jeans as usual, i.e., like a tee shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on your naked body, put on heel shoes and wear it as a dress.
It is enough to roll up the sleeves or the collar and the whole look looks completely different.
"Play with it," he stressed.
But the most convenient advice was: "First you have to know the rules perfectly."
"Only then can you hurt them," said Jakub.
I finally understand why we have to work on all these theories, what you can combine with what and why, even if you often see something completely different in fashion journals.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared many more clothing variations than he finally photographs.
So for a fashion story with ten pages (or ten outfits) you have to be prepared to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks very different than in reality.
With all this you have to expect when designing the outfit.
Jan Pokorný also confirmed that image and style make up half of our success.
You only need to look at Madonna, a not exactly brilliant singer, from whom image and marketing have made a world star.
In the Czech Republic the services of a stylist are rather reserved.
Also well-known personalities often regard this as thrown out money (the main thing is that I bring something, how I look thereby is secondary).
And if one of us can already be styled, then we should expect that he or she will most likely impose a completely different (smaller) size on us than he or she actually needs.
Then you only need to google afterwards, to determine with certainty, that the tabloid press writes, the corresponding celebrity has again closed or decreased, etc.
Jan and Mario advised us on Sunday not to believe that a stylist only needs to focus on fashion and then "assemble" the outfit.
In his work, he must above all communicate with the people he styles and he must be a skilled psychologist.
Assess people without bowing to them and stand by their opinion.
"If any manager orders us to sift through her wardrobe and add beautiful pieces, we can't clear out the whole closet and tell her - my god, that's terrible."
"You have to find at least a few praiseworthy things to which you recommend what you can wear," says Mario.
He also showed us quite concretely what a so-called "place bag" must contain.
In other words, a bag that you close at the waist and in which you carry all the necessary proprietary items with you.
Apart from such clear things as scissors, hair-removal dispensers or safety pins, it also contains such utensils as a nylon thread (this helps the stylist to take pictures of products such as handbags or hats), special clips with which the clothing is gathered at the back if it is too large (pins or other clamps are prohibited so that the fabric does not break) and, of course, sewing utensils.
So that we not only have to listen, but also can try something practical, we learned how to glue shoes correctly.
Even when photographing in the studio, where the floor is flat, you can damage the shoe sole, let alone the one outside.
We glued and glued ourselves o...
You must not even touch the shoes with scissors, so that they are not damaged.
So you have to be really clever.
Mario delighted me by praising my "creation" without reservations.
The aforementioned dexterity is not my strength.
All this was only a fraction of what we got to hear on the second weekend.
One thing has become clear to me in the meantime - to dedicate oneself to styling on a professional level is no child's play.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review
The originally carefree journey becomes an early shift due to a series of completely avoidable, amateurish errors.
It succeeded in fulfilling the ambitions to a large extent, but what use is that, if obviously nobody wanted to do a little more.
Even before it reached the counter, the new part with the subtitle "The Run" raised high expectations.
After all, he promised to move the already old game series "Need for Speed" into a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples he actually seemed to be not only one of many action, but also one of many racing games.
We were also curious about how the fitting passages would turn out, in which the main protagonist gets out of the car and continues on foot.
But as you are used to it with NFS, in the end a lot is different than you expected.
Sure - they are potentially quite decent arcade races, but overall the game is diminished by some unnecessary mistakes that have been present in this series for more or less a few years.
So these are actually no more mistakes, but rather signs of a basically incomprehensible laziness of the game developers.
The adventure starts very well.
First, one is introduced to the story, whose main character Jack has certain problems of a personal nature; the only solution seems to be to take part in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, i.e. on the West Coast, people sit at the wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea contains a number of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is held on a different course and that the individual stages take place in a different, sufficiently different and interesting environment.
You never get the impression that game would always offer the same thing.
Some environments are also very nice to look at, although the technical level of the graphics does not go beyond that of the earlier parts of the series.
So nothing earthshaking.
But the ride through the desert, through autumnal landscape or high up through deeply snow-covered landscape looks visually very pleasant.
Every now and then atypical elements bring a little variety to the individual races.
In the desert, for example, you will be surprised by a desert storm that severely restricts visibility.
In the mountains, on the other hand, you have to be very careful not to be buried by an avalanche.
Besides, the individual races are built in quite well in a row.
Only a few, but they are enough.
For a while you try to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to catch up (classic race against the stopwatch), then expect a personal duel with a single opponent.
And in addition, the police interfere, who want to screw up the whole thing.
A novelty are passages in which Jack leaves the car.
This is more about certain interactive animations in which Jack flees from someone and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are far fewer such passages in the game than one would expect (concretely only three).
In the end, this is more to the advantage of the game, because at least this element has no chance to get boring - in the context of the above mentioned it belongs to the elements that make the game more varied.
The model strides in the footsteps of the previous parts.
That is to say, seen from today's point of view, it does not tear up trees, but on the other hand one could not claim it would be bad.
If you are looking for realistic simulations, look elsewhere.
But for an action-packed racing driver, the local model will continue to do quite well, although you could find better in the competition.
Until then, everything is in perfect order.
Real problems only appear after a certain period of time.
In contrast to the driving model, the collision model is not completely OK
A game of this kind can hardly be expected to calculate complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have practically no idea how the car behaves before hitting any object, then obviously not everything is in order.
Typical example: When overtaking or driving past oncoming cars, one "grazes" the other car only slightly in some places, but in other, almost identical situations one gets into a catapult and turns wild pirouettes.
Or the cart goes straight to scrap metal.
Thanks to the restart of the system does not matter, ab annoying it is certainly.
The re-arts are solved like this: if you have total damage or land far away from the track, then the game throws you back to the last clue of the track.
Only - in each race you have only five restarts.
When you have exhausted it, everything starts again..
The re-arts are more like a tool, in case something doesn ’ t work, but you shouldn ’ t rely on that.
Sometimes, however, not even the restart helps, because nothing else helps than to learn the critical section from the head.
It is extremely unpleasant that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, you have to drive through some curves in a very specific way, otherwise you simply do not fit through.
Elsewhere, you will always encounter "civilian" cars in the same configuration, regardless of whether you arrive first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is particularly annoying in situations when you see that the opponent passes two oncoming cars in front of you, but by the time you get there yourself, the cars are already in such a position that you have to drive around or brake them.
And it does not matter when you arrive there, because everything is designed so that it comes to this situation always close to your nose.
The counterparties have other advantages.
Throughout the game there are a few places where you are always overtaken by the same opponent at the same place and here again regardless of the time.
This is craziest at the end of the game on the long bridge you pass in the opposite direction.
The opponent obviously has to overtake you.
And when he is in front of you, he of course takes the view, so that you can drive your own car in Klump a few times at the beginning.
Sure - you just want to make the game more thrilling and exciting, but this intention is so clear that it quickly spoils your enjoyment of the game.
And that's a pity, because despite the simpler driving model, the game is quite entertaining and sometimes so action-packed that you almost no longer know where the head is.
And in principle, it doesn't matter what's "to blame" for it - the concept of fifty unique routes, the layout of the races in such a way as to avoid boredom, or something completely different...
An unusual idea is also the car change during the races.
One must not overlook the gas stations at the route, because it is here that one can change the car, although in most cases the car that one has is sufficient.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for urban areas, the strong American limousines for the straight highways and exotic super sports cars for technical journeys, for example on the serpentines in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the mode of game history also goes the tasks of the mode (challenges) - thus the races in the individual localities, which one knows from the history.
Here there are not only medals, but also experience points for the own profile to win, which is together for the tasks (challenges) and the history.
In order to reach the higher driver level, various objects must be unlocked: from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is simultaneously associated with the online function Autolog, which compares, among other things, the own achieved results with those of other players and also provides for other collective functions.
One of the other incomprehensible carvers is a situation in the last race of history.
Here you get namely by car in a subway "tunnel" (meinetwegen), where you race in the dark on the rails long (meinetwegen).
On the speedometer, numbers between 150 and 200 km / h (because of me) look, but there comes all at once from behind a subway and drives one uncompromisingly to scrap metal.
In our editorial office we will probably argue for a long time about whether this was a blackout of the game designers or whether the authors think we are so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the visual overall impression is in most cases quite appealing and here and there even brilliant.
This makes it all the more annoying that at some exciting moments the refresh rate slows down and this is sometimes quite dramatic.
That concerns however in particular the accidents with larger number of involved ones, where a continuous FPS does not profit one anyway.
Sound reproduction is OK so far and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to appeal to such a broad as possible range of rather young audiences, a soundtrack was created a lá "something from everyone" - but who buys such a game because of the music?!
The general impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are mixed.
If the game were not diminished by the mentioned totally unnecessary mistakes, we could have said with the phatt of conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in the last years.
But so the game seems somehow unfinished.
A great pleasure in itself, but you should be prepared for these mistakes with the power of airport headlights to stand out in the eye.
Concert of "Students of the Velvet Revolution" with singing ensembles of the Charles University
For the third time, the Festa Academica festival offers the combination of World Students Day with the anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, including a musical experience.
In the course of the festival about twenty professional and university choirs present themselves.
The festival will focus on the two concerts that will take place on 17 November.
"The Charles University has a large part in the festival."
"The participants include the choir of the Faculty of Education and the Faculty of Humanities Studies, and the festival committee includes the Rector Václav Hampl," said Jakub Čaloun, head of the organisation team.
The absolute highlight of the festival is the public concert of professional school choirs, which will take place on 17 November from 2 p.m. on the square in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
The programme includes a composition by the great Czech jazz player Karel Růžička "Celebration Jazz Mass".
In the evenings, a concert entitled "Students of the Velvet Revolution" will be held in the gala rooms of the People's House in Vinohrady. Choirs from the Charles University will also perform.
Festa Academica aims not only to celebrate World Student Day with dignity and to commemorate the 22nd anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, but also to present choral music at the highest level to the public and to promote the creative cooperation of young people.
The main organizer is the Czech Choir Association in cooperation with the Johannes Kepler Gymnasium.
The event was held under the patronage of Bohuslav Svoboda, Mayor of Prague and Václav Hampl, Rector of Charles University.
The festival will take place from 16 to 20 November in Prague and Pardubice.
The schedule includes, besides festival concerts, numerous musical meetings, student happenings, matinees and other events.

EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativists and Eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has noticeably upset the balance between the various institutions."
I did not expect such a hard war to break out. "
"It will take five or six years for the waves to calm down and for everyone to get used to their new role," said Milena Vicenová, the Czech Ambassador to the European Union, when she began her keenly speaking at the Faculty of Law.
Already in the first part of her lecture, in which she succeeded in describing the individual bodies of the EU and their mutual relations in such a clear and comprehensible way that many a lecturer of the Faculty of Law of the Charles University could have envied her, she showed how seriously she takes the motto "understandable and open about Europe".
Ms Vicenová also praised the new permanent President of the Council of Europe, Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first there was criticism that he was too inconspicuous - a gray official who could not cope with such a role, but I have to say it took everyone's breath away how well he took care of the matter.
"He is a person who manages to listen patiently to twenty-seven member states, to communicate with them and, above all, has clear ideas about how the EU should proceed.
She then explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy as an answer to the question: Who is this actually - the European Union? Which number should I call? ", i.e. as an important step towards agreement and better readability of the EU's policy towards states such as China or India.
Nobody wants to forbid us our oil cap toppings
Mrs Vicenová also addressed the agenda according to which the European Union lived, lives and intends to live in the near future.
She described the Czech Presidency of two years ago as a success.
The Czechs had overcome the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also organised the Eastern Partnership Summit.
She described the case of the government during the Presidency as a major negative factor which had severely damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU currently has its hands full.
In the words of the Ambassador, things were quite hectic not only with the Presidency, but also with the ensuing crisis, which has not yet been overcome.
And the EU ’ s Seven Year Budget still has to be approved, which makes matters much more complicated precisely because of the current economic situation.
Whether it will be a lean and thrifty budget, which sectors will be prioritised, which countries will receive more and which less support, all this is now on the agenda.
The Ambassador also recalls her own slogans with which she came to Brussels: 'Understandable about Europe'.
"If I don't like something, it's greyish abbreviations, foreign words and jargon that nobody understands.
As a citizen, how am I supposed to know whether people in Brussels really think up crooked or round cucumbers and bananas of different sizes, or whether someone really wants to ban us from toppings?
It would also have liked to use EU soil to get more Czechs into European institutions.
A two- or multi-speed Europe in prospect
According to the EU ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for being Eurosceptics, who perceive the negative rather than the positive sides of the matter.
All the more annoying is the weak representation of Czechs in European institutions.
Many factors are to blame, including the reluctance of our candidates, their inability to write motivation letters and, last but not least, the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech presidency, she also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the V4 group.
"Believe me, if a Pole or Hungarian comes to me and a Slovak is nearby, then the Frenchman next to me says:" Hey, what are you sticking your heads together - is that your V4 again? "and yet makes a pretty sour face.
According to Vicenové, the EU expects tough rules for the budget policies of the member states in the future.
It regards the concept of a two-speed Europe as much more real than a 'European federation'.
"We have here the countries of the euro area and the countries outside the euro area.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute of Enhanced Cooperation."
"For the first time it has been said that only those countries which want to should cooperate and that those which do not want to do so should stand on the sidelines."
"There will be more and more such institutions, which will ultimately lead to a strong 'multi-speed Europe'", expects Ms Vicenová.
In this regard, she also praised the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in enforcing the principle that all issues affecting the entire EU must be discussed by all member states and not only by the eurozone countries.
Brand story:
The innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence
If one wanted to search for a suitable word that characterizes IBM's strategy the most precisely, then this would probably be the word "longevity".
For the general public, IBM is synonymous with technological revolution, known as a modern enterprise, although a century has passed since its inception.
Her first boss - the visionary Thomas J. Watson senior - laid the foundation for this longevity.
Already he advocated the slogan that countless global problems could be easily solved if people were willing to think a bit.
His slogan "Think!" thus became a trademark around which the life of the future giant was to take place (and at the same time the title of the company magazine, which IBM began to publish in 1935).
This was also the basis of the corporate culture thoroughly prepared by Watsen.
"For us at IBM, this long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was successful for an entire century, also because it remained true to its principles and did not shrink from changing everything else around it.
This allowed us, during the first century, to transform technologies, business and society.
We hope to achieve even more in the next hundred years, "said Samuel J. Palmisano, the current director of the company on the occasion of the anniversary.
Smart system
As early as the 1930s, Watson was already providing social care for his employees – in a similar way to the entrepreneur Baťa in Czechoslovakia: IBM ’ s people were one of the first American employees to have paid vacation, be insured by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as work clothes, and have a thoughtful remuneration system for the best innovators and traders.
IBM's long-term relationships with its customers are equally sophisticated.
From the outset, the company was ingenious at promoting talent - IBM was one of the first companies in the world to eliminate all discrimination - and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy is also the current plan that will alternate Palmisan at the head of IBM next year by a woman - by Virginia Rometty.
She has been with IBM for thirty years and has held the position of Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
In recent years, IBM has been conducting so-called online brainstorming sessions, from which many future strategies and innovations have arisen.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, the company employs almost half a million people.
An institution with a good reputation
Their unshakable position in the business guarantees a strong image for the company, both internally and externally.
"From the beginning, IBM has had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company," said Harvard Business School professor and author of a book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technology," George Colony of Consulting, Forrester Research, added.
As the company itself points out, it makes a difference to be only present on the market or to shape it directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of their logo called familiarly "Big Blue", has grown in a century to one of the largest companies in the world.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies ever - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in an incredible product range - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies, IBM holds the most patents, and five of its employees have been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His most famous inventions include ATMs, credit cards, financial swap, barcodes and even diskettes.
With a market capitalization of about 220 billion dollars, IBM was the second largest technology company (after Apple) this year, overtaking Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Looking Ahead
Not all products and innovations met the taste of the customers of today - unfortunate were for example the attempt with the own operating system OS / 2, the on-line ¼ service Prodigy or also the computers IBM PC jr.
"Business is based on moving forward, so one must not bind oneself emotionally to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore IBM has no problem to build its foundations on different platforms - and if they don't work, to leave them again.
Contrary to the opponent Microsoft, which stands and falls in principle with its operating system Windows.
Promising technologies
Services, software and hardware each contribute a fifth to the profits of IBM.
Even in 1990, hardware was represented most strongly with a share of more than fifty percent.
Since 2000, IBM has sold little profit-generating assets worth $15 billion, but invested $58 billion at the same time in technology purchases.
In these investments, IBM continues after 2008, when the modern financial crisis swept the world like a storm for the first time.
Here, too, IBM remained faithful to the legacy of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who increased investment in the midst of the Great Depression.
So far it seems that the company IBM survives today's crisis unscathed.
The value of IBM ’ s equities has skyrocketed by 120 percent since 2008, and the company ’ s net profit continues to grow.
The company slogan of IBM is: everything can be changed - except the values.
This is another reason to expect this flexible giant to master the next crisis.
IBM History: From Cheese Slicer to World Flights
IBM (International Business Machines), founded one hundred years ago in New York, initially had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM only in 1924 - originally it was about a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation stone for the later company IBM was laid by the merger of four companies whose history dates back to the 1980s of the 19th century.
They possessed technologies such as the famous puncture card watches for registering the start and end of work.
Charles Ranlett Flint, who also served as Chairman of the Supervisory Board until 1930, became the architect of this new company.
And it was Flint who hired the head of the rival company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
This leader then outshone even the founders of IBM - based on Watson's ideas to this day the invincible culture and identity of the company.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, began with the production and sale of all kinds of machines for trade - from sausages and cheese slicers to checkout counters.
In the first four decades of running the company, Watson doubled its sales to nine million dollars, and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable for the company that he sat in the executive chair for forty years, only then was he replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, technicians and computers from IBM helped NASA direct flights into space - to Mercury and Saturn, and in 1969 also the famous flight of man to the moon.
In 1964 IBM developed the first computer family with the same architecture - the series IBM System / 360.
A classic PC, which was the computer standard at that time, was launched in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand it bought the consultancy part of the PricewaterhouseCoopers company and thereby entered fully into the business of consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy that has paid off for IBM over the past three years is the "Smarter Planet" concept.
It embodies the intention to use technology wisely in areas not even planned so far, for example to improve the situation in transport and in city management.
In the retail sector, IBM recently launched the Smarter Commerce platform to help retailers manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
As early as 1932, IBM founded a branch in what was then Czechoslovakia - the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague, which is also home to a world-class research team dealing with voice recognition technology.
Darina Rychtářová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta - you can keep this donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53), the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), became her lover, Darina still hoped that Josef would wake up from his rose-red dream and return home.
But now the patience is finally over and she has set herself clear rules for the rest of her life.
"Josef can come home, but not more than my partner", explained D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová offered singer I. Bartošová a place of refuge in her own house, she probably wouldn ’ t even have dreamt what her husband ’ s fate would be like.
When, at her insistence, Iveta moved back and forth to Říčany after 30 days, Josef went with her.
He even confessed publicly that he loved her.
Over time Darina resigned, it even seemed as if she wanted to reconcile herself with her unfaithful husband - but now she finally gave him the pass.
Rychytář Doesn ’ t Matter Who His Wife Sleeps With
If Rychtář were to leave Iveta Bartošová in the future, he would certainly not receive open arms at home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to end his days in our common home, then I will not drive him out."
"However, not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a person with whom I still have certain ties," Mrs. Rychtářová revealed, but she also said that she had already emotionally separated from him and insisted only on mutual decency.
The fact that Darina locked his back door has so far been borne by Josef with dignity.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I will stay together with Iveta, nothing will change."
"My wife wants a paper and I respect that."
"The company continues to run, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I do the shopping."
"I have a normal conversation with Darina, but we don't share the bed," said J. Rychtář (to the paper) Blesk.
If Darina wants to look for a new love, he doesn't want to stop her.
"We don't sleep together, so I don't care if she has a friend or who that is.
I realize that this is my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and therefore I take all responsibility.
The worst female vices: how about you?
When men are asked to name some typical female vices, they invariably shake some out of their sleeves.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself again in the following lines, in which we review a few bad habits, which cause the blood to flow in the veins of men?
Shopping addiction
Does their husband reproach them for being addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one quarrel a week?
Do you like to go shopping and may it be a little more for promotions?
In your case, then, there is a real weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their desire to shop under control.
But hand on heart, which woman can stand to stroll through a clothing store in search of a well-fitting outerwear and not immediately try out all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Although shopping is a hobby for most women, for men it is often pure hell.
Think about it, how often you told your husband - you better stay outside...
Permanent dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"I would have to lose at least five kilos - should I start jogging or gymnastics?"
"Do I like you at all?"
Does this sound familiar to them?
Yes?
Then you will also be one of those women who are downright obsessed with what they look like.
This does not mean that you should let go, but many men are allergic to the fact that their wife is constantly complaining about her appearance.
The stronger sex is agreed - with rising frequency of the complaints the women are ever more intolerable.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It is a fight against windmills.
Clean windows, wipe tiles and dust, scrub the tub - at least twice a week.
Are you scolding your partner for once again trampling on the clean tiles with dirty shoes? Are you scolding the children because the recently scoured sink is dirty again and because the glass door on the living room cupboard already has fingerprints again, when polishing is so much trouble?
Should you suffer from this kind of "deviance", then you should know that one must not exaggerate anything and that the order and cleanliness in the family life are not in the first place.
This excessive purity craze can ultimately also harm mutual relationships and, above all, peace in the family.
Stickleback
"Dirty gym pants are coming into the laundry basket."
"Do you really want to put the old socks on again tomorrow?"
"You don't just throw a wet towel on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, you should not be surprised that this puts him on the palm.
That is not meant badly, they just want everything to be in order.
If men knew this, women might not need to complain so much.
Gossip
Some women like to clap and gossip, whispering or even slandering behind their backs, or making alliances.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to scramble through such topics as who, where, with whom, how and why.
Probably each of us women has a bit of harmless gossip in store.
Hand on heart - that is probably characteristic of all women.
But this is not to be confused with gossip tanks of the coarsest calibre, to whom nothing and no one is sacred, who despise everyone in their surroundings and who represent a considerable danger, especially for women ’ s collectives.
Jágr and Voráček helped Philadelphia to victory with their assistants
With two assistants, ice hockey striker Jaromír Jágr made a major contribution to the 5-3 victory of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina, making him once again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
Beneficiary of the overview of the thirty-nine year old ice hockey star was in both cases Claude Giroux, who added an assistant and was proclaimed the best player of the match.
Two assistants in the same game also recorded Jágr's teammate Jakub Voráček.
Jágr claimed to journalists after the game that he had predicted Giroux a great evening.
"Even before the game I tell him that he manages a hat trick today."
I felt that somehow. "
"Every now and then such a feeling comes over," explained Jágr, after whose action Giroux scored a goal already at the first shot of the Flyers.
A little later the second hit also had "a Czech track".
Voráček fought for the puck behind the goal of the hurricanes and presented it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
One second before the whistle of the first third home team player Patrick Dwyer scored a short Hander, but the second third belonged to the Flyers again.
Specifically Giroux.
In cooperation with Jágr he scored his third goal, after that Wayne Simmonds directed his shot to the fourth goal.
"I love to play with him."
"I don't want to say that he is the best player in the league, but he certainly belongs to the top three," Jágr praised his center.
"It wouldn't have occurred to me in my life to play with an ice hockey player like him at the end of my career."
"That makes me very happy."
"I'm cutting my game towards me."
"All those years in the NHL my fellow players adjusted their game to me and now the tables are turned," Jágr smiled.
Carolina turned the game into a drama - Tuoma Ruutua's hits and once again Dwyer, who prevailed from a penalty shot, hit a goal.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complication, in which he succeeded in outnumbering two against one.
"Pronger did an excellent job in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I picked up speed and (Read) moved to farther posts."
"I tried to hit him and I am glad that it worked", Voráček described the last goal of the match from his point of view.
By this victory Philadelphia placed itself at the head of the Eastern Conference.
Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček was injured in the game against Buffalo and dropped out in the second third due to an injury on the upper body.
Besides their experienced Beck, the Candiens also lost their lead in a 2-3 shootout.
Tomáš Plekanec could not change one of the punitive shots.
More than the lost points, the coach of the home team was probably hurt by the high illness-related loss on the defensive - they played the game with only five defenders to the end.
"That's bad."
"The match ended with only one experienced player, the rest were young players."
"But nothing can be done about it, we have to deal with it", said Jacques Martin.
"With each change one attack wave after the other and we had nothing to oppose."
"We should have made the game easier and got the puck out of our third."
There were reserves here, "said P. K. Subban, one of the defenders.
Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec defended thirty shots from Tampa Bay and thus contributed significantly to the 5-2 victory over Winnipeg.
At the goals of the Jets, which hereby ended a series of five defeats, five different shooters took part.
Development of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorised state travel agencies in the former Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies sold at that time above all only journeys into the socialist Eastern bloc countries, to the west at that time only selected ones were allowed.
And so Czech tourists travelled to the Baltic Sea (to the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary at the Balaton.
A clear exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when one was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia took a pro-Western course and therefore the trips to Yugoslavia were severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that not even citizens of the Eastern Bloc (including the Czechoslovakians) were allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the Czechoslovak Republic wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he or she would need a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual travel was not possible.
Already at that time the travel agencies offered also journeys into the west, then one had to take however gigantic queues into account or also overnight in the sleeping bag before the travel agency, and / or have at least "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
Even so, the matter was far from over.
The so-called foreign currency promise - the condition for an exit to the West - was only given to "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so without the promise of foreign currency it would have been impossible to find the necessary financial resources (Western currency) for a trip to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays inland, so it is no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend cottages and dacha - a habit that continues to this day.
The Velvet Revolution of 1989 was followed by a Czechs travel revolution.
While until 1989 holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria were the measure of all things, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their holidays abroad in countries all over the world.
A huge paradox, of which one is not even aware today, is the fact that one could not travel to the currently most popular holiday country of the Czechs - Croatia at all until 1989, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
Right from the beginning of the 90s of the last century, the foreign exchange obligation was lifted in the neighboring Western European countries, which caused a huge wave of short visits, especially to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
For a long time the Czechoslovakians simply could not get enough of their trips to the West, everyone wanted to have been there at least for a few days.
During their trips to Paris, the Czech holidaymakers slept in a tent in the park, because who would have had the money for accommodation in a hotel or pension back then.
A typical feature of trips by Czechs abroad was a trunk packed with canned goods, beer and dried sausages etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech Koruna - after decades our tourists were finally able to buy the Western currency freely.
Our standard of living and, as a result, our average salaries rose, which led to another important moment in 1997.
Due to increased demand for travel, travel agencies began preparing regular charter flights after 1997, making air travel incredibly cheaper than in the past, thanks to the ability to negotiate volume discounts.
At the end of the 1990s the Czechs, with the exception of the USA, already had currency-free payments with all the highly developed countries of the world, which made travelling even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of the "post" velvet tourism came in 2000, when due to high demand the first direct charter flight to an exotic country - Thailand - was handled.
Since then, direct charter flights with Czech passengers have been flying to distant sunny countries every year; this year twelve exotic destinations are being served directly from the Czech Republic.
About 100 thousand Czechs travel to exotic countries every year!
Another significant moment in the epoch that marked our "post-revolutionary" development came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the USA lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, making our country definitely one of the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, for the first time, the Czechs spent more than half of their holiday abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, they spent more than CZK 15 thousand per capita on a single holiday including the cost of the resort.
The general meeting is to find a new chairman - again a stalemate threatens.
For almost five months, Czech football has had no chairman, and there is a risk that the successor to Ivan Hašek at the head of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR) will not be known even after the extraordinary general meeting in Nymburk on Thursday.
To date, no agreement has been reached on the rules governing elections.
And without them, no vote at all on the three potential successors is possible.
Three interested parties want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek resigned from his position, urging his colleagues to come to an agreement and find a strong personality to lead football in the future.
But in the post-Hašek era, the old quarrels between the two chambers of the association broke out again, and they could not agree on a common candidate.
This was made abundantly clear on 16 September, when the new chairman was to be selected.
The delegates of the Annual General Meeting came to the People ’ s House in the Smíchov district of Prague for free, because the negotiations did not lead to any result and it was not only about the election itself.
It was not even possible to agree on who was actually entitled to vote at the plenary - only the statutory representatives or even the functionaries with a power of attorney.
Agreement was reached, at least in part, on this single point, helped by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, which considers that representation on a power of attorney basis is not permitted.
Disputes over the election rules continue, however.
Nor did the Executive Committee shed any light on the matter, at whose meetings - whether ordinary or extraordinary - there is nothing else on the agenda in principle.
Even if views on the election changed a few times, the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question is: what should be done in the third round to avoid a stalemate?
Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-chairmen of FAČR, who represents professional football in the management, stated: "The issue is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or whether to find a completely different model."
According to the statutory model, in the third round, the candidate who receives the greater percentage support in the chamber for which he is standing for election wins.
Moravia is supposedly prepared to accept the compromise that the candidate receiving the higher number of votes from both chambers should win.
The Czech side insists on the condition that the winner receives at least a two-thirds majority in this percentage vote count.
"Then the two preliminary rounds will no longer make sense at all, this method would call the entire bicameral concept into question", Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, which would find it best not to bend the election regulations, but to vote according to the valid statutes.
Surprisingly, Tomáš Paclík agrees to this, even if it is becoming apparent that the statutory election regulations are the most likely to accommodate Pelta of all candidates.
"It is my wish that as far as possible be elected according to the statutes."
"In order to avoid any unreasonable alternatives, as at the last general meeting," explained owner (of the football club) Victoria Plzeň, who is running for the first time and has distinguished himself from Pelta in his statements.
But Pelta remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also cooperate constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the European Football Championship today would certainly contribute to calm minds."
"When football is on the wave of euphoria, there is a greater willingness to cooperate," says the Jablonec functionary, who has the most experience of all three adepts, both at the professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more reserved.
"I hope to reach an agreement, but the situation is unfortunately ambivalent."
"This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain efforts to" straighten out "the regulations for one's own purposes."
"Therefore a further blockage at the Annual General Meeting is not impossible."
"However, I hope that common sense will prevail in the end," Rajchl said.
Only - there is not much time left for the agreement of all sides.
Some negotiations were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the football generality will be complete in the run-up to the qualifying match.
The charter plane, with which among others Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl were to fly to Podgorice, could not take off at all in the morning in Prague due to a technical malfunction and so there was a feverish search for a substitute variant, how to bring a part of the executive committee to the venue of the Barrage.
In the end, the meeting at ministerial level, which is supposed to take place on Wednesday, will be crucial.
Josef Dobeš, the Minister for Education, Youth and Physical Education, would have liked to have persuaded the divided parties within the largest sports federation in the country to reach an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the trustworthiness of Czech football and also the upcoming general meeting of the ČSTV, which is supposed to show the Czech sport the new direction after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík goes to fight for the position of chairman because he does not see a suitable candidate
If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsen football team, could have identified a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting, who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have entered into the fight for this top position at all.
"If there were a good candidate, I would fight for him and forgo the election."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such an adept," said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík to go into a duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is to prevent the supposed favourite of the election, Pelta, from taking the lead of the FAČR.
Paclík also emphasizes that in the event of his victory, he intends to exercise the function of Chairman only for one year, i.e. until 2013, the date of the Annual General Meeting.
In the position of chairman, he would have liked to see an experienced top manager who is not too involved in football.
"I spoke to a few people personally."
"Hard to believe that some people told me that they did not want to identify with Czech football at the moment.
"Such views would have liked to change," he said.
Most of all, Paclík allegedly interferes with Pelta ’ s association with the chairman of the Pilsen District Football Association, Roman Berbr, a man of controversial reputation who is a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes with the ability to influence delegate votes at general meetings.
For Paclík, it is therefore unacceptable that Pelta should hold the position of chairman.
"With his victory, the present state would be preserved and there would be no progress at all in Czech football."
"The support of Berbr, a clever business man, would be twice as bad for football," stressed Paclík.
He also referred to the fact that Pelta's name was discovered some time ago in connection with telephone taps to investigate a corruption affair, but the Pelta was found to be unpunished.
"I don't know what prestige a victory of Pelta should bring to (tsch.) football."
"And how would we look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said řekl Paclík, who is somewhat more relaxed when he said earlier that he would sell the Pilsen football club if Pelta became chairman.
Should Paclík win the Thursday election, he could well imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
Another candidate - Rajchl, who was supported by Paclík before the general meeting in October, which ended with a fiasco, thinks the same.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go to."
"He has great abilities".
"I could well imagine him as the head of the national team, for example."
"But I don't think he is able to lead the association as a manager."
"I'm not sticking my nose into matters that I don't understand," said Paclík, who caused a stir in September when he led by Luďěk Macela, who replaced Dagmar Damková, behind the dismissal of the panel of arbitrators.
Paclík himself claims that he feels equal to the role of the president of the association.
In doing so, he relies on his skills in managing private companies, and since last summer he has also been head of Pilsen, which celebrated its first triumph in the league with his support in May.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and to contribute to a certain cultivation of it."
"To limit the influence of certain interest groups that tend to influence disciplinary and appeal committees, which degenerates into repugnant situations," said Paclík, who makes no secret of his antipathy towards Sparta, for example, chief Daniel Křetínský.
One of his priorities would be to strengthen the ties between the FACR and the Czech Olympic Committee, which would help lobbying top politicians for more money from the lottery tax to go into sports.
"This is one of the crucial things the new chairman should devote himself to".
"When it comes to the taxation of games of luck, as the political parties declare, then I understand their arguments, but they must also state clearly where the money is going," he said.
Paclík does not regard his connection to the club in Pilsen as a handicap either, although he himself stresses that the chairman of the FAČR must be "non-partisan".
Pelta in turn is connected with Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla.
"This is not ideal."
"In my opinion, it does not make much sense to hypocritically transfer my shares in the Pilsner Klub to a third party in order to return after one and a half years", Paclík clarified.
Pelta promised new statutes of FAČR, which exclude a stalemate in the future.
Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the chairmanship, Miroslav Pelta, promised that, if elected, he would support the formation of new statutes for the FAČR, which would exclude from the outset any disputes over the election regulations.
The official from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday negotiations in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will be defused if the Czech selection is successful.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealized election in September that he would concentrate on the national team and the extraction of funds in case of his election.
He decided only at the last moment to participate in the election before the last general meeting, so the two-month break would help him to defend and present his ideas on the management of football in a broader context.
"People at all levels are dedicated to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is high time for the association to be led by someone," says the man, who is mainly associated with the Jablonec club, but who also worked for many years at Sparta and in the executive committee.
For this reason, too, he believes that he has sufficient experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that the euphoria that reigned at the time of Ivan Hašek is responsible for today ’ s problems with the election.
"Unfortunately, at the General Meeting in June statutes were approved that were not as perfect as everyone had accepted.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman from September, "said Pelta.
He used the revision of the most important document of the civil association as a lure for the delegates.
"Should I become chairman, then I will personally take care of it and I am ready to take personal responsibility if it does not work."
"This is a matter of principle without which it cannot be," claims Pelta.
In the following, he does not try to differentiate himself from his opponents.
He had previously announced that he could envisage cooperation with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he recognizes for his legal education, and he knows well that his opponent would be his first deputy.
He also did not attack Tomáš Paclík for a long time, who did not leave a dry thread to Pelta.
In football he has been moving for over a year and can already point to certain successes. "
"However, his attacks were disparaging and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"This is another reason why many people now doubt his real character," Pelta addressed his opponent, who will probably remain faithful to the proclamations he made in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest divisions to the national team.
And this should be the flagship of Czech football.
"I would also strive to end all affairs - from the Causa Bohemians to the aftermath of last year's corruption scandal."
"Immediately after that, I would rush to negotiations with the private and state sector in order to secure sufficient funds for the whole football," said forty-six year old candidate ČTK two months ago.
At that time, he also promised that his entry into the top ranks of Czech football would not mean personnel cleansing.
"I would have to familiarise myself with the work of all employees," he said in the direction of Strahov, where nervousness understandably prevails due to the long anarchy.
Despite the catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming general meeting, he believes that the delegates will not travel to Nymburk on Thursday for nothing.
"If really the only contentious point is how to vote in the third round, then we get over it."
"Football needs credibility and it can only win back if it finally has a new leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the potentially decisive day of his functionary career.
Rajchl promises that FAČR will start working hard under him
If the former Vice-Chairman Jindřich Rajchl were to be elected as the new Chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at the General Meeting on Thursday, this would supposedly spoil the mood of many people in the Association.
Rajchl promises to start working hard if he is elected.
He wants to introduce system changes and make the members of the executive committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to resolve Bohemian ’ s case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, put more money into football and otherwise continue the work begun by the previous president, Ivan Hašek.
"As chairman I want to dedicate myself to football as a whole."
From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to national selection, professional football and competitive football for young people. "
"I do not mean to say that I want to do everything alone," Rajchl said in an interview for ČTK.
"I am a team player and therefore want to distribute the competences in the executive committee in such a way that each member dedicates himself to a certain area."
And I will be distributing tough tasks so that football progresses by milestones in each segment. "
Many would not be delighted with this, because instead of just criticizing the work of others, they would have to start working really hard themselves, "he added.
Due to the critical atmosphere in the football movement, it was considered not to run at all.
"I'm known to work 20 hours a day."
"But I must know that it makes sense and that there are people behind me who do not constantly throw clubs between my legs and question every step I take," he said as an explanation why he hesitated.
"But many people told me that I should not give up, because otherwise others would do the same."
"This is trust that must not be wasted," he said.
He is also said to be motivated to continue the work he started under Hašek.
"In two years we have done a lot of work and I don't want to throw that away."
"Trials have been started, which will probably only come into effect in a few years and I would be reluctant to see anyone stop them," he said, expressing his concern that if the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta was elected, the situation could return to the times before Hašek.
"I believe in systematic procedure and that is something that Mirek Pelta does not bring."
"Behind him are above all people who would make the football in such a way that it would only be there for the chosen ones."
I can certainly be accused of many things, but not of being biased. "
"I try to be objective."
"I want football for everyone, because then everyone is fine and not just the chosen ones," Rajchl remarked.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a leader of the Czechs.
"Even if some people claim the opposite, I really intend to do the best possible for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider dividing the league into a Czech and a Moravian division, whose winners then each advanced to the first league."
"Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the league, which is a problem especially for the young players in Moravia," says Rajchl.
Because the head of the Pilsen club Tomáš Paclík joined the struggle for the position of the chairman, Rajchl does not dare to estimate his chances of being elected.
"I feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its vice-chairman and now recognises that there are clear successes behind me," said Rajchl, who also regards the saving of tens of millions of crowns for unfavourable contracts, the conclusion of television contracts and the negotiations on the lottery law as his success.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the fact that the federation does not pull in the same direction.
While he says of Pelta that "he is disqualified from the outset to give new confidence to Czech football", he considers the second rival - Paclík to be a strong candidate who really has something to offer to football.
"No one can question that he did an excellent job in Pilsen in just one year."
"If he were elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Hašek initiated, and he would obviously not fundamentally change the staffing of the commissions."
He certainly wouldn ’ t want to turn things in his favor, ” Rajchl assesses his rival.
Europe ’ s Most Beautiful Pools
Jump into the Blue
By Julia Stanek
Paddling pools in Ufo design, magnificent pools in Budapest: If you travel through Europe, you can experience a blue wonder - and relax your tired legs in bubble baths after a city tour or a hike.
A book shows where wellness in the water is most beautiful.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip in the past year and a half, she could not miss one thing in her luggage: her swimsuit.
Lying backwards on the water, she looked up into artistically designed domes, swam towards marble-putti waiting at the edge of the pool, and marveled at meticulously restored Art Nouveau swimming halls.
If she liked a bath, she quickly added it to her notebook - including interesting details about the building's construction and history.
Architecture historian Meder explored more than 200 swimming pools in this way - and now presents them in her recently published book "Badefreuden": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historical bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore" concrete buildings in the Taunus.
Her "journey to the most extraordinary spas in Central Europe" took her through 13 countries: in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing enthusiast.
She doesn ’ t have much to do with sports, says Meder – but it ’ s different in the water.
The only annoying thing is that swimming fans have to resign themselves to blue tiles and chlorine stench, while joggers can inhale the beguiling scent of spruce forests or listen to the cheerful chirping of birds in the park.
"One day I wondered why swimming pools always have to be so ugly," says Meder, who lives in Vienna.
"So I started to collect beautiful baths."
Water surface doubles architecture
Splashing in the diving pool and essential sauna - the wellness factor in baths is so great because all the senses are served, says Meder.
And if the builders have made an effort, swimming pools can be a real feast for the eyes: "Instead of a floor, you have a water surface in baths."
"On the one hand it is transparent, but on the other it reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything doubles visually: high vaults, colourful tiles, springboards.
On 190 pages, the small-format illustrated book "Badefreuden" (Bathing Pleasures) conveys interesting facts about the architectural and cultural history of historical wellness and oases - but above all, it makes you want to jump into the blue.
Meder discovered remarkable specimens during her research in Hungary.
In addition to splendid thermal baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Baths in Budapest, she found a nitrate-containing water in a rustic karst cave (Miskolc Cave Spa) and a thermal bath, whose pools are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Many heated outdoor swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the Zurich Dachbad has the whole city in mind, the outdoor pool of a swimming pool in St. Anton offers a view of the snow-covered Arlberg - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which you can observe the hustle and bustle on the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most unusual pool design awaits bathers in Längenfeld: the Aquadome Ötztal looks like a UFO just landed in the Alps.
In winter, it steams from three bowls open to the sky, while in the background, the mountains of the Ötztal rise into the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool rose the pool. collector Meder the smell of chlorine in the nose.
Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, in the Árpád ’ bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba it stinks so strongly of fuel oil that one hardly believes to have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali hydrogen-carbonate-containing healing water, which is almost black and whose silt sticks to your skin as soon as you slide into the pool - a special kind of wellness experience.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful swimming spots: when she wanted to visit the outdoor and sunbathing in the Czech spa Luhatschowitz, she found a fenced off area.
The spa designed by the architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 has since been closed.
When Meder glanced through the weathered windows of the red, white, yellow, Art Nouveau building, she saw weeds growing between the tiles.
The decay was counteracted in an enchanting swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
This bath has already passed three construction phases; you can discover not only neo-Romanesque elements dating back to its construction in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal is the favorite pool of the pool connoisseur Iris Meder - and not only because she originally comes from the Black Forest.
"It's quite an achievement to merge such different styles into such a great unit," says Meder.
With such a palace the dive in the thermal pool is obviously only secondary.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank lets raw material investigate business
By Christian Teevs
Will Deutsche Bank give up its agricultural commodities business?
According to Spiegel Online information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the poor of the world.
In January, the CEO then wants to draw conclusions.
- Hamburg -
For the citizens of Germany, the matter is clear: according to a study, 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate with agricultural commodities such as wheat or maize.
Two-thirds of respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions withdraw from this business, because it exacerbates the problems of the world ’ s poorest.
This is the result of a survey conducted by Forsa on behalf of the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, the author Harald Schumann shows that the bets on the global commodity exchanges drive up prices - and the banks therefore bear a share of the blame for the global hunger problem.
The campaign of the consumer protectors is directed specifically against the boss Josef Ackermann, even if major banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, commodity bets were intended to insure traders against price fluctuations.
But most experts now agree that gamblers have decoupled from supply and demand – making profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike the US competitors, Ackermann reacted to the criticism: he promised to examine the accusations and said that no business was "worth jeopardizing the good reputation of Deutsche Bank".
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the accusations contained in the Foodwatch Report.
The audit should be completed by the end of the year, when the results will be presented to the Board of Management of Deutsche Bank - including a recommendation on how to deal with them.
At the end of January, the bank ’ s top officials will announce the consequences.
The result could be a reduction in commodity business, or even a complete reversal.
Ackermann tinkering with his image
Foodwatch ’ s boss Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time reiterated his criticism of the financial sector: “Betting on rising food prices shows particularly drastically how ruthlessly banks are damaging the common good today. ”
As the highest bank lobbyist, Ackermann now has a special duty.
"Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio that use money to bet on food prices," Bode said.
"Regardless of whether Mr. Ackermann is concerned with people suffering from hunger or with the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann ’ s insight comes as a surprise at first glance, but it is clear that the CEO wants to present a perfect picture a few months before he leaves office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the CEO will not join the Supervisory Board as planned.
By turning away from controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And he hardly needs to worry about possible losses - after all, that is what his successor would have to do.
Every second person would terminate raw material plants
Foodwatch tries to keep up the pressure on the manager.
More than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the organisation's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute interviewed 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
According to this, only eleven percent consider it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments in which they bet on food prices.
Many bank customers would also face personal consequences if they were to learn that their bank is involved in such transactions: according to the survey, one in two would cancel all investments that involve money in commodity speculation.
43 per cent would advise acquaintances against such a bank, 49 per cent indicated to consider to quit their account and to change to another institute.
21er Haus in Vienna
The Moved Pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with ups, downs and happy endings: The Austrian world exhibition pavilion in Brussels won prizes in 1958, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and dilapidated.
Now it is being reopened as an exhibition venue.
When modern post-war architecture is raved about, about clear forms, glass halls, courageous curves and new building materials, which are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels World Exhibition in 1958 is an apt and famous example.
At that time, Schwanzer's pavilion was awarded the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and floating steel, the glass construction.
The building is still considered a milestone in contemporary architecture.
He made the architect so famous that he also built Austria ’ s pavilion at the next world exhibition.
In 1973, he finally became internationally famous with his legendary four-cylinder BMW plus bowl-like extension in Munich.
His pavilion, which was planned as a temporary exhibition building, was erected after the World Exhibition in the Swiss Garden at Vienna ’ s Südbahnhof station, rebuilt and opened in 1962 as a museum of the 20th century – the “House of the Twenties ”.
But the building was not suitable as a spatial and technical museum - no walls for hanging art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until the contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001, the building stood empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, which is now called "21er Haus" and will in future be used as a museum for contemporary art.
On Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the building belongs, opens the first exhibition there - a stroke of luck in every respect.
In 2007, Agnes Husslein became the new director of the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere.
She earned her doctorate in art history with a remarkable career in her youth as a figure skater, later at Sotheby ’ s, the Guggenheim Museum, and as the founding director of the Museum der Moderne Salzburg. She pushed through the renovation with politicians and conservationists, obtained public funds and private sponsors, and determined the use of the building.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba were to be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, there was to be a café and a bookshop, and an office building had to be built for this purpose.
Strict supervision, small budget
Krischanitz was the ideal cast for the performance.
Not only because he sensitively converted and expanded Joseph Olbrichs Secession in Vienna and won the competition, but also because he studied with Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was a "tremendously important place" for him, where he had seen the exhibitions "almost every weekend".
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost its generosity and lightness when it was moved to Vienna and converted.
There were far greater problems with the current conversion: the building was "an energy centrifuge", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass façade were replaced, glass fibre reinforced insulating glass was used and the glass roof was replaced by special safety glass.
Cold bridges ， steel beams have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been rehabilitated.
Two basements provided space for the new use, a lowered light trench between the house and the street provides the lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house is painted in the old rust-brown color.
And the cinema hall is even exactly as it used to be.
And all this under strict supervision of the monument authority and with a small budget.
"Often a material had to be found that is good and cheap and that the office of monument protection liked," says Krischanitz, pointing to a rough ground in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and alterations, the building has remained flexible and light.
It was difficult with the pavilion, "that came from Brussels", Krischanitz has recently said, a typical "Drop in the city history".
Such an architecture stands "always in the wrong place" and nevertheless wants to "awaken a real consciousness".
In this case, however, the 21er Haus is not in the wrong place, because an urban development stroke of luck has occurred: around the Swiss garden, the completely redesigned "Hauptbahnhofsquartier" with office and residential buildings is under construction.
And another stroke of luck may yet occur: the 21er Haus could receive reinforcement from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Temporäre Kunsthalle in Berlin, and one hears that she is already negotiating with the city for a neighbourly location in the Swiss Garden.
Bahn plans winter crisis in million package
Rail has devised a plan to prevent train cancellations in the winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter-conditioned cancellations of trains and delays the German course spends according to a newspaper report in this year over 70 million euro additionally.
The "Bild" newspaper reported in advance, citing an intra-group crisis plan, that investments totalling around 300 million euros are planned by 2015.
The aim is to achieve better availability of vehicles and rail networks even in extreme weather.
Among other things, it is planned to double the number of internal and external employees for the removal of snow from railways and platforms to 16,000.
The aim is to free platforms from snow and ice within four to five hours until the start of operation and 90 percent of the necessary switches.
Two months ago, after a high-level meeting with the government and industry, Railway Chief Rüdiger Grube had warned of cancellations and delays this winter.
Last winter, the railways encountered considerable problems in passenger transport, due to a lack of reserves, including in difficult weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for approval from the Federal Railway Authority for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
For years, the railway has also been struggling to get the axles of ICE trains inspected significantly more frequently in the workshop after an ICE train in Cologne main station had an axle break.
Deutsche Bank Pays Million Sentence in the United States
After the turmoil surrounding boss Josef Ackermann, new hardships come from the USA: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million fine there.
As if the problems at home were not enough for Deutsche Bank, the industry giant is now also catching up with its past in the US: in a comparison, the Frankfurt institute is paying 145 million dollars (106 million euros) to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It concerns the sale of mortgage securities.
The financial market regulator NCUA accuses a number of large banks of having misled the cooperative banks with false promises to buy the financial products; they have played down the risks.
Such securities fell sharply in value during the financial crisis, dragging banks down with them.
"We are pleased that we were able to resolve the issue without the parties having to go to court," said a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York.
The bank did not admit any guilt with the settlement.
The same is true of Citigroup, which committed $20.5 million.
The NCUA Chair Debbie Matz welcomed the kindness of the two Houses of Commerce.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the US cooperative banks and intervenes in case of bankruptcies in order to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to get the billion dollar damages repaid.
The now concluded comparisons are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also picked up on other big banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
The mortgage securities in question are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on home loans.
When the US housing bubble burst in 2007, it doomed a multitude of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, US investment bank Lehman Brothers overturned.
Even if events have been going on for a few years, the banks in the US are currently facing a sharp wind.
Investors and regulators have filed innumerable lawsuits to obtain redress or punish misconduct.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest wave of lawsuits.
It accuses 18 major international banks of having taken advantage of the two US government-owned property financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage transactions worth around $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank, too, must face up to a complaint from the FHFA, which deals with several transactions worth a total of 14.2 billion dollars from the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires that the Frankfurters pay for 'substantial losses', but without specifying an exact sum.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unfounded and declared that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett joins IBM with $10 billion
Finanzguru Buffett invests heavily in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has bought shares worth more than $10 billion.
Until now, the great American investor Warren Buffett had always declared that he did not invest in IT and computer companies, because it was difficult to predict the long-term development of the companies.
Now, however, he has read the IBM annual reports and changed his mind about investments in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM mainly provides services and computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is regarded as a knighthood in the financial world.
As a result, IT is now allowed to call IBM "Sir IBM".
For Buffett has now revealed in CNBC that he has been buying IBM stock worth $10.7 billion since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has thus become one of IBM ’ s largest shareholders with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that even IBM didn't know anything about the engagement so far.
He praised the management, which had still made good profits even during the economic crisis.
"They did a great job," Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has relied for some time on the lucrative IT ’ s services such as the operation of data centers.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful company computers.
Buffett had avoided technology companies until then.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he understands.
Instead, Buffett resorted to a freight railway, a lubricant, or manufacturers or machine builders.
In addition to around 80 of its own subsidiaries, its holding company Berkshire Hathaway also owns shares in a whole range of major corporations such as Coca ’ Cola and Munich Re, the former Munich Re.
The 81-year-old took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and, with clever investments, developed it into one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Yet his lifestyle is modest.
It is therefore for innumerable investors in all world a cult figure.
His almost unmistakable sense for making money earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
After the announcement of Buffett Investments IBM ’ s stock rose pre-trade by one percent.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also known, is worth more than 220 billion dollars on the stock exchange, making it one of the most valuable technology companies in the world, along with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, he didn ’ t want to join.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is palpable
After the uncovering of the "Zwickauer cell" Turkish media doubt the German constitutional state.
One newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology" that is now reviving.
The murders of eight Turkish-born and one Greek entrepreneur between 2000 and 2006 had a far-right background.
This news is reacted to in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany with fear and concern.
Since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence against Turks with a right-wing extremist background.
That there is xenophobia in Germany was nevertheless never in question.
The far-right network revealed, however, reveals dimensions whose dimensions are far from foreseeable.
"Is the bloody ideology reviving?" was the headline of the internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah", on the other hand, stresses that one of the perpetrators is said to have been a "V" man of constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities may also be involved in the radical right-wing swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted calmly: at the weekend, it commemorated the victims of racist violence with a vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
Just two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had commemorated the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In cheerful colors the togetherness had been staged - as a story of success.
The reports of some Turkish media seem like a slap in the face: "Germany's gift for the fiftieth" reads the headline of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which reports on the background of the murder series.
Also the Germany edition of the "Hürriyet" does not miss to draw this mental connection.
"It starts to stink", is the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He emphasizes that people were murdered, that they paid taxes and that their work made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
The procedure of the police and their later search success is discussed extremely critically in GermanTurkish Internet forums.
The authors are surprised why the German authorities have not come up with the idea of looking for suspects in far-right circles.
Some are at least rhetorically ready for drastic means: "If we continue to slog here, the migrants have no choice but to defend themselves and arm themselves."
"This will probably be the best self-protection."
"Internal peace in Germany depends very much on the goodness of the enlightenment and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network," writes Selen.
The attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the nineties made clear what it means when internal peace in Germany is in danger.
The photo of the fire ruins of Solingen is deeply rooted in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event showed the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that mistrust and distance can lead to right-wing violence.
The attacks, however, sharpened the "we" feeling on the Turkish side.
Don't repeat the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press at the time criticised the failure of German politics after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the arson attack in Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolence to the Turkish President, but was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel listed in his speech at that time, how many royalties the local Turks were paying.
It is as if the value of a person is calculated according to the level of his taxes.
The current reporting by the Turkish media shows once again how deep the mistrust of many German Turks in the local rule of law has been ever since.
Along with efforts to comprehensively enlighten and reassess far-right terrorism in Germany, we need frank words this time around.
The Scandal Bank of Lake Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not located in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS went almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since been sliding from one crisis to the next.
Now it is to judge a German.
Axel Weber surely did not think so.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank, it was announced in July that he would take up an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the major Swiss bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber publicly rejoiced, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newfound solidity, and dropped friendly remarks about his future colleagues.
"UBS has achieved the turnaround".
"I am looking forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
But as early as September, it became clear that everything would be very different.
A UBS dealer in London had bypassed all of the bank ’ s security systems and gambled around €1.7 billion.
UBS ’ s CEO Oswald Grübel, a famous banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the Chairman of the Board of UBS has also been regarded as unwell - and everyone is asking: When will Axel Weber finally arrive?
It has already become known that Weber will be able to advise the Bank from February 2012.
And he will take over the chairmanship of the Board as early as May - not just in 2013, as the Bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber it will be tough.
He is not a banker, but a professor of economics and a central banker, and would certainly have needed a period of familiarisation.
At a stroke, he assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has just proved once again that it has long since earned the title of 'Europe's largest scandalous bank'.
Because on the one hand UBS is huge - until recently it was the world's largest asset manager - and on the other hand it has been sliding from one scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, is spared the once so proud Swiss bank.
It began in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
She had combined the image of the secretive and solid, but also sophisticated Swiss asset manager with ambitious goals: She wanted to become a major player in investment banking.
In 2007, for example, UBS managed $1.6 trillion more money-rich customers than any other bank in the world.
And, on the other hand, it had advanced as an investment bank into the league of the world ’ s largest banks.
That made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and later a long-standing professor of banking in Zurich, recounts: "At that time I always presented UBS to my students as a model of a good bank."
"From today's point of view, one wonders: How could I be so wrong?"
He was very wrong.
In 2007, it was first revealed that something had gone badly wrong in UBS.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffli, who had hitherto been regarded as a highly intellectual and equally brilliant banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, one sensed why he had left.
The investment division of the bank had gambled with subprime and had to write off billions.
To shoulder this burden, UBS announced a CHF13 billion capital increase.
But it did find investors, but some that some would have sniffed at until shortly before: an opaque Asian sovereign wealth fund from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth fund that was so secretive that it didn ’ t even get its name.
But that was only the first blow.
In April 2008, things got worse.
The bank had to announce new losses worth billions, and the chairman of the board, Marcel Ospel, who in 2006 was the second-best paid board member in Switzerland, resigned.
The catastrophe followed in October 2008: UBS was on the verge of collapse and had to be saved by the state due to its bad investments in the financial crisis.
The National Bank bought tens of billions of problematic securities from UBS, while the Swiss Confederation paid six billion francs for a compulsory convertible bond, which enabled it to become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked - because it noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it hosts such large banks.
After all, UBS ’ s balance sheet total in 2007 was more than five times Switzerland ’ s economic performance (see chart).
"Once again, we could not save UBS," says banking researcher Geiger.
The first disaster was followed by the second.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with America, agreeing to disclose the data of wealthy clients who may have evaded taxes with the bank ’ s help.
It also agreed to pay $780 million to repay unwarranted profits from these deals, including a penalty.
Thus, UBS more or less openly acknowledged having helped with tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in the competition for rich customers: the aura of secrecy.
After the scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the Chairman and Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customer funds.
Within a few months, the bank had lost credibility in both key areas: investment banking through misguided speculation and asset management through tax evasion assistance.
And just when things got a little quieter again, just when it was thought that UBS would be able to do it again, this unfortunate dealer story follows: A single dealer gambles 1.7 billion euros before the bank realizes that something is going wrong.
And it is becoming obvious that risk management in investment banking is still not working.
“With the Adoboli case, it has become clear that too little has changed in terms of risk control, ” says Martin Janssen, economist and professor of finance at the University of Zurich ’ s banking institute.
The CFO of a major German bank is also certain: "The problem with UBS is that it does not have risk control under control."
Yet it was precisely the idea of caution with which the Swiss bankers long ago set out to become guardians of the world ’ s great fortunes: no too great risks, but security for the money – even beyond the Alpine republic the world might collapse.
The safes of the Swiss banks had become a symbol of unshakable reliability, like Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly fine chocolate.
The head office of UBS in Zurich still fits the cliché of the dignified Swiss private bank - it is just a bit bigger.
The location is classic.
The bank is headquartered on Zurich ’ s Bahnhofstrasse, which leads directly from the main railway station to Lake Zurich, surrounded by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are magnificent, the shop rents are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers such as Tiffany's can be found here between traditional Swiss shops such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
Swiss banks have resided here for centuries: from the National Bank and the Palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Baer.
The reception hall of the UBS is entered through a heavy revolving door.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, in front of them there are thick leather armchairs, next to the Bench Logo there is a large sign to the "Safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for: security.
However, both major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, eventually suppressed this idea of the Swiss bank – or betrayed it, as the head of a small Swiss private bank thinks.
He would rather not read his name in the newspaper because, like all Swiss bankers, he also does business with the two big banks.
UBS has become far too big, he finds - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have also spread.
The Swiss would have nothing more to say there.
"And if they do, they have long since adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
Indeed, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, yielding first big profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the big Swiss bank.
The disaster became visible on October 15, 2008.
"On that Wednesday, the ruling coalition of the small country of seven million decided on the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation," writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS Crash".
The politicians approved up to 68 billion Swiss francs, or around 45 billion euros, in order to rescue the major bank that was about to go bankrupt.
How did this come about?
When talking to Swiss bankers, they see the problem mainly in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged to form a huge corporation.
A bank was formed that was already too big for small Switzerland at the time of the merger - and continued to grow.
It helped that UBS ’ s two different predecessors complemented each other: a rich but sleepy bank with a focus on wealth management in Zurich, and a poorer but already more internationalized one.
Suddenly, internationalized investment bankers came up with a lot of cheap money to spin a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says banking researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high-intellectual, modest, who knows a lot about models and statistics, and Ospel, the belly man, who has worked his way up from the banking doctrine to the very top."
But in the end Ospel relied on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake in the end: “He thought that his models were the reality, ” says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragically, perhaps.
It is clear: arrogance came before the fall.
UBS employees clearly remember the executives of the meetings at which CEO Wuffli repeatedly gave the same slogan: get Goldman Sachs off the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She led the League Tables, the rankings that documented the success of the banks of the time.
That is where UBS wanted to go, to the very top.
She had already taken a few steps.
In foreign exchange and stock trading, she played at the top.
However, management consultants who were appointed highlighted a weakness: in the international interest business, in the bankers' language "Fixed Income", there was a huge distance to the largest banks.
UBS has gaps in US mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost her her existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and a pre-established hedge fund invested in American subprime assets.
It became a huge machine, packaging and passing securities on to American mortgage loans, but also retaining risks.
Even when other banks were already looking for an exit.
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was in flames, UBS bought there," says Geiger, a banking expert.
So great is the euphoria, so deep is the fall.
One manager after another had to leave, as the attempts to clean up turned out to be more difficult than expected.
Items at UBS have become ejection seats and remain wobbly to this day.
Whoever now runs the big bank has an almost impossible job.
He must find a strategy for a bank that has lost all the obvious business models.
Banking researcher Geiger already has an idea: No more investment banking, concentration on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank does not want to go that far (yet).
But investment banking is set to shrink sharply, that much is already clear.
Next Thursday, the new bank manager Sergio Ermotti will present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was actually only intended as a temporary solution when the bank surprisingly parted ways with its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has established himself: he is to run the business of UBS on a permanent basis, the Zurich bank announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants the investment bank to go back to the mid-nineties.
He cuts 3500 posts.
But that will not be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
How does she want to make money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is already asking himself.
So far, he has only publicly said that he and his wife would first look for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe burdens US stock market
The looming recession in Europe has taken the courage away from US investors at the start of the week.
The changes of government in Athens and Rome remained without force.
Slowed industrial production on the continent stifled hopes of stabilizing the debt crisis.
The general relief over the changes of government in Rome and Athens could not prevail.
The euro fell against the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek glass was still considered half full, not half empty - but now the problems have come to the fore again, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
Above all, financial assets were on the sales slips.
At the close of the trade, the Dow ’ s Jones ’ Index of Default Values decreased by 0.6 percent to 12,078 points.
Over the course of trade, the market barometer fluctuated between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The S & P ’ s broader 500% index ended at 1251 points, a drop of one percent.
The index of the technology exchange Nasdaq lost 0.8 percent and went out of business with 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax dropped by 1.2 percent at 5985 points.
The industry in the 17 Euro countries has significantly reduced their production and is preparing for the end of the boom.
The companies produced two percent less in September than in the previous month, according to the statistical office Eurostat.
US investors were skeptical: "We are not an island, we are dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
He said that Europe would not be able to extricate itself quickly from a recession and that there were other signs of weakness in the banks.
Investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: it is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything it can to end the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
In his view, it is therefore too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett overthrew a decades-old principle and entered the US technology industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM bolstered the traditional company ’ s share price and, contrary to the trend in the course of trade, made it initially quote just under one percent higher.
The paper closed almost unchanged at 187.35 dollars.
Buffett has paid an average of 170 dollars per piece and now holds 5.5 percent.
His investment firm, Berkshire Hathaway, lost 1.3% of its share price.
At 2.6 percent, Bank of America ’ s share certificates declined significantly more than the market.

On Nasdaq, with revenues of 1.38 billion shares, 630 were up, 1913 negative and 82 unchanged.
Smart crows are spreading in cities
In many places, rooks are regarded as "problem birds". Experts claim that these highly intelligent animals can no longer be driven out of cities.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly: crows have been part of the cityscape for centuries, but in many municipalities residents complain about the dirt and noise of the animals.
A remedy against the "problem birds" is so far not in view.
Rooks are impossible to get out of the cities, experts said at the first crow symposium in the East Frisian city of Leer.
There specialists from the entire federal territory discussed possible ways out.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
Conservationists attributed the problems in cities to the rural exodus of the particularly protected rooks: the use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional habitats.
Hunting, increasing cultivation and the felling of typical breeding trees made life difficult for the birds.
Crows are protected.
Large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs exist, among others, in the Westphalian Soest, in the northwest, among others, in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen, as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project for the mass killing of crows in the county made headlines there.
Critics had described the catching of animals in bird traps and the killing with batons as particularly brutal.
The urban and landscape planner Werner Klöver from Leer has stated: "The normal expulsion, the agitation, is useless."
Splashing nests away with water or felling trees often has undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals evade, large colonies split up and spread elsewhere."
Scare is conceivable only as an exception at hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them away."
Without the surrounding countryside the problem in the cities cannot be solved, meant mayor Wolfgang waiter from empty.
A combination of agitating the animals from sensitive living areas and attraction offers is conceivable, in order to settle them in other places again.
In contrast, psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens called for "information boards instead of chainsaws" in order to treat animals in a completely different way: "After all, we can best endure a pimple in the face with confidence."
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberg crows "nature trail" in Schleswig-Holstein, where signs inform about the life of the highly intelligent rooks.
The project has already been accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also had his own opinion on the criticism of the noise of birds: "There is a lot of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and dexterity of the animals are legendary: Rooks not only use tools to get a treat, but they even make their own tools.
Behavioural researchers at Cambridge University recently tested the intelligence of birds on four rooks.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to use stones to bring down a scaffold in order to reach a moth larva.
Without much training, they determined what size and shape a stone must have in order to cause the platform to collapse.
In a second attempt the smart crows had to solve a tricky problem.
The researchers placed a small bucket with a moth larva in a vertically positioned cylinder.
With the beak, the birds could not reach its loot.
However, the researchers had put pieces of wire to them.
From this all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they then caught the bucket on the handle out of the tube.
Three of the four rooks succeeded even at first attempt.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal to the European Championship 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks for a coup failed.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and also Ireland will take part in the Euro 2012.
Portugal, Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have solved the last tickets to the European Championship 2012 in Poland and Ukraine in the Play offs.
Led by doubly successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal beat Bosnia and Herzegovina 6-2 (2-1) to complete the fifth consecutive European Championship appearance after the 0-0 from the first leg.
The Czechs were able to score a 1-0 (0-0) in the play-off leg of the outsider Montenegro, after the first leg (2-0) had already been a clear thing.
There was nothing left to burn for Croatia in the 0: 0 against Turkey, Ireland won a loose 1: 1 (1: 0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored further hits for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburger Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a converted trade meter (41.) and captain Emir Spahic (65.) had shortened twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow, red card (54.).
Bosnia had already failed in the play-offs to the 2010 World Cup in South Africa to Portugal.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal got off to a good start.
Ronaldo chased a free kick from around 30 meters into the net for the early lead.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his wide-shot qualities and hit from 25 meters to 2-0.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half hour, had their first clear chance by goal scorer Edin Dzeko.
The former head of the English championship leader Manchester City placed a header on the lower edge of the bar, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek meets for Czech Republic
Afterwards referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding was in the center of attention.
After an attack against Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penalty area, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36th).
On the other side, Stark gave a controversial meter after an action by Fabio Coentrao that Misimovic certainly transformed.
But after the break the Vice European Champion of 2004 made everything clear with four goals.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also finished the last doubts in the 81st minute.
This is the fifth time in a row that the European Champion from 1976 has gone to the European Championships.
However, the team of coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga, legionaries Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nürnberg) was lucky and had to overcome a moment of shock already in the early phase.
Closing man Petr Cech prevented with a reflex at the last moment a possible own goal by Tomas Sivok (9th).
Montenegro had its greatest possibilities when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic was in action.
In the 40th minute from the turn of the penalty area border, Damjanovic just missed the goal of Cech.
After the break the crossbar had to save for the already beaten world-class goalkeeper of the Czechs, again the striker of FC Seoul had moved away (50th).
The goal shortly before the end finally made everything clear.
Turkey meanwhile missed the football miracle of Zagreb.
Four days after the 0: 3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb could not beat a 0: 0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink has to leave his place on the bench of the World Cup 2002 almost certainly, the Croatians can look forward to their fourth participation in a European Championship final.
In front of 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir Stadium the Turks nearly had a dream start.
Selcuk Inan only hit the post in the seventh minute with a shot from a distance, Kazim Kazim could not sink the rebound in goal either.
After the moment of terror, Croatia took more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croats did not burn anything.
Beside Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who made place for the Dortmunder Ivan Perisic from the 62nd minute, also the Bundesliga Legionäre Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were in the field.
Trapattoni goes to the European Championship
In Dublin the Irish celebrated their first European Championship in Germany since 1988.
Stephen Ward brought the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a preliminary decision with the 4-0 victory in the first leg, into the lead in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) compensated for the guests.
Ireland pushed from the beginning, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
It was only at the last minute that the Estonian back team prevented the possible opening goal.
But in the 32nd minute it was time.
After an unsuccessful defence of goalkeeper Pavel Londak Ward was on the spot and pushed the ball over the line to 1-0.

Mass slaughter on a personal level
Peter Englund ’ s new book “Beauty and Horrors. A Story of the First World War Told in Nineteen Destinies ” begins with empathy and generosity, with a long list of protagonists that touches one ’ s heart.
Here ’ s a tip on how to proceed: Cut this page out carefully and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people very well in Englund ’ s novel, and these protagonists will function as your GPS, as a lighthouse in these few moments when you, like Englund ’ s men and women, are lost in the fog of war and bereft of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He has written an unusual book, which he rightly describes as "a work of anti-Semitic history".
It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly any ambassadors, raging reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was." It's about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"Beauty and Horror" is almost the combined war experiences of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go mad or die.
Each of these lives flares up like votive candles in a church, some are added, while others go out.
Englund's book differs from the usual history books.
It also corrects the notion that the First World War was only the devastating war of position on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Terror" wanders with expert view over other war zones: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
On the soldiers in this book fall beehives, one celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, tsetse flies are an insoluble problem.
This is a moving book almost from the beginning.
The war is flooding the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina smelling of cordit.
Imagine you are a woman who is at home with her children and hears cannon fire in the distance. Do you stay or flee?
Who is coming?
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is being waged at all.
"Missing facts", Englund states, "were furnished with assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours."
"Beauty and Terror" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor.
Their stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other previously published material.
Their life stories can be terrifying or poignant, but they are extremely vivid in Englund ’ s collection of little moments lost in detail.
Many of them act of want and help themselves.
In the story of a German schoolgirl, he tells: "Replacement, everywhere replacement."
"Spare coffee, wrong aluminum, wrong eraser, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He tells more about the replacement meal in Germany.
He describes "meat made from pressed rice and baked in mutton fat (and last served with a false bone of wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato skins, shoes soled with wood."
There were, as he notes, "837 registered food substitutes that were permitted in the manufacture of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honour and bravery.
An American recognizes his own drive for savagery and says of the war: "You feel that this is, in spite of everything, what was intended for men rather than sitting in the armchair, with the evening paper or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whiskey in his hand, and to pretend that such a facade signifies civilization and that there is no barbarism behind one's strengthened and padded shirt chest."
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is likely to die and that no one will take notice of it or worry about it.
"When you distance yourself from the idea of sacrificing yourself, you want to think that this happens in front of an audience," he writes.
Instead, it is as terrible as "a condemned man who was secretly hanged."
Other observations deal with old Europe falling apart and new forms of terror.
“The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition, ” writes Englund,“ a war between factories. ”
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the young century": "the eloquent and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a tailor-made suit who slaughters while sitting behind a desk."
Humans behave in unforeseen ways, and there is frivolous behavior as well as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to contract venereal disease from a prostitute in order to escape the front-line service.
"The grotesque expression of this can be found in the trade in gonococcal pus, because soldiers bought and smeared on their genitals in the hope of getting to the hospital," he writes.
"Those who were really desperate rubbed him in the eyes, causing them to be blind the rest of their lives."
In this translation from Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund ’ s poetry becomes supple yet unobtrusive and adapts perfectly to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he captures the way the war "unleashed uncontrollable forces in a unique way: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about the First World War were mostly more falsified like Paul Fuss's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarque's "Nothing New in the West" than extensive history books.
Englund ’ s band joins an unconventional hall of fame.
His book has the most devastating ending I have ever read about in a nonfiction book.
I won't give it away anymore.
But it is as if with his book he snatched away this page with the main characters in front of his nose and lit it with a match.
After an early misstep a meticulously planned assault
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing helmets.
The decision was made for the night from Monday to Tuesday, because there were hardly any people in Zucotti Park at that time.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-ranking officials were informed. Initially, everyone else believed they were participating in an exercise.
Police chief Raymond W. Kelly was in their midst, and his presence underscored the fact that the operation was fraught with challenges.
The incidents of recent weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violated the rules of the department and gave the squatters an enormous increase in public sympathy, must not be repeated.
And so the police action to remove the protesters from Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared these by observing how occupations were handled in other cities.
A disaster drill had taken place with a view of Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials stepped up so-called chaos training – counter-terrorism measures, including the rapid relocation of large numbers of police officers – to focus on lower Manhattan.
The last training session took place on Monday night on Manhattan ’ s East River side.
The order to move into the park came "at the last minute," said someone familiar with the orders, which spoke of a declaration as "exercise."
“The few policemen I know who were involved didn ’ t know that it was about Zuccotti Park, ” said someone who wanted to remain anonymous.
"The only ones who knew that it was about Zuccotti Park were the high-ranking officials of the department."
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, officials wanted to leave the park, but then backed away when hundreds of protesters gathered after learning of these plans.
Officials from various police units participated in Tuesday ’ s operation, including task forces from across the city – hundreds of mobile officers normally deployed in highly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day many people come in and out of the park, almost like commuters, so 1 am at night is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do so when the least number of people were in the park," he said.
Ambulances with Jupiter lamps and speakers were waiting at Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the pre-recorded messages that roared from the loudspeakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
When the public officials entered the park in their light blue wind jackets, many protesters simply gathered their belongings and left the place.
The police said that no tents would be touched until 1: 45 a.m. to give the protesters time to pack their belongings.
Other teams of officials were seen rallying around to intervene should arrests be necessary in the park.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman for the police chief, said it was for their own safety.
But many journalists claim that they wanted to prevent them from watching the police actions in the park, and they said that the treatment of the officials was very rough.
Mr Browne said that TV cars could have taken photos on Church Street on the west side of the park.
When the police moved westward through the big mess of protesters ’ personal belongings, including suitcases, artificial turf, and bags of clothes, they were followed by city cleaners, who picked up what had been left behind.
Some protestors who refused to leave were dragged out. Pictures of this appeared on the Internet a short time later.
A major nucleus of protesters took up position near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park.
Some erected barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests.
About 10 people in the epicentre of the camp tied themselves together by their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Civil protection officials have been summoned to cut them off.
As Mr Kelly said, no arrests were made in the park until about 3: 30.
The eviction was completed after 75 minutes, according to the police.
Mr. Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests, he said, were due to 'undue behaviour and opposition to arrest'.
The most prominent local official was Joseph J. Esposito, the chief of the detachment, the highest uniformed officer of the detachment.
Phil T. Pulaski, chief of department of the detectives, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr Kelly 'did not lead the operation', as Mr Browne said.
In the event that they should access, a second group of officials waited on the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block further south.
It was possible to observe how from these locations the police expanded the perimeter more and more around Zuccotti Park.
In one place it was observed how several officials, many of them with protective shields, drove people outside.
Approximately 28 people were in the northern periphery.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
At 5am, south of Pine Street, a protestor jumped onto the roof of a police car and other demonstrators let the air out of the tire of a police bus.
In one place the crowd threw a piece of plywood.
In the end, an official and a protestor came to the hospital.
Union of caregivers will file suit against the city for dismissals
The union, representing hundreds of school workers who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday because the dismissals are unnecessary and discriminatory due to their inadequate impact on the schools that teach poor students.
The lawsuit is probably the last option still open to the union, District Council 37, in its efforts to reverse the dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, care coordinators, and other employees who were among the city ’ s lowest-paid employees, and who lost their jobs in a maneuver on October 7, described by union leaders as a political revenge for denying the city last year access to a health fund run by the working groups to fill the budget gap.
This accusation was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a City Council hearing last month, Dennis M. Walcott, director of schools, said the dismissals were part of the budget that was passed in June.
A city council member shot back and told him that nothing in the budget specified that school aid workers would be laid off.
City Council officials 37 said they had and warned the Ministry of Education about a lawsuit. On Wednesday there will be a press conference where the filing of the lawsuit before the Supreme Court in Manhattan will be formally announced.
The lawsuit will list Mr. Walcott and the city ’ s Department of Education as defendants, and count eight dismissed workers as plaintiffs, all of whom are colored or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesperson for the city ’ s Department of Justice, said that the city did not have the lawsuit before it, so their individual claims could not be commented on.
According to a lawsuit drafted by the New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs in schools in the city ’ s slums to support a lawsuit for inequality, claiming that poor schools have lost more helpers because they are chronically underfunded.
It states that while there were no redundancies on Staten Island and only a few redundancies in the schools of the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school helpers in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 helpers in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx were made redundant.
In noting the loss of five out of eight school helpers employed at Harlem ’ s public school, 36, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the complaint says, “This is not a neighborhood of well-heeled parents who can organize donations to help meet budget cuts. ”
P.S.: The 36th district budget was cut by 3.26% this year, and funds were lost when the city changed its method of calculating extra financing for each poor school enrolment.
The union also deplores that the leaders of the high schools were misled by the language in a memo that approved the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even though "excess" in the United States usually describes the change of a teacher from a school payroll to a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six care coordinators were dismissed, not transferred," says the draft complaint.
Mission completed, Congress ready to agree on Libya
It looks, after all, that Republicans and Democrats in Washington are already in agreement about the Libyan uprisings.
All that was needed was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of long-time dictator Muammar Qaddafi, and an end to American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate Committee on International Relations passes a resolution headed by John Kerry (Massachussetts), together with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libya for the successful rebellion and US troops for their "courage".
"This resolution pays tribute to the courageous Libyans who have begun rebuilding their country," Kerry said.
"It is a confirmation of the support of two parties for their democratic efforts."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in Libya ’ s debate.
This summer, lawmakers of both parties and the White House argued over the wording of a series of resolutions approving or disapproving of the role of the US military in NATO ’ s Libya mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution authorizing the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a broad fringe of both parties and there was no vote.
However, on the same day, the bill failed in the Senate and the Chamber overruled a decision to cut the funds for American operations in Libya.
As a result, the U.S. Mission fell into a kind of legislative purgatory, with a Congress that was indignant enough to criticize Obama ’ s approach to the mission, but not angry enough to pull the rug out from under his feet.
Then the indecision of Congress was overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell under Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
NATO ’ s mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and exceptional perseverance in self-liberation" and "praises the men and women of the U.S. military and their coalition partners who support military operations to protect the people of Libya for their exceptional courage and professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition of Libya to democracy".
Will the new measures receive the full support of the Foreign Relations Panel, or will they divide legislators, as the June law did?
The latest version meets with opposition from Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the committee ’ s top Republican.
Lugar's spokesman said Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Capitol, it is up to the Senate this week to vote on a constitutional amendment calling for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every congressional legislature of the Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures under the leadership of Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or any other area that is currently coming to a vote in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far tried unsuccessfully to put their amendments to the vote, although they have tried often enough.
Goodlatte ’ s amendment is just one of 68 constitutional amendments presented to this Congress, covering a wide range of issues.
Some are double - the same law was presented to both Congress and Senate - others are only slightly different.
There are at least 15 versions of the balancing budget amendment in the Senate alone, and another dozen that would “control federal spending. ”
Some of the laws are identical, but they give their clients - especially novice Republicans who want to brush up their curriculum vitae - the opportunity to brag that they have "written" such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, adopted in August, requires both the Senate and Congress to vote on a change to the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of Congress can submit, while the Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to lift the limit of two presidential terms.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that, among other things, guarantee the right to good education and health care.
A change prohibiting same-sex marriage, like a change prohibiting the burning of flags, is a recurring template.
Some legislators also want to make it possible to repeal federal laws if two-thirds of the states reject them.
As eager as Members propose changes, they move much faster than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress legislators introduced 77 such amendments. In the 110th Congress 66.
The pace pales in comparison to the early 1990s, when members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, according to the numbers provided by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful than today ’ s.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to Congress as early as 1789.
"Hit, but not defeated", said Giffords in the first TV interview after the assassination attempt
Ten months after an armed man shot her at close range during an election rally in Tucson, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on national television on Monday night, singing alone to Broadway ’ s "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow," saying that the desire to recover was greater than to return to Congress.
When she appeared with Diane Sawyer in the ABC "20 / 20" news, she struggled for words and needed help walking.
The broadcast showed the severe slow recovery from the damage done by the bullet that split her skull, pierced the left side of her brain and traversed her head from front to back.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to Congress to vote triumphantly on the debt brake.
In her first television interview after the January attack, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - describing her recovery as "difficult."
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41) replied: "Very well."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20 / 20" special recorded shortly before the release of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope."
The special follows Gifford ’ s recovery since the January 8 assassination attempt.
In videos, which Kelly had recorded in the first weeks, one sees her in the hospital bed, with shaved head and a long scarf over the forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair while therapists show her how to perform simple movements.
A nod with the head.
A twitch with the lips.
And then, their first words: "What."
After a few days Giffords whispers another word: "Toast". She wants her breakfast to be changed.
Videos shown on the ABC show show show that music played an important role in Giffords' recovery: you can see the Congressman singing along with the therapists to Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin '".
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours a day on therapy, said that she can ’ t remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband said that he had read Giffords an article about the assassination on March 12, when she interrupted him and asked for the first time about the six people killed during the assassination.
The alleged shooter Jared Lee Loughner sits in a jail in Missouri and is forcibly medicated while awaiting trial.
"Many people have died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
In the course of his wife's recovery, said Kelly Sawyer, she said, "I was hit."
"Well, I would say:" Gabby, you were not defeated "?", Kelly said.
You were just hit.
And you will get through this and you will recover and you will come back stronger than ever before.
Troops feel more compassion than respect
The event was a "Wall Street" gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
A hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines gathered around him.
The crowd in black tuxedos stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the fundraising campaign in the spring.
A high-ranking military officer at the gala, who was watched by the chief of staff and then chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced like orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I am sure the organisers meant well.
I know that.
But it was no respect, really not. It was pity.
The crass contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the mostly distanced, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are showered with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its price, say employees.
Public opinion is increasingly behaving as if it is suffering people in uniform.
"We were by no means victims," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But apparently the only way of support is to force us into the role of unhappy souls."
The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or at odds with the public they serve.
They also recognized that the anger at the returning troops in the final years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, discussions take place between war veterans about compassion in silence and private matters.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would view it with a sense of awe, having defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there is a "furious, violent veteran under the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to a senior state post in Washington.
While looking for work, he said, he sensed that some of the interviewees were subtly asking if he was able to withstand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington immediately upon his return from the struggle.
"When you talk about your ministry, you must resist the negative impressions," Cancian told his sons.
The military ’ s lack of lightness is rooted partly in Americans ’ lack of interest in the war.
Battlefield achievements are rarely singled out as praise by a country that has little military experience and sees little use in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value military heroism as was the norm in World War II," said retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public is largely focused on the suffering of a public official.
Troops are recognized for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the severity of their injuries.
Military faces growing pressure to crack down on rape
This week, an important hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will be charged with non-intervention in a rape case before the military tribunal.
If this does not happen, hundreds of plaintiffs will be available for the next hearing.
Lieutenant Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and was 11 weeks pregnant when she was raped by a soldier colleague at night.
It was October 2008, and she was returning to her barracks in Miramar, north of San Diego, from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague who was carrying a pack of 12 beers.
He asked her if he would accompany her to her room for a drink.
"My alarm bells went off," said Lyman.
But the Texan woman wiped her concerns aside.
I thought, "Oh, he's 19.
He is from Texas, "she said.
"I wish I had listened to my gut feeling."
A few minutes after they went into Lyman ’ s room, the man stepped behind them, pushed them down and raped them, she claims.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel are anxiously awaiting a trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, to decide whether to allow a lawsuit they filed against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, to go to trial.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld did not address widespread rape within the military, in violation of soldiers ’ constitutional rights.
In February, filed by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the complaint initially included 17 plaintiffs, but increased to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men, all of whom claim to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers, and that the military failed to investigate, convict, or provide proper justice following the alleged attacks.
Burke says she is pursuing the supreme military leadership, as the problem begins there.
"The military is hierarchical," she says.
“Who are the individuals who are in a position to eradicate the culture ’ s retaliation? The leadership. ”
Burke also says that she has contacted nearly 400 more survivors since February, many of whom may be part of future lawsuits.
Their strategy: Instead of all the plaintiffs putting their eggs in a basket, so to speak, they will, if necessary, file many more lawsuits to keep up the pressure.
The Defence team for the Ministry of Defence, led by Attorney Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court files available to Newsweek detail the defense strategy, primarily that the military cannot be charged by current or former soldiers for violations that have occurred in the armed forces.
Due to a law of the Supreme Court from 1950, the so-called Feres' Doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries inflicted on soldiers in active service.
"The alleged damages occurred during the military service of the plaintiffs," says the document.
The Ministry of Defense refuses to comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in battle, the distinction lies solely in the name: modern wars seldom have clear fronts.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers are playing an increasingly important role, especially in establishing contact with indigenous women in war zones.
The result: between these two wars, 150 female soldiers died, two-thirds of them in combat.
It is time to modernise the military, says Burke.
And she is not alone in her struggle: three other lawsuits besides hers are pending.
At Yale Law School, Veterans' Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic atmosphere.
Independently of this, Vietnam Veterans of America, a non-profit organization, is collecting a case against the military that focuses on diagnosing "personality disorder" that rape victims have received to dismiss them from service - a common course of action, according to activists like Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
Her group filed a complaint in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing her of discriminatory practices in her treatment of entitlements for persons who claimed to have been sexually abused while on duty.
Nine laws were independently submitted to Congress by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties, offering a number of clues.
According to the Ministry of Defence ’ s Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, 3,158 cases of sexual abuse were filed in 2010.
But most abuses are not reported at all, and according to the Pentagon ’ s own estimate, this figure accounts for about 13.5% of the estimated 19,000 cases per year.
The report, published in March, also examines law enforcement rates: in 2010, 20% of recorded cases in the military came to court, only half the number in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke ’ s case describe their attacks as just the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman ’ s case, she reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the attack.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape to a number of policemen, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape set and the blood of her attacker, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge, and during the hearing she was asked about the sex she had with her boyfriend before the assault.
Six people testified as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was ultimately acquitted.
“I still remember the day when the verdict was read, ” says Lyman.
"I thought the contractions would begin. I ran screaming out of the courtroom."
"They took me to the psychiatric ward and I remember when I came out, I said to my commander, 'This was not his procedure. This was my procedure.'"
Lyman was asked to see a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder and declared it incapable of serving.
In January 2010, she was dishonestly released, so she receives no support.
Whether the lawsuit filed by Lyman and the other plaintiffs advances is pure speculation, says John Turley, Professor of Law at the George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he notes: "In my view, they should move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine, which has been criticized since it was challenged for the first time.
Throughout my life, I have been a critic of Feres ’ doctrine.
The military lags behind a decade, because they do not have the same incentive and deterrence that liability entails.
He adds, "The odds are against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things will only change if good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not follow their path, Burke, the plaintiff's attorney, will begin with her hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the military in this regard until there are reforms, ” she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Watch You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many guys who sent their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to having committed a homicide in Norway in July in which 77 people were killed, had his first public hearing in court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time in front of his computer before his attack, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social networks.
After the tragedy this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how to find them?
This is easy - you just have to log in to Facebook.
"We found that it was not difficult to get to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report by the British think tank DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook ’ s personal data hideout is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that researchers simply need to use the site ’ s advertising tool to pinpoint their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy – just as marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett ’ s team found half a million fans of far-right groups across Europe, and then targeted them with add-ons, but instead of linking to a new band or a new dietary product, the add-ons invited users to a survey that asked about their education, attitudes toward violence, and their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - without ever having to leave their office.
“It ’ s quite a new research method, ” says Bartlett.
Some of the results are hardly surprising. Online supporters of far-right groups are mostly young, male, and angry at immigration.
But in a kind of surprising twist, "those who combine their online activism with an offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic, and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screens."
DEMO ’ s work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Idea factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything from health issues to social trends such as likes, text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding on average three content per day, Facebook's "data supernova" is generating a research boom that has increased the number of scientific works with the name of this page in the title by nearly 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you can study through this page people who you normally do not reach with your clipboard on the street.
"If you used to try to interview people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
“They had to inform the party first and it would never have allowed them to enter, ” Bartlett says.
"On Facebook, all this is gone - you go directly to them."
Others say that the site provides a way to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their intoxication on Facebook are significantly more prone to problem drinking than students who were silent on the subject.
Moreno suggests that equal students, such as residential advisors, monitor the site and help a student if they post too many status updates.
“You can ’ t solve a problem if you haven ’ t recognized it, ” Dimitri Christakis, Morenos Ko ’ author and director of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children ’ s Research Institute in Seattle, told the Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children who otherwise would not have been found."
Facebook also constantly taps into the data of its own population.
The site ’ s data team compiled statistics on relationship status and Valentine ’ s Day, voter turnout in the 2010 midterm elections, and a National Fortune Index (primarily using data that only Facebook has access to – masters of digital freedom have long known that the site should make their large database available to others for research purposes.)
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they want to or not. In order to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to expose its own personal data.
But what if Facebook users become part of a survey they don ’ t even know about?
While researchers have strict guidelines on how to collect their data offline, online everything is allowed.
“I don ’ t think many users have even thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles, ” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study of the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As for her, it was just about her and her friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how much of the information in a user profile and in posts is true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things, ” says Selwyn.
Therefore, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research has to deal with the social - and a lot of social life is still going on offline."
"Cold and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik appears before a public court for the first time
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to two mass shootings in which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself as a 'resistance' fighter in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a Templar of Norway," he said in front of a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I object to the Tribunal because you have received your mandate from organisations that support Hassideology and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the laws, but I do not plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused Breivik, who brought a pre-written speech with him, permission to turn to the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered Breivik police to keep him in custody for 12 more weeks, and he has no access to the media for four weeks. He said the authorities will closely control all visits and all correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope of being able to see Breivik in the eye, others wanted confirmation that he was behind bars.
All participated with the aim of closing the door.
"I thought it looked cold and inhuman," a Utoya survivor told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it goes a bit further after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and was calm and professional throughout the hearing, looking journalists and survivors in the eye as he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's bizarre suggestion that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not insane and said there was no evidence that he had accomplices.
It may be pleasing to some that the July 22 attacks were apparently the work of a single extremist, not a group of radicals.
But does this automatically ease the sorrow and confusion that an entire nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't," said a victim's relative.
"It would be so much easier if he did."
7 lessons from the interview with the late Steve Jobs, which was shown in a theatre this week
After Steve Jobs ’ death on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, highlighting engineering genius as a great modern inventor.
But what Apple ’ s fans might find most revealing in the recently rediscovered Jobs ’ interview, which was dusted off this week before special movie screenings in major markets, is how much this creative mind has understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer, and a self-proclaimed hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer who diligently crafted diagrams - a man who believed that many managers suffer from "a disease of thought," "that a really great idea accounts for 90 percent of the work... [but] there is an enormous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995 Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Professional Idiots" about the departure of the personal computer. And he sat together with Jobs for more than an hour, in which they had one of the rare, detailed conversations.
By that time, more than 10 years had passed since jobs had been squeezed out of Apple. And he was already working hard on his new computer company, NeXT, and was looking forward to the widespread adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley's interview was used in technical idiots, he says that the copy templates of the interview were missing on delivery.
It was only after Jobs ’ death that a complete VHS copy was discovered in the director ’ s garage.
This slightly revised footage forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which will be coming to the Landmark Theater this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to abhor in-depth interviews, Jobs appears surprisingly eager to explain his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In the course of the interview there are four longer pauses between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, in which Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts and strives for accuracy.
There are also moments when Jobs ’ perfectionism comes to light when he seems impatient with Cringely ’ s questions and pushes him to respond more quickly to issues or subplots of greater importance.
Taken before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, the Lost Interview appears somehow eerily far-sighted when Jobs evaluates what other companies do right or wrong in his opinion and presents his own vision of the future of the computer.
It is one thing to read posthumous appraisals of Jobs' career, but seeing Jobs here as the eager dreamer on the jump to greatness is something very different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this here, he went off and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the Lost Interview:
How he learned to run a business:
"Throughout the years in business, I always ask," Why are you doing things? "And the answer you always get is," Oh, it's just done like that. "
No one knows why he does what he does. No one in business really thinks about things in detail.
I have noticed that.
Jobs continues his efforts to streamline Apple accounting.
Astonishingly, how costs were recorded - usually starting with "standard costs", which were quantified on the basis of mere assumption and then adjusted with "deviation" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that business costs could be determined down to the smallest detail.
How the Pope was ridiculed:
Jobs talks about the "Blue Box", which he built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which you could sneak into the telephone company and make long-distance calls for free.
Much has been written about the device, but Jobs ’ enthusiasm for describing the Blue Box as an act of self-empowerment is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a paid phone, making a call and then connecting from one AT & T network to another as they loop through as many satellites as possible.
“We sent things around the globe half a dozen times and when you shouted into the phone, it came out in the phone next door a minute later, ” Jobs chuckled.
"We were young and we learned that we could build something ourselves that could control trillions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
The two of us, we didn ’ t know much, but we could build this little thing that can control a gigantic thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don ’ t think there would be Apple without it.
Jobs continues to talk about a glorious prank that Wozniak and he almost pulled off when they called the Vatican in the middle of the night via Blue Box and wanted to talk to the Pope while imitating Henry Kissinger as best they could.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two of them had to laugh before the Pope himself spoke on the phone.
How he fell in love with technology (and called Bill Hewlett unprepared):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute call, Jobs received a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a remarkable impact on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it formed my views on what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Later, Jobs became one of HP ’ s employees who visited the company ’ s research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first desktop computer that was ever produced. ”
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with a brown tube and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on to this machine and write programs for it.
How to improve innovation:
Jobs talks about how to spontaneously invent new products several times in an interview.
Early in his career, when he installed some boards, he was asked by a customer to assemble the whole computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think through both the assembly and the delivery of the finished equipment.
Later at Apple he remembers the problems he had with the development of a computer mouse:
"I remember striking arguments... They shouted at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15. That was incredibly believable.
Over large enterprises, which weaken:
Long before he revived Apple, Jobs foresaw the ways in which so many industrial giants stumbled with their visions and lost control of their shares.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so make a better copier or printer, so what?"
They have the share monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [it ’ s those people] who ultimately run the companies and the product that drives people out of decision making.
The product genius that led to this monopoly position is being eradicated by people who have no concept of good products vs. bad products - craftsmanship necessary.
This happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
You could have been ten times bigger, you could have been Microsoft in the 1990s...
They have taken defeat by victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"There is a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about your subtleties.
You have to vote, certain things you can't do, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5000 things, those concepts, and bring them all together...
In the end it boils down to taste, it boils down to trying to deal with the best stuff that people have created and then trying to bring these things together into what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who worked there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who happened to be the best computer scientists in the world.
Had it not been for the computer industry, they would have done fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of health laws when court accepts case
On the day that the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to discuss the politically divisive issue of whether to hear President Obama ’ s challenge to health laws, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a dinner sponsored by the firm to represent the case in court.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the petitions for consideration.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a lawsuit filed by 26 states against the far-reaching healthcare reform enacted by Congress last year, a law that has become a buzzword for conservative activists across the US.
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, a 5 1 / 2 hour basic discussion is expected in March, the outcome of which is likely to spur the 2012 presidential campaign, which will be in full swing by the time the court ruling is announced.
The lawyer who will stand trial and claim that the law is to be overturned will presumably be Paul Clement, once Attorney General under George W. Bush ’ s administration.
Clement ’ s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies supporting the annual Dinner of Federalist Society, a long-established group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which challenge the law.
A further sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which is enormously involved financially in the result of the process.
The dinner was held in a Washington hotel a few hours after the court deliberated on the case.
Service had among other things Mitch McConnell, the leader of the parliamentary party of the Republicans in the senate and a avowed opponent of the health reform
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges have been attending events of the federalist society for years.
And that does not violate moral rules.
Indeed, judges exempt themselves from the Code of Conduct that governs the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under Principle 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge may participate in benefit events of law related and other organizations, the judge not being a speaker, a guest of honor, or, according to the program, a guest of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms involved in the case, as well as to a firm with a massive financial interest in the case, was sufficient to alert morale and government activists.
"This striking break with morality and the contradiction of the code belies the claims of some judges that the court is following the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges won and dined at a charity event with lawyers with pending trials at the court."
Their actions and support for a fundraising campaign for this event undermine any claim to impartiality and are unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say that they too easily confuse judicial matters with groups that are guided by the order of the day, such as federalist society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
By contrast, conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a state attorney general under Obama ’ s administration when the first legal challenges came before the court of first instance.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw herself from the hearing of the case for bias, as she was too engaged in defending the law to be unbiased.
Kagan makes no attempt to do so.
Boeing lands record order worth 18 trillion dollars
Emirates has ordered 50 two-aisle Boeing 777 aircraft with an option for 20 additional aircraft.
Boeing is also selling six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 trillion.
It is really rare news that a company gets an order for 50 pieces of its products.
But it is a big deal when the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co., and the list price for these 50 aircraft is a record $18 trillion.
Equally unusual is the client of Boeing: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast released Monday, the Chicago company estimates that Middle Eastern airlines will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 trillion over the next 20 years.
At the weekend, Boeing announced its biggest ever order for commercial aircraft, measured by the value of the order: 50 two-course Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer order came from the airline Emirates from Dubai.
The airline also, Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show, has an option to purchase another 20 aircraft, bringing the total list price to $26 trillion.
On Monday, Boeing Oman Air ordered six Boeing 777-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which greatly improves fuel consumption and passenger comfort.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than 1 trillion dollars.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, Morningstar's stock market expert.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East are owned by the oil-producing countries.
So not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but an increase in oil prices, which usually hurts the airlines, as this is one of their biggest costs, is not so damaging, as the country earns a higher oil price.
This is important as they have less tendency than other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders if oil prices rise, Dihora said.
"You have a natural hedge," he said.
The Emirates order confirms Boeing ’ s leading position in the widebody market and helps to keep Airbus ’ s competitor SAS at bay, which is attacking its dominance with the A350.
Boeing ’ s victory at the show comes four months after Airbus announced it would postpone the introduction of the largest A350 to compete directly with the 777 300ER.
The introduction was postponed to gain more confidence after customers demanded a higher payload and range.
Boeing ’ s stock increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
Sister of the Mexican President seemingly loses election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims to have supported the drug trafficker opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race for the governor's post.
President Felipe Calderon's sister appears to have lost her bid to become Governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections, claiming on Monday that drug traffickers had influenced the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI, has won the race for governorship in the western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process, and especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview the day after Sunday's election.
"They threatened our candidates, our staff in the polls... They occupied polling booths, built roadblocks... and ordered people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades, until it lost its presidency in 2000.
But they are striving for a return, and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have narrowly beaten Claderon, who led the polls before Election Day.
Calderon, a candidate for her brother ’ s conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD), the current governor, came in third, a major defeat for the divided and hapless left leadership in the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to accept the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies ties to drug traffickers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the homeland of President Calderon and he has chosen Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
Violence continues.
A PAN ’ s mayor was killed a week before the election during an election rally for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates left the local election for fear.
For the PRI, victory strengthens the party, no matter how distasteful the elections in Michoacan may seem.
The man who is likely to represent the PRI in the presidential race is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington, saying, "I think this victory will allow us to look boldly into the next year."
ADB Urges Asia to Help Save the Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is calling on India and China to help rescue the eurozone from its severe debt crisis in order to avoid a long-term downward trend that will slow down the growth of Asia ’ s economy.
Rajat Nag, Manila based Executive Director of the ADB, said that the two fastest growing economies in the world must do "everything in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the monetary bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned against the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China), which "look dispassionately" at the difficulties in Europe, and said that the financial support of European leaders and resources from Asia will help prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We are all in the same boat."
"So anyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is helpful," he told the Financial Times in an interview on the margins of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it is not immune."
"So if China and India can help, then by any means."
Europe ’ s monetary union has been plunged into a severe debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's interest costs have risen dangerously, and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The emergence of a severe debt crisis in Europe has fueled fears that the global economy could plunge into recession, and has led to calls for the leading emerging economies to join forces to support the eurozone.
Mr Nag predicted that any assistance to Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but said that mutual arrangements - such as the purchase of bonds from the EU's bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - would provide greater bargaining power to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, India ’ s Trade Minister, said that “India will do everything in its power ” to help the eurozone, as its own economy now suffers from falling exports and the drying up of foreign capital flows.
"Nobody wants the Eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We are facing great challenges and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"It is not an option, it is an assignment, because where else can we find work for our millions of young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies like India have no reason to help rich Europeans when they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe to India ’ s 1.2 billion people, more than 800 million of whom live on $2 a day or less.
"At some point they will find out that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 and spend their holidays on the beach," he said.
Lee Howell, the World Economic Forum ’ s executive director, similarly asked why India ’ s reserves should be used to keep Greece ’ s numerous and well-paid public-sector employees, with jobs in poorly managed, loss-making facilities such as the railroad.
Mr Nag said that the crises in the euro area will have 'significant knock-on effects' on the whole of Asia.
The forecast of the ADB with an economic growth of 7.5 percent in Asia for the year 2011 / now threatens "the risk of grading" due to the impending danger from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets must prepare “contingency plans ” to protect themselves from a downward trend and a significant capital drift of their rhetoric.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon about possible cuts in defence
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta fired at Congress on Monday, warning that automatic budget cuts would unnoticed weaken national security, triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon ’ s halls to the theaters of war in Afghanistan and civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon is already considering cuts of $450 trillion over the next decade, but fears that further cuts of $600 trillion or more will be necessary if Congress cannot reach a deal on spending.
“The effects of these cuts would be devastating for the department, ” wrote Panetta in a letter to Republican senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called seizure, would result in 23% general cuts and a halt to many new projects.
"Such a large reduction, carried out in such a careless manner, would render most of our shipbuilding and construction projects unfeasible - you cannot buy three-quarters of a ship or a building - and would seriously damage other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to involuntarily part with a large part of our civilian personnel and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would almost certainly have to leave civilians behind to reach the target."
"These changes would destroy the beliefs of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our alertness."
The cuts were ultimately to hit the combat forces, "said Panetta.
"While the wartime contingents in the fight against terrorism are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious encroachment on the basic budget would adversely affect the war effort," warned Panetta.
"Recruitment has been cut, which would lead to delays in recruitment and the recruitment oversight that supports the war."
"The salaries of the personnel would be reduced, which would lead to late payments to war time dealers and the legal as well as political support would be disturbed."
The two senators replied to Panetta 10 days ago asking for further details on the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of a Department of Defense seizure would usher in a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power."
“We are vehemently opposed to this draconian action, ” said the senators in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta ’ s letter.
"This is a result with which we cannot live, and it is certainly not one that should be imposed on us."
"Seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and its intervention should not be allowed."
Whether Panetta ’ s letter and the senators ’ new warnings will increase the pressure on a budget compromise or increase demands to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has become increasingly outspoken about the possible cuts, despite having many years of budget experience in Congress and the White House before coming to the top of the Pentagon, and knowing that he faces tough decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Defense Minister painted a grim picture of what may lie ahead - a military with a shell, but without a core.
"It is a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It is an air force squadron without sufficiently trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers capable of fulfilling the mission," said Panetta in his opening speech at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that lacks morality and alertness and is incapable of taking on potential adversaries."
"She really makes you get angry."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta added new details on how reductions “create significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflict and disaster, serious limitations on our global ability to intervene and intervene, leading to an unacceptable risk in future war operations. ”
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could fall victim to deletion, including those that have already been tested and are in the early planning stage.
This list also includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground combat aircraft that Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee.
Stopping the F35 ’ s further development and testing would save up to $80 trillion over the next 10 years, but proponents say it is an important next step toward rearmament, so that potential dangers from China and other adversaries can be averted.
How to Unmask a Lie
A look at the current headlines shows how worrying and widespread deception and lies are in everyday life.
The Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain, is busy coping with allegations of sexual harassment by several women, and both sides accuse each other of lying.
Penn State management is accused of perjury for allegedly withholding reports that a retired football coach has sexually abused boys.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French President Nicolas Sarkozy told US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
New York Congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made a fool of himself by circulating denials that were quickly refuted by incontrovertible evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of violations of campaign funding, which is related to the cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it forgets the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered when he lied during his second term in the Oval Office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories of cheating in school and at college are widespread.
There have been incidents in which teachers have given their students the answers to the exam so that they are good at their own performance checks.
Mentors, who should teach the opposite, send a message that lying and cheating are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
Studies show that we lie between 10 and 200 times a day.
But many of these lies are considered white lies.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Recognizing and "uncovering lies" is one that is important for everyone to learn, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from a parlor game, such as charades, in which the goal is to shout "Have you!", the unmasking of deception is a serious area of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities conducting wide-ranging research projects, particularly in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most of the old myths about lying have been unmasked.
Lies look you in the eyes.
They do not always stutter, stammer, blush and fidget.
This does not mean, however, that these liars are difficult to uncover and expose.
An experienced liar can penetrate the truth by learning about the structure of the claim, the fine facial expressions, the question and timing.
I have spent several years studying the scientific results of the vast and ever-growing area of uncovering, and it is clear that uncovering a deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and helps us to navigate in our complex world, especially when hiring or questioning people or negotiating or administering is one of your professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at judging other people, arousing their interest and controlling their own emotions, and they intuitively sense how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research, we know that extrovert people are more likely than introvert people to lie, that men are more likely to come up with "self-centered" lies than women, whose lies are more "oriented to others" - usually to protect the feelings of others - that married people are less likely to lie to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are mostly "bolder lies").
We also know that when a person is exposed as an evildoer, others feel less guilty for lying to that person.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of that person.
This is called "baselining", the starting position.
It provides a reference point for the later evaluation of changes.
Observe the attitude, the laughter, the voice quality of your subject.
They should know better when someone normally trips his foot all the time, so they don ’ t accuse him wrongly if he trips his foot during a meeting.
Then watch out for accumulations of conspicuous verbal and non-verbal behaviour.
Consider these accumulations as alarm bells that ring, not as evidence of an uncovering.
People who deceive may freeze when they try to remember their story. Perhaps, their feet point toward the door or they lean toward the exit, changing their position in a significant way, or showing a "relaxation after the recruitment interview," this deep, relaxing exhalation and the change in posture when all the hard questions are over.
Questioners often erroneously signal that a job interview is over, only to look for this relaxation after the job interview.
Also pay attention to the language of your subject.
The slip of Scott Peterson is famous when he used the past tense, when he claimed that his dead wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Deceiving persons can also use a distancing language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if one repeats a tricky question on the whole.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when they answer a tricky question: "Well... to tell you the truth... as far as I know... to the best of my knowledge and conscience."
This makes the answer more perceptive than objective, often causing alarm bells to ring.
There is no magic cure for uncovering lies, but you can learn abilities that allow you to uncover them.
Thanks to these skills, everyone is less likely to fall victim to fraud, both in their private and professional lives.
Controversial Oil Pipeline Plan to be Revised after Exposure to Delayed US Approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, which would upset unions while reassuring environmentalists, the pipe-building company is seeking to redesign the project so that it can return to normal.
TransCanada said Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be diverted from the ecologically sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference held in the Nebraska Parliament building.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said the company remains confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, albeit with a different track record.
This followed an announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week that a federal approval decision for the project would be postponed until a review of the new possible path to avoid the Sandhills area in Nebraska and the Ogallala Aquifer, a major underwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental assessment ordered by the State Department may postpone a decision until 2013, after next year ’ s elections, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama said in a written statement last week that the decision was a task for the State Department and pledged his support.
The 1700 miles of pipeline would connect Canada with the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil a day from Alberta province to refineries in Texas.
To this end, the pipeline would have to pass through six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labor markets love them, because they estimate that the pipeline will create 20,000 jobs.
But Nebraska ’ s legislators, who oppose the plan, are weighing up the laws to force a move away from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala Aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current environmental impact study by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that the project would have little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy industry says that the Ministry ’ s main auditor has requested a separate probe for the verification process, which focuses on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who served as Hillary Clinton ’ s adviser in 2008, is in conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company commissioned to carry out the initial study was an inappropriate choice, as it is linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle indicted for allegedly forcing an infant to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that the disco in the lobby of their Manhattan building, Patti LaBelle, has had a fit of addiction that has scared her little daughter so much that she vomited in fear.
The tirade of the "Lady Marmalade" singer made the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so afraid that she suffered from "personality changes, sleep disturbances" and "increased fear of strangers", her family told the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on 10 November last year that the stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve wanted to go on a family outing.
While Kevin Monk fetched the car, Roseanna Monk with her luggage and Genevieve on her arm went to the lobby in her building on Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she had stopped near the door and dropped her daughter off for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind me and said," Do you know what your daughter is doing? "I said," Yes, "and went to take her back in my arms," she said.
LaBelle angrily admonished the pregnant woman.
"She said in an aggressive tone:" You should not drop your daughter near the door, "said Roseanna Monk.
"I told her," I don't care what you say or think "."
She got angry and started scolding - she used the "F" word and the "A" word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and began to pour water from the bottle on me.
She said that Genevieve had become hysterical.
"I said to this woman," See what you did to my daughter, "said the child's mother.
LaBelle pounced on her mother, who was still carrying Genevieve in her arms, and had to be held back by her companion and pulled to a waiting car, said Roseanna Monk.
The baby screamed so much that it had to vomit, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family asked for an apology in writing, but received no response.
LaBelle's lawyer and representative did not respond to calls for comments.
The lawsuit is for unspecified damages, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he will not charge royalties and the family plans to donate the money they receive to the child cancer charity.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behaviour," Davis said.
"This kind of behaviour is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is shown to a kindergarten teacher carrying an 18-month-old baby in her arms."
Climatic adversity slowed down the economy
In the first year of Mario López Valdez ’ s government, Sinaloa saw a rise in unemployment and undeclared work, while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
2011 will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa. It is the first year that Mario López Valdez, who describes himself as the initiator of change and raised great hopes for economic growth, is in government. However, as a result of climatic adversities, there can be no talk of growth; on the contrary, the main economic indicators have deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February not only caused losses amounting to millions in agriculture, but also put tight limits on the growth of the state economy and caused a general decline in economic activity of 3.6 percent in the first quarter of the year. This is mainly due to the historical reduction of agricultural development by 31.16 percent, which slowed down other economic sectors.
According to a report on the effects of frost published by the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development), 582,000 hectares of agricultural land were damaged, of which 78.03 percent were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially destroyed. Vegetable, maize and chickpea cultivation were particularly affected.
The decline in economic activity until November has led to a continuous increase in unemployment in the Mexican State. Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid increase in unemployment during the first quarter of the year, with 55.053 Sinaloans without employment, or 4.53% of the working population, from January to March. Unemployment rose to 5.28% in the second quarter and to 6.19% from July to September, resulting in 74,000 unemployed in Sinaloa, which is 18,969 more than in the first quarter.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa in the year is due to several factors. The economist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the University of Autónoma (UAS), comments that the policies of public institutions indirectly explain the growing unemployment.
"What we are currently seeing is an increase in unemployment, which has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market as a result of the cuts in funding introduced by the legislation passed by Congress to combat money laundering, because for those who illegally pile up dollars, it is not easy to make them work for themselves, invest them or use them for anything else," he said.
Stopping migration
López Cervantes pointed out that there is also a demographic factor inherent in growing unemployment.
"The number of people leaving the country looking for work abroad, particularly in the United States, has decreased, partly because of the entry problems and partly because it is difficult to find work there as well," he says. "These people stay here and look for work, which increases unemployment."
Undeclared work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious if one takes into account the high proportion of undeclared work, which, according to INEGI, comprises 60.38% of the country ’ s employees who work without contributing to the social security system.
Unemployment and undeclared work are supplemented by low wages, the lowest in all of Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Security Institute) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Mexican Department of Labor and Social Welfare).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa until September was 5,352 pesos, much lower than the national average of 7,375 pesos.
Decline in FDI
In addition to the reduction in economic activity and growing unemployment, 2011 saw the biggest decline in foreign direct investment (FDI) in the last ten years. According to the Secretaría de Economía (State Economic Authority), the FDI from January to June was $630 597, a decrease of 87.74% compared to $5,143,312 in the same period last year.
The Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Government Office for Economic Development), for its part, recorded a total investment of 17,280,000 pesos in 2011, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
The Debt
In the face of the economic crisis, the state government applied to the national congress in July for a loan of 3,000,000,000 pesos to be invested in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities in order to reactivate the economy.
Reactions
For the representatives of the business community, the first year of the government made Mario López Valdés incapacitated.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (Mexican State Chamber of Manufacturing Industry), argued that in 2011 no efforts were made to harmonize the views of the different sectors, including the state government.
"Economic activity in Sinaloa has been very poor this year, hard work is needed to regain the ground lost this year, and we have to work twice in 2012. Everyone's efforts, and in particular the progress of the already well-coordinated government team, have not been sufficiently coordinated," he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo López said that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year made the economic development of the country more difficult and slowed down.
“The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the frost. One of the most important impacts is a slowing economy that is not moving enough to create an economic dynamic that could create an acceptable flow of processes, products and services, so we will close the year well below our expectations, ” he said.
Redefining vocation
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Confederation of Mexican Entrepreneurs) in Sinaloa, said the state must be encouraged to engage in more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done. We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program to redefine the economic vocation and line of the country, because it is important to activate all material and human resources of Sinaloa," he said.
There is a lot to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that will steer the government ’ s efforts in a better direction.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in several areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he explained.
He stressed that the current state power had made progress with the government.
"There are areas where it can be said that the government has acted more comprehensively," he said. "What I can say is that work has been done and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work to be done."
Arrest for 8 kg marijuana
A resident of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days' imprisonment for possessing eight kilos of marijuana.
The prosecution of the Republic announced that the drug trafficker was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against public health - here the possession of marijuana for sale.
According to the AP / SIN / CLN / 687 / 2010 / M File, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican military on June 7, 2010, while guarding the Cipriano Valdez road in front of the No. 80 sentry in the locality of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was driving in a white van, in which he kept a black bag in a box in the car and a small backpack on the passenger seat, in which the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated goods were handed over to the district judge, and the prisoner is still in prison.
Debt for construction
According to Miguel Ángel López Miranda, the social structures for migrants included in the Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 programmes run the risk of being unfinished or delayed due to a lack of funds.
The head of the Municipal Department of Social Development stated that, although the construction programs are already advanced, they are now in danger because the state government has not paid the funds due to it, which exceed 11 million pesos for the three programs.
He said that the total investment in these three programs was almost 50 million pesos, 25 percent of which went to the state. So far, only the Federación and the municipality have contributed to the construction, so a delay in the completion of the construction is expected.
"They have to contribute 12 million, and although the year is coming to an end, they haven't given us a penny, even though they should have paid us part of it in July," he said. "So as not to be too late, we have already started building and they are already well advanced, but we need the money."
He pointed out that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state did not fulfil its obligations, which is why the municipality had to take out a loan of 7 million euros at the beginning of the term, which is the amount that the central government should have raised.
"This was already the case in the previous legislature, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources, the programs continued to run, and this year we had to find the funds that the state had not provided to participate in these programs," he said.
Although the public authorities were obliged to disburse these funds, he commented that the Minister of Administration and Finance had been asked to speed up the administrative work and to disburse the outstanding part as quickly as possible.
"They have to contribute almost 12 million, and although the year is coming to an end, they have not given us a penny."
The court approved for 2015 the transition to digital television in Mexico
The changeover from analogue to digital signals has been one of the most important changes worldwide in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) rejected the constitutional complaints filed by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree, which requires the switchover from analog to digital signals to be brought forward from 2021 to 2015, owing to the lack of eight votes required to challenge the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his jurisdiction when he issued the decree with the details of the switchover to digital terrestrial television.
By that decision, the constitutional dispute initiated by the Senate was rejected on the ground that it did not obtain the qualified majority of eight votes required for the Court to rule on the issue of constitutionality or non-constitutionality. Thus, the law remains in force.
In the project for the lawsuit, drafted by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, it was proposed that the Legislative Decree be declared unconstitutional, since the Federal Commission for Telecommunications (Cofetel) is responsible for the regulation of radio and television, and therefore the Legislative Decree would be contrary to hierarchical principles and legislative reservations.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed constitutional complaints against the Decree-Law. Once the complaints were accepted, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied the Decree-Law and ceased all activities related to the establishment of digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the complaint submitted by the Chamber of Deputies without entering into the debate on the project, which was also the responsibility of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the regional government should not regulate the measures that the public administration should take with general regulations.
"I do not believe that doing so would compromise the independence of the regulator," she said. "It is the central government that is responsible for the planning of strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, for constitutional reasons, because it manages state affairs.
The replacement of analogue signals by digital is one of the most important changes that has taken place in recent years around the world, and it causes better use of the radioelectric spectrum, increased signal quality and more channels.
The postponement of the changeover, she said, was a postponement of the benefits of digitisation, which was a decision in the public interest that was not purely technical, "because it included economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, she stressed, "necessitated the action of the entire system; according to the principle of economic government by the state, they included a set of characteristics that the constitution placed in the hands of the central government."
She recalled that many countries around the world have already made the digital transition, through government, despite having highly specialized facilities.
It could not be concluded that by issuing the contested decree, the government encroached on the powers of the Congress, because the laws passed by the legislature would be respected, ” she assured.
The possibility to count the ballots in Michoacán individually is being considered
According to the data of PREP, the difference between the first and the second place in the election of the governor is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
The possibility of counting the ballots individually is a reality in the Michoacán elections this year, because according to the data provided by the Preliminaries Electoral Program (PREP), the difference between first and second place in the gubernatorial elections is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
In this regard, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just last November 9, the electoral body had adopted a series of regulations aimed at harmonizing local regulations with the electoral reforms of the states.
It is worth remembering that Michoacán had not adapted his political constitution, electoral law, or law on electoral justice to the reforms approved by Congress, so that they did not enter into force in this round. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in the Official Gazette within the stipulated deadlines, arguing or objecting to them.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) ruled on the constitutional complaint lodged by the local legislature, declaring the voice of the State Representative on constitutional reforms "invalid and unlawful," since he does not have the right to "decide or veto."
María de los Ángeles Llanderal said in an interview about the possibility of counting the votes individually that thanks to the adoption of the guidelines by the Consejo General del IEM, there is now the possibility that the local electoral authority can count the ballots partially or completely.
Thus, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more ballot packages may be partially counted The results in the minutes do not agree; the minutes of the counting and calculation of votes are not on file or are not in the possession of the chairman of the election committee or there are obvious errors or amendments in the minutes.
Furthermore, the total count of the completed ballot papers can take place if there is a difference between the presumed winner and the runner-up, which is equal to or less than one percent, provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is an explicit request from the party or coalition chairman, who is the second of the above-mentioned candidates.
The counting of votes may also take place in its entirety if it is established after the end of the ordinary calculation that the difference between the presumed winner and the runner-up is equal to or less than one percent, provided that there is an explicit request from a representative of the party whose candidate has finished second. In this case, the ballot packages that were subject to a partial counting would be excluded.
It is worth noting that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation where, according to the PREP, the difference between first and second place is almost 0.16%, although the votes of 129 out of a total of 923 election minutes have not yet been counted.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered over the Zapalinamé, the family confirms.
The remains of pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés trickled down on Saltillo, his birthplace, this Sunday evening. On Monday, the funeral show and a funeral mass took place.
According to family members, the last will of the lieutenant colonel was to disperse his ashes over the Zapalinamé, or mountains.
After an award ceremony, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila, together with the others who died in the accident, in a plane belonging to the Mexican Air Force. Those closest to the Colonel took part in the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At twelve o'clock in the afternoon, the ashes of the Lieutenant Colonel landed in the mourning hall on the Nazario Ortiz Garza boulevard, where the family members and friends went.
At 17.30 his remains were examined at the Technological Institute of Saltillo. This funeral was initiated by his former classmates of the Technical High School and his American football team, to which Felipe Bacio belonged during his preparation for the High School.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and spread his ashes over the Zapalinamé Mountains. He had always said this to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, sister of the pilot.
From her point of view, the Lieutenant Colonel had fulfilled all his dreams and she believed that he had stood in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, extraordinary as a father and as a son, a loving brother and he always stood up for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the village of Saltillo very young to join the school of the Air Force of Zapopan, Jalisco.
Some could not believe it, because they thought it would make him dizzy even on a truck. Nevertheless, he always strived to realize his dream to become a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio has him in mind as a good person. "He had hardly arrived in Saltillo, and the whole family wanted to welcome him, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even at the age of seven he went to Zapopán to graduate from his family, so he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked best: flying an airplane.
A Last Farewell
Lieutenant Colonel Felipe Bacio Cortés of the Mexican Air Force, led by Governor Jorge Torres López, was honored by the people and the government, the Mexican Army of the Sixth Military Area, the Mexican Air Force, principals and students of the Saltillo School of Technology, where he studied in 1985 and was noted for his excellence in both studies and sports.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when the helicopter he flew, in which the Secretary of State, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six other people from the same authority, crashed.
At 6: 05 p.m., the cremated remains of Bacio Cortés, a citizen of Saltillo, arrived in the square in front of the barracks to be handed over by the funeral company to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, who had already been awaited by his family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers.
The abandoned corpses were found on a plot of land at Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the find, military personnel introduced to the media eleven people who had been arrested in the same locality in connection with organised crime.
Three men were shot at different parts of their bodies and murdered by a mercy shot in an abandoned finca in the town of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event took place at the mileage of 1.5 kilometres on the road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the level of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several passers-by saw that the door of the country house surrounded by a beige brown wall stood wide open.
When they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three people about three meters away inside, which they immediately reported to the relevant authorities.
One was wearing a yellow tee shirt and dark trousers, without shoes; next to him was another, dressed in a white top.
Just under a meter away was another person ’ s body, wearing a red shirt and blue trousers.
All three were lying on their bellies.
According to the information received locally, the three people must have been murdered in another place because no cartridge cases were found.
On the wall of the country house inscriptions are to be read, which one organized criminal gang writes to another, in addition several shots were found in wall and door.
11 people arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional (State Secretariat for National Defence) presented 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a gang of criminals mainly active in the town of Cadereyta, linked to kidnappings, murder, halconeo (hunting of people) and clandestine funerals.
According to the information made public, eight people were initially arrested on 11 November in the Los Alveros settlement and a prisoner was released.
Three properties and a mobile phone were seized, and those arrested confirmed that they were members of the criminal group "Los Zetas".
On November 12, at 6: 00 a.m., military personnel found a car without license plates and two occupants on their watch circuit in the village of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta.
During the inspection of the car, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later, on 13 November, at 2 p.m., one of their accomplices was arrested in the community of La Frauda, who was trying to flee in the face of the military.
They are accused of secret burials in the towns of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
On Wednesday formation of the new Italian government
The Prime Minister designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government to face the crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
The Prime Minister designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government to face the crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
A note from the presidential palace announced that the Monti, who was appointed on Sunday, would meet on Wednesday with the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm the formation of the government.
He is expected to present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, though it is not yet clear when the new prime minister will take office.
Monti said he would present to the President the results of the talks with the political parties to form a government.
"I want to reaffirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to cope with these difficult times," the former EU Commissioner told journalists.
Monti did not explicitly confirm the formation of the government, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
"The framework is now well defined," he added.
In less than three days, Monti managed to form a government, which is much less time than usual. Meanwhile, Italy is struggling against a political and financial crisis that has driven the cost of debt to an intolerable level.
The new government, led by former EU Commissioner Monti, must adopt a tough austerity package demanded by the eurozone ’ s leaders in order to regain diminished confidence in Italy.
The pressure of haste on Monti was exacerbated by the volatility of the market, as a result of which Italian government bonds were priced at 7% for 10 years, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European bailout.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian industry association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would do everything possible to support this government."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to emerge from this emergency.
Monti's chances of success were considerably increased by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, which had to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are destined to produce good results," said Angelino Alfano, Secretary of the Center Right Party.
Support for the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential because, until now, many of its members have spoken out against the majority technocratic government that Monti is forming.
Support from Parliament
Monti ’ s new government needs strong parliamentary support to implement what are probably unpopular austerity measures.
Resisting his efforts or delaying reforms could once again lead to a devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks is also exerting pressure, pointing out that Monti's failure is a disaster.
Monti started his debates on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business associations, as well as youth and women's organisations.
The session is due to be concluded on Tuesday evening.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who has set in motion an extremely rapid change of government in response to the crisis.
After a brief sigh of relief at the end of last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would resign, the uncertainty about the new prime minister ’ s success has brought the cost of Italian government bonds back to critical limits.
Saving Italy with a national debt of €1.8 trillion would be too much for the current EU bailout.
Monti said that his government must last until the next elections, which are expected to be held in 2013, despite predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms, rather than bringing the elections forward.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that it should consist only of technicians, an indication of their concerns about the procedure imposed by financial market pressure.
Political sources indicate that mutual distrust and disagreements between the parties complicate the involvement of political figures.
Spaniards have more play opportunities than the Ticos
Of the 22 players called in from Spain, ten have over 50 international games under their belt.
On the part of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 convened has 50 games behind him.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when the 22 players from both countries are compared for the friendly game that takes place today at 3: 05 pm in the national stadium of San José.
While the World and European Champion, the number one in the monthly ranking of FIFA, can look back on a considerable number of selection games of class A, the three-colored team has only the defense player Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international games.
He reached that number last Friday with a game against Panama (0: 2) at Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players who play in the Liga de las Estrellas (Star League) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England have every year the opportunity to take part in numerous home games (League and Cup championships) as well as high-level European cups such as the Champions League.
Added to this is the experience with the Spanish fury in complicated elimination games at the Eurocup and the World Cup.
In contrast, the football players have few international matches in the Concacaf, which is at the bottom of the FIFA ranking list.
We will see how the Spanish team pulls out its last register: The goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who last Saturday against England (defeat 0 in London) with 126 foreign games a tie with the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta reached.
Casillas will play today against the three-colored team and Spain a new record of 127 foreign games.
Xavi Hernández, player of the football club Barcelona, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received recognition from UEFA last week, along with others from the Iberian team that reached the magical number 100: the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and the center forward of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The number one hundred is also approached by Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the side of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana are the left side striker Júnior Díaz with 48 games and the striker Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From then on, only five out of 30 games were played: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The one with the fewest games.
The Spanish team consists of Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the side of the national team come to less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn ’ t even approach the 20-man limit.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, Víctor Bolívar has only one in Costa Rica and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson have not made their debut yet.
The historic goalkeeper of Spain is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz scored the most goals with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included Costa Rica in its tour to celebrate its 20th anniversary
"Playing in Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament says the band is prepared to play one of their best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
For more than 20 years they were expected, but the band assures that a dream will come true for them when they play in Costa Rica.
This was assured by the bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave an exclusive interview to Viva from Brazil last week.
The band is in the South American part of their tour to celebrate their 20th anniversary and on Sunday, the 20th, they will make their only stop in Central America.
On that day, they will perform at the National Stadium from 7.30 p.m. together with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
They read an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which can be found in the online version of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans, a dream comes true when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what this means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that is also coming true for us.
This is just the second time we have played in South and Central America, and so far it has been great.
I have only been once on holiday in Costa Rica. It is such a beautiful country that we will certainly stay a few more days there.
It is exciting for us to bring our music there.
I ask you this because the fans of the band are totally devoted, they live the days before the concert intensely.
What do you tell your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry to have taken so long to get here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Doesn ’ t that put a bit of pressure on your visitors?
Some of the greatest shows we have done in the last 21 years have been in the last two weeks.
We played some huge shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we want to play there.
We love this country, we like surfing and we love the jungle. That ’ s why Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends used to go surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico they are great areas for surfing. In this way, we got to know about them through people who love surfing.
With a view to the tour you have presented huge shows with many songs.
What are your plans for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there, we set no limits.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think that ’ s partly because we have nine records and we can play over 120 songs. Everyone likes a different song, so it ’ s not easy to decide which one to play.
If we include two or three songs that we haven ’ t played for a long time into our repertoire, we can keep up our concentration better and they surprise us because they remind us of the reasons why we liked these songs. Otherwise, they might fall into oblivion.
That makes the show more interesting for us and I think that ’ s why it ’ s interesting for the audience.
With this tour you celebrate your twenty years of history.
When you look back, do you find it hard to believe in your success?
Yes, totally.
First of all, I think that none of us imagined playing in a great rock band for more than 20 years, and it seems like a dream.
We continue to count on this blessing and find it great to be able to make music together even now.
We like each other and are enthusiastic about making music.
We are lucky to be able to travel to the places in the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things could not be better.
What did it mean for you to have actively participated in the birth of the grunge?
It has always been an honor to belong to this group of big bands.
We are good friends with the people from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and abundantly unusual when a movement emerges from a group of friends.
Every now and then a band emerges from a city, but it is unusual when five or ten groups come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be a part of the Seattle-like group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on tour. We are still happy to be friends with them all and it honors us to be part of this emerging Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours has stayed together with the same musicians for such a long time.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which alone is much more time than many bands last.
First of all, I believe that we are all happy to be alive, and we also care about each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical paths have opened up, giving each individual the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music. We couldn ’ t do better.
Your relationship with fame has not always been easy. On the other hand, thanks to your success, you have always been able to do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we have grown has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to tour too often, because it is too easy to fall in love with this game with huge crowds who love your music.
As long as you think that people have come because of the music, it reminds you that you have to pay attention to the music and what it has brought to life, without being obsessed with being a famous rock star. We ’ ve never been interested in that anyway.
What memories do you have of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and in the beginning it was great.
For three years we were a band that had never released a record until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed to have taken so long. We are still good friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who built up the band with us. When I hear a song or see photos, I think about what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work, to laugh together and to talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and have therefore chosen the band for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and we liked this band best. So we are curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live. It ’ s going to be exciting.
Why do you change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter every time you play live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing that comes to his mind.
Who influenced you as a bass player?
From so many +
Among the first to come to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge alive even though it is no longer a fad?
I think we all do not feel very attached to the word grunge.
When I think about it, I think of the bands I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came up at the same time. If they are still important today, I think it ’ s great, because it ’ s worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney are now making better music than ever before.
Initially her music was darker, now it is more positive.
Why?
This is interesting, because I think there are some songs on the new album that could seem a bit frivolous, but there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe that are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive about them.
Both of them brought tears to my eyes when I heard Ed play them. They ’ re very dark songs.
I think when you get older and something traumatic has happened in your life - e.g. when you lose a family member or a friend - it influences your artistic work and your music and these two songs embody that for me.
But I am also of the opinion that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to examine the muscle loss of his legs, his family doctor informed.
72-year-old Fujimori, who is serving 25 years in prison for human rights violations during his reign (1990 - 2000), has several illnesses, including tongue cancer, which has been operated on four times and is under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, member of Congress and his personal doctor, told the television that Fujimori was being examined for three days at the Peruvian National Institute of Neoplasic Enfermedades to determine the cause of his pain and muscle loss in the lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons. Nevertheless, he did not want this because he considered him innocent.
He has been operated on four times for tongue cancer and has lost 18 kilos in weight. Additionally, the doctor listed other illnesses such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulation problems in the legs.
Fujimori has been held in the National Directorate of Specialist Operations of the Police since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the death squad of the Peruvian army, which was secretly active during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official delegation, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and composed of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will start their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderón. According to the Uruguayan president, this will be the culmination of his busy schedule with politicians, business people and a meeting with the Uruguayan collective living in Mexico.
The meeting of both presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries", announced the Presidency of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is seeking Calderón ’ s support for the incident with France when French leader Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G-20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his discourse, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that still operate as tax havens, a declaration that Uruguay rejected, prompting a request to its ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group of the most powerful emerging and industrialized countries in the world. An agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid double taxation with the South American country has been in place since January this year.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has tried to speed up the implementation of tax information exchange agreements in order to be removed from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) 'grey list' of countries that have not adopted all the international standards for tax cooperation.
On the business side, a Free Trade Agreement between Mexico and Uruguay has been in place since 2004 and has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The moustachioed installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for 25 years for the rescue of Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but until now never in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he fights for the love of the girl in stereo and technology.
The game, which will be released this month on the world ’ s store counters, has been tailored from the outset to the characteristics of the Nintende 3DS portable console, which can be used to play three-dimensionally without special glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy works without glasses," affirmed Omar Álvarez, who is in charge of the Spanish Nintendo press at the launch of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez explained that "Super Mario 3D Land" was "the first video game from Nintendo that was developed from the beginning for this console", because until now successful articles like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
The speaker of Nintendo underlined that although it is three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "affordable" video game that allows a fast, fluid game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: The first part is "light" to capture the less sophisticated users.
After that, the experts can "turn a second round" through the different game levels, which are becoming more and more difficult.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. To overcome the obstacles without becoming a victim of the "optical effects", however, must always be played three-dimensionally.
This excursion of Super Mario into the three-dimensional world also means the figure ’ s return to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game Nintendo winks at the fans of the saga and repeats the recipe for success of the latest editions: The mustache installer has to overcome platforms full of dangers in order to free the princess Peach.
However, the player comes across news about the movements, the environment, the disguises and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom guarantees delivery of Portillo to the United States
The President of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would allow the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to be held responsible in the United States for the $70 million money laundering conspiracy.
That is the end of the process on the US request for the extradition of Portillo, so that he can be tried there.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and the government, taking into account that a court had already ordered the extradition.
He stressed that he had not interfered in court decisions during his government and had granted all extradition requests he was informed of.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both of whom were extradited for drug trafficking, were extradited for murder and aggravated injury.
The procedure of Colom is a government act, which takes place, if all judicial and constitutional instances for the conviction of the former Staaat president (2000 - 2004) are exhausted.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be extradited if his legal situation in Guatemale is clarified and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted of the embezzlement of 120 million Quetzales in the Ministry of Defense during his term of office. This trial preceded the extradition, but the minister objected and reopened the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people threatened with social exclusion
The organisation was set up to prevent the marginalisation of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of life of the social welfare organisation Trinijove have led to important results: in this quarter of a century 6000 young people threatened with social exclusion have been supported to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, there are over 100 jobs created for this social group.
Yesterday, the anniversary was marked by an event in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, in which over 300 people took part.
Trinijove was founded in 1986 in the district of Trinitat Vella with the aim of helping young people with a low level of education, without work, with drug problems that were threatened by the risk of marginality.
Yesterday ’ s celebration in Sant Andreu was attended by a large number of persons in charge of the institutions that have worked with the association over the past 25 years.
The participation of political representatives of different tendencies during the election campaign demonstrated the impartiality of the work carried out by Trinijove.
In addition to the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the former Socialist Education Minister Ernest Maragall and the former Mayor and currently on the left Green Councillor Ricard Goma took part in the celebrations.
The large hall of Fabra i Coats was also visited by the current Catalan Minister for Social Affairs and the Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director General of the Social Services of La Caixa Savings Bank, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was born in very difficult times and that today's times are no less complicated, but added that the work done so far is "a good basis".
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinijove is an example that knows how to fight against difficult circumstances and gives hope to people in difficulty.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the club and the work it is doing," he explained.
Occupied house, where huge parties were held, was evicted
The owners occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building at 51 Balmes Street (Barcelona).
The twelve squatters left the building yesterday afternoon without resistance.
Everything indicates that the nightmares of the neighbours of house no. 51 on the street Balmes have come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building they had illegally occupied yesterday at noon, where they had organised huge festivals which had driven the neighbourhood to despair, and the eviction was carried out by order of the courts without police intervention.
After the eviction, the lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, access will be controlled," confirmed the property manager.
The squatters, who occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the others were inhabited - took the entire electrical system and part of the water supply, painted the walls and left behind all kinds of garbage, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
Huge parties were held on the three lower floors, lasting up to two days and driving the tenants to despair.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also suffered damage.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that her business had fallen by 80% since the squatting began.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the squatters were competing unfairly because they sold the drinks for three euros, while they cost 10 euros at the discotheque.
In addition, the owner of the leisure centre had been denounced by the neighbours for disturbing the peace, while according to her, the noise did not come from the visitors of the disco, but from the squatters, and in particular from the guests of the festivities that were organised there, and which, according to the angry neighbours, have been growing more and more in recent weeks.
The person in charge of the nightclub said that the harassment was so great that she agreed with the owner of the building not to have to pay rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (Municipal Police) also confirmed that they have received more complaints from their neighbours in recent weeks.
Last week, Alberto Fernández Díaz, the leader of the PP (Popular Party) in Barcelona City Council, called for the immediate removal of the building and for the problems of civil coexistence and the downfall of the neighbourhood to be tackled.
He explained that before the summer, only one floor of the building had been occupied, but that the squatters had penetrated all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments in recent months. In some cases, there had even been thefts.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to clamp down on the anti-social actions in the building."
Yesterday, another building in the district of Nou Barris was cleared by the Catalan police.
At 3.30 p.m., the police approached Montral Street No. 35 after receiving a phone call from a neighbor who was watching four people enter the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
Apart from the arguments about fees, the architects agree to the invitation to tender.
The urban call for tenders for the 16 gates reopens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the disappearance of the Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its libellous pamphlet on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
It was even compared in figures with New York ’ s Central Park.
With the sinking of the CMB in 1987, the park became in the eyes of many again the upper limit of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that does not spread in a north-south direction, but upwards (mountains) and downwards (sea).
The classification of Collserola as a natural park plays with this idea.
The model was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild boars in the role of the yogi bear.
This was the case when, in September, the city issued a huge invitation to tender, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access gates to Collserola.
There is no doubt that a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Either that is the case, or someone intends to set gates on the countryside.
The question arises: Collserola, Park or Mountain?
The call for proposals is the talk of all Barcelona architects, not only from an organisational point of view, but also with a view to reflecting on the city.
It is almost a recurrent theme to which two members of this old-established caste, who meet in the elevator, can fall back.
And it is precisely this fact that provides the material for one of the rare similarities between what three Barcelona architects think and some university professors who applied for the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Roldán, after the attack on the coast, "it is necessary" to speak about the "front on the mountains", as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, about the green apples, has not been carried out.
"One should start from the principle that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is easily accessible.
Collserola is more complex, "says the architect, for whom the title" Gates of Collserola "contains a" lexical trap ": one should not imagine it" as access to a park, but as a delimitation of areas in which one must act. "
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, regards the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" that involves "some dangers".
Dangers arising from the "uncertainty that shaping a public space entails today" after the experiences of the 1980s, which had their "swan song" in the forum area.
The first fear is to limit oneself to what may be built on.
"Confining something always means determining the next step", i.e. exceeding it.
"We have to think about new urban planning tools, because the current ones [referring to the Plan General Metropolitano (PGM)] can lead to a real catastrophe."
Modol, who adheres more closely to the question, simply says that the side of Collserola that goes towards Vallesana "can be understood as a park that does not go towards Barcelona", for purely topographical reasons.
Modol points out that there is already a study by the Patronage of Collserola, which "should not fall on deaf ears", although he is grateful to the municipality for giving his committee the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment".
Furthermore, he notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the leaflet that enables architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "doubts" as to whether this technical profile should guide the multidisciplinary teams that have been created ("just the right thing," he says). "We architects should only be a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of this article is complex, because there is no global view of Collserola in the tender conditions: "There were 16 competitions in cross-section," he says, "on the mountain axis of the sea. But there is no longitudinal perspective that considers the area in its entirety."
At least in his case, this has led to him taking part in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate next to it.
In his opinion, the city should absolutely guarantee that the strip directly above the Ronda de Dalt is equipped in its entire length in such a way that a smooth transition between the city and green areas is created.
Casino awards Jonás Larrazábal who comes free
After 72 days of silence, the commissioner of the Casino Red freed the brother of the mayor of Monterrey from the trial against him for alleged extortion.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after being forgiven by the commissioner of Casino Red in the second criminal court of the district, which is conducting the case against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for extortion.
After the assassination attempt on the Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos showing Manuel Jonás, who presumably forces him to pay a sum of money in order for the city administration to authorize the secret operation of the betting house.
Following the lawsuit, the prosecution opened criminal proceedings against the brother of the Panista mayor, who was detained for 30 days on 2 September.
After four hours with the official of the Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was brought to the Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
He stayed in this place 49 days after a second arrest warrant was issued, after the official of the Ministerio Público had rejected the crimes of bribery and organized crime.
On 19 October he was transferred to the detention centre in Cadereyta because he allegedly bribed the owners of Casino Red with one and a half million pesos. However, he only stayed for a few hours on the middle security wing because of death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the trial as an inmate of the municipal prison of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, the Secretary of the District ’ s Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, issued an arrest warrant stating that, after nearly two months of investigation, there was sufficient evidence to convict Jonás of the payment of 1.5 million pesos to the betting house ’ s representatives in order to open the betting house in return.
This Monday, the commissioner of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, asked Judge José Luis Pecina, the mayor's brother, to waive his sentence and he will be released in the next few hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministerio Público assigned to the court, García Gómez, asked whether he had repaired the damage and which of the owners of the betting house had pronounced his pardon. However, the lawyer withheld the name.
In accordance with Case 197 / 2011, Jonás Larrazábal is acquitted of all charges, and no objections can be lodged against the case and no damages are claimed.
After the hearing of the commissioner of the betting house at about 15.50 o'clock Larrazabal Bretón was set immediately on release.
The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, went to the municipal prison of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonás that he had been acquitted and that his case would be closed.
He also informed him of the judicial order for his immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane crash that claimed the lives of Secretary of Government Francisco Blake and seven others.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communications and Transport in Mexico) informed that the results of the investigation into the accident, in which the Secretary of the Government Francisco Blake Mora and seven other persons were killed, indicate that the helicopter, with all its intact structure, crashed directly against the ground without the pilot being able to make an emergency landing.
At a press conference Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before take-off that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller blades were in contact with trees at a height of 25 metres, with the helicopter losing its fuselage, seems to indicate that the helicopter had had several ground contacts."
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 passengers, which is why it fulfilled all the conditions for transporting personnel.
In addition, he said that no helicopter parts were found during the investigations in the area where the machine had run down.
"During the search, no aircraft parts were found in other places, the impact affected the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 passengers, which is why it fulfilled all requirements for passenger transport.
The area has an inclination of 7 to 30 degrees.
The priority at the moment is to get the results of the investigation as soon as possible, but it could take several months, perhaps even a year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, General Director of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for Aircraft and Auxiliary Services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter of the Estado Mayor Presidencial had flown at cruising speed at the impact and that the plane had fallen on a soft slope.
"This information reinforces the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of impact."
At a press conference, SCT head Pérez Jácome enumerated six relevant points that should be taken into account in the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with the flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of visual flight. This means that the crew must have had sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded suitable weather conditions at take-off. During the onward flight to the border area between Mexico City and Mexico City, some low-hanging clouds appeared.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that the team had chosen a lower area with better visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley due to the clouds.
Impact site:
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter coincide. Possibly there was neither a loss of control over the airplane nor a deviation from the flight route before the impact.
Dispersion of the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available so far indicates that the helicopter had crashed from the straight and lateral directions.
The pattern of the scattered aircraft remains suggests that the helicopter with its intact structure had crashed onto the ground.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The remains of the aircraft at the scene of the accident indicate neither fire nor explosion.
The latest results indicate several soil contacts.
During the on-site investigations, aircraft parts were found at an altitude of 9,200 feet above sea level, and the terrain is steep with a slope of between seven and thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter probably broke.
Some information indicates that the helicopter may have had several ground contacts.
After a meticulous search in an area that went beyond the restricted area at the scene of the accident, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, reinforcing the assumption that the intact aircraft structure had crashed against the ground.
MSS Announces a Research Protocol to Find the Obesity Gene
She leads a research project on finding the gene for childhood and adolescent obesity, which is supported by specialists from the IPN.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Insurance Institute of Mexico) announced that it is conducting a research project on the discovery of the gene for obesity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of childhood and adolescent obesity", with the aim of finding the genetic markers associated with obesity.
Miguel Cruz López, head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Department of Medical Research, Biochemistry Focus) at the Clinic Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, explained that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been formed.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) of the Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study, which will take place at the IMSS sports fields in the valley of Mexico, where tests with children and adolescents will be carried out every Saturday from 8: 00 am.
He stressed that the investigation began at the Cuauhtémoc sports field (in the western part of the state of Mexico) and has continued since October 8 at the Nezahualcóyolt sports field (in the eastern part of the state of Mexico).
When the target of 500 to 600 investigators is reached, the study will be continued at the Independencia sports field (south of the capital district) and completed at the Morelos sports field (north of the capital district).
He said the aim of the study was to learn about the factors and role of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in Mexican children and adolescents for the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of World Diabetes Day, he stated that it is intended that three thousand children and adolescents aged between six and 14 years should complete nutrition-related questionnaires with the consent and under the supervision of their parents.
They are also asked questions about their physical activity and family history of disease in order to control risk factors that could lead to diabetes or kidney failure.
He went on to say that on these Saturdays the examiners would be measured (weight, height, waist circumference), their blood pressure would be controlled and blood values such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors would be determined (attempts to identify genes related to childhood obesity).
Cruz López stressed that this study was carried out in response to health workers' concerns about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"The health surveys carried out in 1999 and 2006 showed that in just under six years the proportion of obese boys had increased by 77 percent and that of girls with obesity by 47 percent. Obesity had also increased dramatically," stressed the IMSS specialist.
He stated that the search for genetic markers is justified because the genetic history of Mexico's population is different from that of other peoples.
He stated that an average of 65 percent of Mexicans are of American descent, 30 percent are of European descent, and 5 percent are of African descent, which is reflected in genes associated with diabetes and obesity.
More generally, he explained that the genetics of obesity are expressed in the inability to burn the excess energy (calories) that we consume, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher said that the direct benefit for the study participants would be a comprehensive examination of the children to determine whether they were overweight or obese.
It would even examine the occurrence of dark skin folds in the neck and on the inner arm (acanthosis), which indicate the probability of metabolic disorders and diabetes in the preliminary stage.
All information would be treated confidentially and communicated to the parents in writing by the doctors. Doctors would explain to the parents all measurement results and suggest lifestyle changes that are appropriate for the prevention of illnesses.
Cruz López explained that there are three fundamental factors responsible for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of exercise, that is, lack of exercise in everyday life, spending most of the day watching TV and using transport instead of walking short distances.
The high calorie intake, i.e. an increased consumption of sugared beverages and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) together with a high fat and protein intake, as well as the genetics to be analysed in this research project.
Asphalt from the UNAM prevents potholes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the Mexican University UNAM develops polymer-modified asphalt to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If the signs from the road surface were to be observed, it would not be necessary to repair almost 200,000 potholes if the rainy season breaks out in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (metropolitan area of the valley of Mexico), said Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at UNAM, and assured that if the laying out and maintenance of the asphalt surface were done appropriately, the number of potholes would be significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his lecture "Potholes from a Technical Perspective", held on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible is developing asphalt modified with polymers in order to produce a mixture similar to asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
According to Herrera Nájera, this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climates, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behaviour of the road surface and thus avoid potholes.
He explained that asphalt - the heaviest part of petroleum - is a hydrocarbon compound, one part of which has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalts - and the other part a low - the so-called malthenes. Together, they give the road surface its characteristic viscous elastic behaviour.
The elastic behaviour of the asphalt means that it behaves like a liquid at high temperatures of almost 180 ° C, at 120 ° C it is very viscous and at 50 ° C almost solid, while at very low temperatures it becomes brittle.
"This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes in one day depending on weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," the chemical engineer explained.
The FQ researcher noted that most of the streets of Mexico City have a flexible surface composed of six layers of material, the last three of which contain asphalt.
Between the top layers there was a wear layer of asphalt consisting of small stones bathed in asphalt and then solidified.
Every single stone of this wear layer was bathed in asphalt.
If the vehicles move on it and forces are generated, this layer enables a good distribution of forces in the road surface.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would be distributed even better," said the chemical engineer.
"Over the wear layer," he said, "a final layer is laid out, the so-called base layer, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. sand that has also been bathed in asphalt.
Since this layer is in contact with the vehicle tyres, it requires a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and it must produce friction.
This road surface receives and distributes most of the forces, so the base layer also needs an adequate thickness and the material of which it is made must be maintained.
The weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to consider, especially the water, "he said," because it significantly affects the behaviour of the wear layer.
When the terrain becomes wet, water penetrates the layer and re-emerges only with difficulty, causing softening of all layers of the road surface and consequently the occurrence of potholes.
When a pothole occurs, "he said," the top layer is removed first, and the wear layer is only damaged afterwards. However, the damage is not immediate, it is a process that should be maintained by appropriate maintenance programs at the first signs. "
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) explained that the vehicle load is another important cause for the occurrence of potholes. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of the road surface must always be proportional to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that this regulation is adhered to in order to avoid frequent potholes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there was still a lot of research to be done, for example on asphalt emulsions, which were already on the market in other countries, and with which the potholes could be repaired easily and without applying high temperatures.
What was missing for the candidate del Valle to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that influenced the fact that Melina Ramírez Serna did not receive the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle receives his 14th mistitle.
Once again Valle del Cauca was left empty-handed when Miss Colombia was awarded the crown.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to content herself with standing on the winner ’ s podium, displaying a silver crown and the ribbon that identifies her as the new Miss Colombia.
With the result obtained that night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar, the Departamento already has 14 mistitles and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who had almost held the crown in their hands. Among the misses proclaimed are: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question that many are asking themselves today is: what was missing?
The result is the decline of a great favourite, who showed at every screening that she had everything at her disposal to be the new Miss Colombia. It was not for nothing that she had been elected Queen of the Police and Mejor Rostro Jolie by Vogue, titles that had also been awarded to the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, who took home the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered decisive for the jury ’ s decision to appoint her First Miss is that she was not convinced by the answer to the question “Which book has influenced you the most and why? ” asked by Martín Murillo Gómez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
"I read a lot, I quite believe in literature, I think it's a way to civilize, in the end I believe that the book that shaped my childhood the most is' The Little Prince ', a rather profound book.
I am currently reading 'Crime and Atonement.' It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I am reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called 'Passions'.
A response that met with little reciprocity, firstly because of the concept of 'civilising' and secondly because it had not specifically explained how each book it mentioned had influenced it.
But at the end of the ceremony, Melina declared that she felt calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, what has to happen happens.
And for all people: please read a little 'The Little Prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the darling of El Valle is burned out.
A journalist from Bogota intimated that the fact that she was the favourite, who received all the applause and who had received all the prizes in advance (Gastronomy Competition Easter, audience vote on the best hand-made costume and Reina Madre) had "made the other candidates jealous, which stressed the Queen, who could not therefore shine on stage."
This was evident in her first performance in a swimsuit on the beach of the Hilton Hotel and in her two lifts at the coronation ceremony.
Although she performed with both of them, she lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico displayed.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como en casa" at the channel RCN, said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss "shows that the candidate who won the most prizes during the competition does not become Queen after all."
In addition, Valle avoided the press at the end - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the Jurie of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
There will be a reason why, two days before the international jury was assembled, Lucy Doughty stated that she was looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. You have to look beyond the physical and concentrate on the social sensation, on the fact that she had already participated in projects before participating in the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects of derriere and fibrosis, which were noted in the stomach area. However, this is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good eating habits and responsible physical work.
The coach of the queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better ones, "but her problem with fibrosis in the abdomen, which frankly was hardly noticeable to me, pushed her score on the last day."
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos believes that the mistake of the woman from Valle del Cauca was the surgical procedure she underwent.
"The operations are ok, but Valle didn't know how to get them done right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this is where she had to pay. "
Because of this award, which is awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Contest, a cruel prediction was made after the appearance in the swimsuit, which was to come true at night. It was whispered that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize, not to let her enjoy the crown.
Whether it is true or not, the fact is that Melina is starting her reign today, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent the Colombian National Beauty Contest at one of the international competitions.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who escaped the crown despite her overwhelming performance for Cartagena.
Such was the work of the doctor who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A Lophoscopist from Cali went down in history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials plays a key role.
On November 4, a Lophoscopist of the Public Prosecutor ’ s Office (CTI) arrived from Cali as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia): "Alfonso Cano" by comparing the fingerprints.
Of the seven Lophoscopists in the department of the CTI, this week Eliazar González had on-call duty, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been involved in criminal investigations for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the communities of Chocó, where he often had to spend five days in the jungle to reach the place where the bodies he was supposed to identify were located.
In 2000, he moved to Valle and after completing the necessary courses, he specialised in the examination of the skin exposed to friction, i.e. the palms of the hands and feet.
During the week of action against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was told to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something great awaited him.
Friday night he flew in a helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he should identify two corpses and that there was a suspicion that one was the one of the man who had led the oldest guerrilla in the world. Therefore, he should take the ten-finger print of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he reached the place where the corpse was with the person being examined, he could not identify him because of his physical appearance, which did not resemble the pictures he had seen in the mass media.
He had no beard, was dressed like a local farmer, wore no glasses, and was much thinner.
But fingerprints do not lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a planting trowel, and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse to those on the impression sheet.
He had seen correctly: It was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, this man from Puerto Tejada was in charge of informing the Secretary of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was indeed the head of the FARC.
Auf Spurensuche
For a dactyloscope of Sijín in Cali, the tribute given by the president Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar González at a press conference on the fight against "Cano" was very important.
Many people do not know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science without error rate, which can be a key factor in resolving a crime.
Lophoscopists not only identify corpses, they also support investigations into murder and robbery and confirm the identity of the persons arrested.
When they are arrested, many criminals present false identity documents or they have none.
We take their fingerprints and search for them in the database.
The researcher told us that in case of theft he had to tear a piece of wall out of a house, because the thief had supported himself exactly at this point with his hand, when he pulled out a safe filled with jewelry and money.
"Walls are difficult because their surfaces are not suitable for fingerprinting, but in this case we could take the impression of the whole hand and identify the offender who participated in several thefts," he recalled.
The fingerprints can also be used to exonerate or burden murder suspects.
Recently a dead man was found surrounded by brandy bottles.
In the investigation, it was suspected that a family member might be suspect, and indeed a fingerprint on the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that he is the murderer, he is associated with the place where the crime was committed.
A dactyloscopist from the CTI explained that "the fingerprints are taken from the object with chemical or physical reagents."
When they appear, a trowel or ribbon is used to carry them.
Afterwards the prints are sent to the Asif, that is the criminal database, or to the civil registry office.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without identification documents," explained the expert from the CTI.
He said that not everything was the way it was portrayed in the TV ’ s SCI series.
Just as not everything that glitters is gold, not everything you touch is a fingerprint.
But nevertheless it can be used, if one accomplishes an appropriate comparison.
The "Indignant" Challenge the Authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators crowded into tents on Zuccotti ’ s Square.
A large part complied with the eviction order and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities this Tuesday as they again tried to enter Manhattan Square with a court order after being evicted at dawn and trying to occupy another spot on the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators crowded in front of Zuccotti, where they tried to gain access with a court order allowing the "indignant" to camp again in this spot. Meanwhile, another part of the movement complied with the eviction order and occupied a park further north in the city, where there were nine arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the square, we will gather in another place and continue the battle by legal means for the return to Zuccotti, with sit in and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the spokesmen of the movement "Ocupy Wall Street".
Bray explained that the response of the "indignant" to the evacuation of their tent camp, ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the violent evacuation of the site and allowing the demonstrators to camp.
In addition, the "Indignants" occupied a new park located at the intersection of centrally located Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to Holland's Tunnel connecting New York and New Jersey, and owned by Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the place for at least an hour. However, after that the police arrived and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray cannot give any exact figures. He assured the news agency Efe that he also saw several journalists among them with handcuffs.
The organization assures that hundreds of people have gathered at this place, where a delegation of religious leaders arrived as a sign of their support for the members of the movement and for mediation with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square (a privately owned site) remains closed in anticipation of a court hearing scheduled for this Tuesday, during which the legality of the eviction at dawn will be analyzed.
Some of the demonstrators driven from the square carried and distributed photocopies of this court order, and even gave them to some police officers who guarded the square, resulting in "some minor clashes," according to Bray, who reported that some police officers had beaten demonstrators.
The court order forbids the authorities from evicting members of Occupy Wall Street, as well as the application of "laws passed after the occupation and prohibiting the demonstrators from returning to the park with their tents and other items they had previously used."
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that this court order had cancelled the reopening of the square to the public and the demonstrators, pointing out that the city laws did not allow them to re-arrange themselves with tents and sleeping bags at the site.
The mayor personally defended the eviction of Zuccotti ’ s Square at dawn, in which nearly 200 people were arrested, and which was decided because the demonstrators “violated the law. ”
Bloomberg said it had ordered the evacuation of the square because it had "turned into a place where people did not come to demonstrate, but to break the law and, in some cases, to harm others," because "some shops have received threats," and residents fear "for their quality of life."
"The eviction at dawn was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in protecting the financial interests and not the interests of North American workers," added the movement spokesman, who accused the mayor of "not respecting press freedom."
The leaders of "Occupy Wall Street" informed that they were considering organizing "big actions" for Thursday, together with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests have been going on since September 17.
Pamela Anderson is in the TV Christmas show The Virgin Mary
Along with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will appear on the December 1 TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas"
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", lifeguard in "Baywatch", rabbit in "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Canadian TV Christmas show.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the "crooner" (ballad singer) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will appear on the December 1st program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and breathe life into a very special Virgin Mary.
Today, CTV broadcast images of the television program in which Anderson - who is also responsible for distributing self-made porn on the Internet, in which she appears together with her former husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee - appears as the Virgin Mary with a doll in her lap that is supposed to represent Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently hosted Charlie Sheen's show "My Violent Torpedo of Truth", appears as the Child Jesus.
CTV ’ s Christmas program focuses not only on Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentinean model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is not far from this controversy.
Bublé recently described North American Kim Kardashian as a "whore" at one of his concerts in New York.
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP growing by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ending the freefall spiral from early March
Since last March, Japan ’ s economy has been paralyzed, still recovering from the devastating earthquake that turned into a nuclear crisis and the worst disaster that Japan had experienced since World War II.
The government's initial estimates in Tokyo put the material damage at $300,000, a blow that appears to be weakening despite the difficult global economic situation.
After three quarters of the fall, the gross domestic product data from July to September served to finally close this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% compared to the rate projected for the year.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan the financial year begins in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery can be partly explained by the sale of machines for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
Indeed, companies increased their investment by 1.1% compared to the 0.9% decline in investments recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of unstoppable increases.
Nonetheless, the real turnaround in Japan ’ s economy is not based solely on Keynesian stimulus, which uses the crisis to build infrastructure or rebuild.
Japan has been woken up in particular by the development of domestic consumption, which now accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, spurred by growing expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market after the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "refuge currencies" of investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the gloomy forecasts for the U.S., a privilege that weighs like a gravestone on the accounts of exporting companies.
With a tougher currency, products abroad will be more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of major technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, attributed their weak results from July to September to the yen ’ s listing.
While markets continue to beset peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government remains vigilant.
"We must pay attention to the continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the effects of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said Motohisa Furukawa, State Secretary for Economic Policy, yesterday.
The perspectives are really not very exhilarating.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said that most member states showed clearer signs of a slowdown in economic development in September.
The indicator, which anticipates the turning points of the global economy, revealed that the brakes would have been put on the greatest economic potential.
Because he dropped by four-tenths to loose 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The eurozone is even below that average, which stands at 100, after falling by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens raises doubts again
Papadimos says austerity measures will be adopted, but Conservatives will not sign a written agreement
As peripheral countries ’ risk premiums spiral up and uncertainty spreads, Greece continues to stray into the labyrinth that leads out of Europe ’ s great debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is more a reaction to the pressure from Brussels than a genuine conviction of the political forces is slowly being proven by facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, pointed out yesterday that there were no alternatives to the structural reforms and that the one hundred days agreed upon when he was appointed might be too short for their implementation, the leader of the conservative party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would support the new austerity measures and in no way withdraw his call for new elections on the scheduled date of 19 February.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October", said Mr Papadimos yesterday at the opening of a parliamentary debate, which will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new government.
A package of 24 programmes to boost employment, reform disciplinary rules for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samaras ’ communication does not dispel the doubts about his position: “We have committed ourselves to supporting the transitional government, but nothing else. ”
The conservative leader went a step too far with his challenge to the EU and the IMF, the body that must unlock the 8,000 million that Athens desperately needs, and made it clear that he would not endorse any commitment to fulfilling the austerity measures.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact of the Papandreu referendum poker game, reiterated yesterday that its demand for economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties did not sign "a clear written agreement as soon as possible".
The spokesman for the Ministry of Economy, Amadeu Altafaj, said that the Troika inspectors would come back to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "what is necessary for the payment of the sixth leg of 8000 million euros," although there is still no final date.
The Greek ball still has threads for a while.
Queen Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stressed Spain's "dominant" position with regard to this type of financing
Spain "has achieved a dominant position worldwide in the role of microfinance".
Queen Sofia of Spain recalled yesterday that in the last two decades Spain has become the world's second donor of this instrument of international cooperation, whose "essence" is based on the fact that it is an "instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for the whole of humanity based on trust in people".
The Queen yesterday inaugurated the fifth World Summit on Microcredit in Valladolid, convinced that there was "no doubt" that this type of business was "absolutely indispensable" in order to achieve the millennium goals set by the United Nations by 2015, and "in particular, the target of the number of people living on incomes of less than one dollar a day, that is, below the" poverty line ".
Spain 'continues to work' on the expansion of the beneficiary network 'to the furthest corners of the world and is carrying out this task responsibly', noted Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions from the summit, which runs until Thursday, 'will guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and in particular for women', as the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have achieved many successes" and "we face many challenges."
The Microcredit Summit is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform to stimulate 'two fundamental objectives'.
The Queen said that the goal is to have 175 million poor families with access to these financial services by the end of 2015, and that ten million of these households will cross the poverty line.
The concept of micro-credits in Spain and the rest of the world goes back to the "path initiated years ago" by Muhammad Yunus, which Queen Sofia considers an "act of justice and recognition".
She described the father of this financing instrument as an "admirable idealist who has dedicated himself to the fight against poverty" and whose work she has known for 15 years when the Queen went to Bangladesh to see the lending strategy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and further meetings in the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. "We have been able to observe continuous development in all of them," said the Queen, whose commitment to this project earned her the evaluation yesterday as "head of the family" in Valladolid and as "advocate of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded her speech by encouraging those present to take part in the debate and to seek solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical commandment"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical imperative" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was a mistake to bind development aid to times of economic boom, because it was a "permanent commitment".
Jiménez believed that micro-credits were a 'serious and rigorous policy for the eradication of poverty' and that the governments of the industrialised countries must now work 'more than ever' according to solidarity criteria and must not allow solidarity to fall victim to the crisis.
For Spain, micro-credits are one of the 'most important forms of development aid'.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "the success" of "marginalizing" people "who always stand in front of closed doors" to give "hope" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that "opens its doors, inspired by the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the EU President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Christian Democrats ’ congress (CDU) in Leipzig on Monday, November 14, passed without any real difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and leader of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally envisaged in the programme, but prevailed in the autumn, particularly to satisfy those activists who consider government policy towards the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow to be too lax.
The Presidency's proposal for a European Commission Presidency was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation, which lasted several minutes and was initially held by Angela Merkel and a few hours later by Wolfgang Schäuble due to her intervention decrees, left no room for doubt on the part of the three European-minded finance ministers.
The Chancellor's main idea, as well as the motion, is this: the answer to the crisis is' not less, but more Europe '.
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could be reflected in a modification of the Treaty of Lisbon with regard to the budgetary policy of the countries in the euro area, reinforcing the control of the European Union; however, this could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote "to give Europe a face".
In any case, however, this is one of the proposals adopted by the Congress, which was clearly inspired by Wolfgang Schäuble.
To be sure, there is little likelihood that the 47 will quickly agree on this revolution: Great Britain is opposed to it, and CDU leaders believe they know that Nicolas Sarkozy agrees.
However, the milestone has been set.
Likewise, the delegates overwhelmingly rejected each country ’ s proposed weighting on the ECB ’ s board according to the weighting of individual economies, which would obviously strengthen Germany ’ s position.
The Chancellor, intent on calming the climate within her party, has therefore reinforced the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she has no longer tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" or troubled European countries that would immediately criticize arrogant Germany.
To the extent that the European motion devotes a paragraph to the importance of the "German-French friendship", Angela Merkel does not call France to the fore.
At least not directly.
This reminds us that Leipzig was the centre of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
One of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does the disease fraud represent?
After the family benefits, the UMP and the government are now tackling sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November to visit a family benefit fund and deliver a speech on the theme of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state, a recurrent theme since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which stems from the desire to test the economy to the limit, but which is no less a harbinger of a right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on reporting workers' illnesses.
Firstly, with budgetary objectives: the government is aiming for the introduction of a fourth day of leave before sick leave for workers in the private sector.
In good German, this means that a sick worker would lose four days ’ pay without the specific company ’ s permission, or at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure which, according to the daily "Les Echos", threatens to provoke anger, but which would help to raise EUR 280 million.
And which would be accompanied by another rather symbolic measure: to grant the civil servants a free day off in case of illness (so far, in contrast to the three days off in the private sector, there is no waiting period).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority also rekindles the issue of fraud, this time targeting abuses linked to the absence of work.
"Controls will be much more important and, moreover, they will have to be reimbursed if this is required," warned Xavier Betrand on Sunday 13 November in front of the RTL microphone.
As in other cases, the impact of this notification seems somewhat disproportionate to the reality of fraudulent actions in the area of sick leave.
This has, in fact, been the subject of constant observation and political offensives since 2002, which have borne most fruit.
The French are no longer more ill than people elsewhere in Europe.
Let us start, however, with the national paragraphs.
According to the national health insurance company CNAM in the year 2006 more than 237 million euro daily compensations were disbursed.
According to the Economic Research and Documentation Institute of Healthcare, daily allowances amounted to 11.3 billion euros, representing 5% of health expenditure in 2008.
This figure included 46% for maternity leave and occupational accidents and 54% for sick leave, or EUR 6.2 billion.
And therefore 2.5% health expenditure.
In 2010, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group, the average number of sick days allocated to the French was 14.5 compared to 17.8 in 2009.
A mean that conceals certain differences: another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, the career planning website, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French workers surveyed said they had not taken a single sick day.
Another study, this time covered by health insurance, makes it clear that 37% of the cases reported in 2010 were of a shorter duration than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% more.
So, compared to their European neighbors, French workers are no more prone to incapacity than elsewhere.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001, the global absenteeism rate (disease or otherwise) oscillated between 10% and 11% in France versus 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK, or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud in sick leave represents a negligible proportion of undeclared work.
The level of fraud is weak.
The strengthening of the legislation since 2002 means that there are systematic checks on sick leave that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (Public Institute for Technical and Engineering Training), under 1.5 million controls, found that 13% of the 285,000 short-term medical reports, i.e. 37.050 cases, were "unjustified or too long".
In the systematically controlled cases of illness lasting more than 45 days, one counted under 1.2 million 11% at "unadjusted or unjustified" cases, i.e. 132,000.
This makes a total of 169 000 'unjustified' cases of several million workers claiming sick leave.
A paragraph which represents only a small amount compared, for example, to that of undeclared work.
According to the UMP, Dominique Tian, author of an in-depth report on this issue in July, this represents between EUR 9 billion and EUR 15 billion of lost tax revenue per year, which is more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore much more than the de-fraudation of the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adjustment plan
Greece needed a new adjustment program to capture its economy.
This was announced to Parliament on Monday 14 November by Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, adding that the one hundred days allotted to his government by the Union were not enough to complete this task.
"In order to continue the efforts to strengthen the economy, we need support from our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment programme," the Prime Minister said in his first public address at the opening of the debate on the Parliament's vote of confidence on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken on the occasion of the Euro Summit on 27 October is the "main task" of the new government, since the participation of the country within the euro zone is "at stake", he added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos has planned to reduce the country's budget deficit "by 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The Right rejects the new austerity measures
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right wing, gave his approval to the measures already approved for an attempt to escape from the debt crisis, but predicted that his party would not agree to an additional austerity measure.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting of members of his New Democracy party.
He had agreed to reduce the budget deficit and debt, as well as to fight waste, but was hostile to any policy that would impede economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, EU Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who had prevented the IMF and the EU from releasing the necessary loan of 8 billion euros without written guarantees from all parties to support the planned measures, replied to Antonio Samaras that his word was sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and accompanied suicide must be legalized, say a panel of experts
The Canadians live in denial of death, according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The panel said that governments, health-care institutions, and physicians worked together on analgesic treatment to provide the best analgesic tools, even beyond cancer cases.
The Canadian society lives in an attitude of refusal towards death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions under which they want to die, and make arrangements to that end.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts were involved in various fields of expertise, including ethics, law and medicine.
That body recommends that the government amend the penal code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia where that choice arises, in the case of patients considered capable of making such a decision.
As prelude the experts quote a recently published inquiry of the independent society EIU, which had compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the earth ball with one another.
Although Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that "medical care for the dying in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to raise the issue of death."
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to painkillers, according to experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And, despite Canadians ’ majority desire to die at home, 68.6% eventually die in hospital.
From a national perspective, the rate is highest in Quebec, with 86% of hospital deaths.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and accompanying suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that run counter to the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it will not make any changes to the penal code regarding euthanasia and accompanying suicide.
However, according to the experts who have equally inspected all the countries whose approaches legalized or decriminalized euthanasia and accompanied suicide, there is no evidence that such decriminalization would entail abuses in its application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or accompanied suicide, by incompetent or unwilling persons.
On the contrary, far more cases of such violations are to be found in countries where euthanasia and accompanying suicide are not legalised, as Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory of the report, confirmed yesterday in a teleconference.
"Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Accompanied suicide is also practiced in Canada, although here it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians advocate euthanasia
Let us remember that, according to a survey conducted in 2010 by Angus Reid, 85% of Canadians had already expressed their support for euthanasia, believing that it allowed people at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that legalising euthanasia does not transmit the message that the lives of elderly or disabled people are of less value.
With regard to persons who have already committed accompanied suicide, 41% of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
Regarding the maintenance or cessation of remedies for patients, the situation is less clear, according to the authors of the report.
They also suggest in their list of recommendations that it should be stated in the criminal law that the removal of the means for which a legally valid refusal had occurred should not be regarded as criminal.
The panel also calls for health professionals to be trained in the task of respecting end-of-life dismissal without fear of prosecution.
The panel said that governments, health-care institutions, and doctors worked together on analgesic treatment to provide the best analgesic tools, even beyond cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to the means already widely used in Canadian health care institutions for pain relief or life-ending measures, the Panel calls for consideration of these at least, since, like euthanasia, they were not used to reduce physical pain and they related to the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described the attitude of the experts signing the report as "extreme", among other things, as it imposes no limits on the practice of euthanasia among patients in the final phase.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and over the age of 18 can ask another person to help him commit suicide," said RA Deschamps, who reviewed a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr. Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to place individual responsibility above all other values involved in the social fabric of society.
But now, he says, there would be 'guidelines and commitments in a society'.
Margaret Somerville, a specialist in health law, also expressed "strong opposition" to the conclusions of the report, which she called the "pro-euthanasia" manifesto.
Margaret Somerville, herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, questions, in particular, the reporting on the absence of abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide are legalised, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to relinquish power
Damascus denounces a "conspiracy"
Syria is increasingly isolated
The partisans of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the Foreign Ministry authorities.
Diplomatic pressure on Syria ’ s Bashar al-Assad, which, however, thanks to Russia ’ s support, is resisting a “plot ” directed against the country, intensified yesterday.
Two days before the Arab League ’ s expulsion of Syria, the European Union stepped up its sanctions against Damascus, despite the fact that Turkey and Jordan, Syria ’ s neighbours, had taken a position in favour of the resignation of President Assad.
Yesterday, King Abdullah II of Jordan was the incumbent Arab prime minister who called on President Bashar al-Assad to "relinquish his authority in Syria", in which around forty civilians and members of the government have already been killed.
In an interview with the BBC, the King of Jordan, Syria ’ s neighbour, said: “If Bashar had his country ’ s interest at heart, he would resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era in Syrian political life. ”
For his part, the Turkish head of diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, had complained that the Turkish attempts at mediation directed at the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been successful.
"Those in the Middle East who are not at peace with their people and cannot satisfy them must leave," he said, alluding to Syria, the neighbouring country with which Turkey is steadily becoming rougher.
For its part, the United States has welcomed the "intensification of the consensus against Assad and the machinations of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries such as Turkey have taken on an increasingly acute tone in the face of repression in Syria," observes Mark Toner, a spokesman for the department of state.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government have died in the region of Dar'a in southern Syria, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH).
According to this NGO, two other civilians were killed in "exchanges of fire and heavy bomb attacks around Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs.
At a press conference, Syrian Foreign Trade Minister Walid al-Muallim nonetheless said that the country was "heading towards the end of the crisis."
Incidentally, he reacted strongly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its duties, which he considered a "dangerous step".
Syria "will not give in," he added, asserting that "the plots forged against Syria will fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently investigating a "civilian protection mechanism" and wants 500 members of Arab human rights organisations, the media and military observers to be sent to the country.
The French Minister of Foreign Trade, Alain Juppé, had also declared himself in favour of sending UN observers to protect civilians from repression by the regime, which was encapsulated in his "paranoia".
An extraordinary re-assembly of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan for the exit from the crisis, adopted on 2 November, and in particular the controversial anticipated withdrawal of military forces from the besieged cities and the liberation of imprisoned demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov yesterday described the Arab League ’ s decision as “incorrect ” in order to avoid supporting any sanctions against Damascus, even though China had already warned Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti calls on markets to be patient and Italy to be self-sacrificing
Mario Monti, the future Italian head of government, has demanded a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a program that demands "sacrifices" to recover the credit lost during the last few months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU Commissioner yesterday held a negotiation with the political parties ahead of today's meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his job to convene a cabinet composed relatively strictly of external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims", said Francesco Nucara, MP of one of the many smaller parliamentary groups taking part in the talks, after meeting the President-in-Office of the Council.
For his part, Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, had to wait until Friday for Mario Monti to give the Parliament a vote of confidence to ensure that the new government had sufficient support.
The agreements will culminate in the presentation by M. Monti of a deletion list, which will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to the head of state Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that yesterday's nervousness of the stock exchange and bond markets demanded their time.
In "a democracy, there are certain deadlines" to prepare a government and a government program, he stressed, noting that "it is certain that the markets will be friendly and reasonable."
His appointment by the president was initially welcomed by the markets, but the unrest had intensified again, especially after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the eurozone in September.
The incumbent prime minister should establish a staff of mainly technocrats, although he had stressed that he would also like to include "politicians".
The new government should only exist until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, president of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should receive a vote of confidence from the parliament by Friday.
Since taking up his post, M. Monti has committed himself to working urgently towards the goal of making Italy the "new protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for EU Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change, even in the light of the new government".
In particular, the EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its budgetary equalization target in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has requested new hardship measures.
Emma Marcegaglia ", head of the bosses' Italy, which will meet Monti on Tuesday, also insists on the need to stimulate the economy" because a country which has no growth can not respect the deficit indicators ".
M. Monti, who is known for his competence as well as his independence as EU Commissioner (1994, 2004), stands for an "epoch change" of Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconi"; the "professor" symbolizes the "challenge of trustworthiness" as well as "another Italy", so the editorial authors.
The greatest unknown here is the longevity of his rod.
President Napolitano would like to prevent early elections, as from now until April 2012 Italy has to pay for 200 billion euros in government bonds.
Russian scientist helps Iran ’ s nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vyacheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a nuclear detonator, an American NGO specializing in nuclear risks confirmed on Monday.
The ISIS Institute for Science and International Security bases its findings on the recent report by the International Atomic Safety Agency (AIEA), as well as other UN agency documents identifying this scientist.
The AIEA had announced last week its' serious concern 'about a' possible military dimension 'of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS ’ s in-depth study of the AIEA, Danilenko, born in 1934, had apparently been working for more than three decades since the early 1960s at a Soviet military nuclear facility in Chelyabinsk, Ural, and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he is said to have left the centre in order to set up a company in Kiev that produces "nano-diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company had led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then participated in an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002 before returning to Russia.
In its last report, the AIEA mentioned "strong indications that the Iranian development of 'a nuclear explosives system' has been supported by the work of a foreign expert who is not only highly knowledgeable in this technology, but who has also, as a member of the Agency stated, worked throughout his professional career on this technology directly on the military nuclear energy programme of his country of origin."
Anti-Islamic crimes and crimes have increased by 50%
Crimes and offenses against Muslims have increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other violent racist or sectarian crimes, according to FBI statistics released on Monday, have either declined slightly or only increased marginally over the same period.
According to these data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. by 49%, whereas there was a 13% increase in acts of violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews and a global increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
According to the FBI, the overall number of "hate crimes" increased to 6,628 cases, among them 47.3% due to racial differences and 20% due to religious differences.
"After a slowdown in 2009, it is worrying to see these crimes and offenses growing again," the human rights organization Human Rights First stressed. "The increase in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant," the organization added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First had long stressed that the violence directed against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crime, should be regarded as a serious violation of human rights law," added Paul Legendre, a person in charge of the organization.
"The American government can and should do more to combat these attacks," he added, assessing that this could be done by improving police attitudes towards "hate crimes."
The "hate crime" appears in American federal law as an heir to the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Luther King in order to punish acts of violence against race, colour, religion or descent, which now also include offences of sexual affiliation.
Twitter transforms the platform and resembles more and more Facebook
The microblogging website Twitter has on Monday introduced changes in the presentation of their platform, in particular to allow their users to monitor the activities of those who follow their entries, which makes the service once again similar to that of Facebook.
The new "Activity" tab and another "Name" tab allow you to better read live the activities of other "twitterers", the Internet users whose messages ("tweets") you follow and who follow your messages.
This allows you to find out whether they allow you to track your messages, subscribe to new posts, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter “menu offer ” had been tested“ in a small percentage of users ” prior to its general Internet dissemination on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive functioning, equipped with somewhat esotheric-looking wording (RT referenced to repeat the contribution of another person). followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable a celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google +.
In the network, users debated about this innovation with the help of certain "tweets" about the Internet.
“It ’ s useless, intrusive, and too much like Facebook, ” writes @ jemb123.
"The" Activity "feature will help me better track certain elements of my Flux", announced @ dannykronstrom.
Austria
Inscription of a "Golden Household" rule in the Constitution
The government of the large Social Democratic / Christian Democratic coalition in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to include a "Golden Budget Rule" in the constitution in order to reduce public deficits and also to avoid possible degradation by rating agencies in Austria's top credit rating (AAA).
It was the Social-Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann personally who had announced this decision of the Council of Ministers, although the Austrian public debt is at 74.6%, i.e. far above the criterion of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debt level of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria ’ s ability to pay had not declined at one stroke from AAA to AA +, we would have to pay an additional three billion euros in interest each year, ” argued Michael Spindelegger, Vice Chancellor and Christian Democratic Foreign Minister.
Austria is also accepting a demand made by the Brussels Summit of the Member States of the Eurozone on 26 October: the Heads of State and Government at the time had demanded the introduction of the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to the public balance of accounts in the Constitution or by enacting an equivalent law.
The measure taken by the Austrian government in this regard is similar to the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to include such a "rule" in the constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should decline by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and by 2017, the structural budget deficit of the state should not exceed the 0.35% of GDP threshold, while the regional states and municipalities should have balanced budgets.
The aim is to wipe out the budgetary debt on the horizon of 2020 / 21 under the 60% criterion established by the Maastricht Agreement.
Strong yen
Noda threatens new intervention in currency markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that if the yen continued to rise, Japanese authorities would intervene in currency markets again.
"If we find excessive volatility" in the Yen exchange rate ", we will intervene in the same way as we did last time", Mr. Noda declared in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen again soared close to the historic levels that forced the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
That day, Tokyo massively sold yen against dollar in order to lower the Japanese currency value, which is heading for a new record value against the dollar since 1945.
However, the yen has risen steadily, driven by purchases from investors who see the yen as a "refuge" in these uncertain times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday, and the euro fell below the symbolic level of 105 yen, close to the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008 financial crisis, in 2009, the dollar was around 120 yen, and the euro more than 160 yen.
This straw fire of the Japanese currency harms the exports of the archipelago, as it increases the cost of the "Made in Japan" products and reduces the income value drawn by Japanese companies from abroad, since they exchange them into national currency.
"Japan is fighting for its reconstruction after the earthquake and tsunami that devastated the region of Tohoku (north-east) on 11 March," stresses M. Noda, who fears that this rise in the price of the yen could kill the weak upswing in the bud.
The third global economic power has regained traction for the first time this year, with growth of 1.5% in the third quarter compared to the previous quarter, thanks to the surge in exports and consumption by households "sealed off" by the disaster.
The prime minister, however, estimates that the yen's high cost of living does not reflect "Japan's economic foundations."
For his part, Finance Minister Jun Azumi has called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which on Tuesday opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Committee, to take all possible measures to invalidate the yen.
However, Hirohide Yamaguchi, deputy governor of the institute, announced that the BOJ had already taken "appropriate measures," stating that no additional currency relaxation was to be expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting at the end of October, the central bank increased its government bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) in order to redeem the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) of cover it had spent on various purchases of financial instruments to flood the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interest rates soar, stock exchanges pull back
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis constantly undermines the European indicators.
Despite the inauguration of the new heads of government in Greece and Italy and the best growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened Länders continue to rise steadily.
The stock markets, which are still concerned about the stability of the Eurozone, are drifting even more into negative territory this Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 o'clock and dropped to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt fell by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
"Due to new tensions over bond yields in the troubled eurozone, global stock markets continue to surrender part of their recent profits.
"Investors are nervous and well aware of the risk of contagion," says Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the Reuters press agency.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which in turn is suffering from the renewed fear of market participants regarding capacity in Europe that the debt crisis will continue, closed with a downturn of 0.7%.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has turned its eyes to Europe, and trade is moving on a limited corridor of variation, as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilized, ” estimates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concern about the future of the eurozone is damaging the single currency, which will continue its bears on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level for a month and a half.
At about 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1.3570, which is 0.4% less.
According to the stockbrokers, it has declined after the CDU, the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, which met in Congress on Monday, accepted a motion that, in particular, allows countries in difficulty to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% limit.
Loan interest rates in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
This Tuesday morning the yield of the Italian bonds for 10 years reached 6.85%, that of the Spanish securities matured to 6.2%.
These interest-rate tensions in the south, but also in France, continue to feed investors ’ fears.
The future Italian head of government, Mario Monti, demanded more time from the markets to restore the situation in Italy, which was threatened with paralysis by the debt burden.
For his part, the new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos had confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken on the occasion of the 27 October Eurozone summit was "the main task" of his government.
Spain is in the visir of the markets, as the parliamentary elections take place in the country on Sunday.
The spread of the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has reached yet another historic high.
Anticipating Eurozone growth
Statistically, France ’ s economic growth, supported by household consumption, was 0.4% in the third quarter, thus slightly better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Statistical Office (INSEE) had revised the downturn in the figures for the second quarter, with a decline of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
In reality, it is the fourth quarter that worries economists most.
Germany, for its part, grew by 0.5% over the same period.
A first extrapolation of the entire eurozone is expected at 11 a.m., with the EU Commission warning against the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should prevail over dogmas
If there is an issue that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions, it is certainly energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is reasonable to take an election meeting as an opportunity to reflect on this issue and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on the planet, demographic evolution is driving a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, so that an enormous proportion of the world ’ s population does not have to forego a vital element.
At the same time, it is necessary to alleviate the scarcity of fossil resources in order to continue producing electricity without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate in order to combat climatic irregularities.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains isolated in its decision to abandon nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which is subjecting its decision to the necessity of finding a substitutable replacement source, nor in Switzerland, which only plans to build nuclear power stations of the last generation.
The UK, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name but a few, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
For its part, the United States decided after Fukushima to add another unit to its park by reopening the Three Mile Island plant, which had been shut down after the nuclear accident.
Although the German model based on renewable energy sources is sometimes presented as a model, reality contradicts the discourse.
The election in Berlin will be reflected in an increase in the price of electricity, an increase in energy dependence on Russia in particular due to the increased use of imported gas, and an increase in CO2 emissions from gas-fired and coal-fired power plants.
All of these unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months.
The Danish case gives us food for thought.
On the one hand, Denmark is the European championship leader in wind energy, from which it obtains 30% of its electricity, and on the other hand, it is one of the largest users of coal and gas, alternating with wind energy; for this reason, its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours are paying a 40% higher electricity bill than our French households.
Since the price of energy is a key competitiveness factor in the globalised economy and a source of stability for industry on national soil, French companies have an advantage because of the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore lead to a sharp increase in the price of energy, which would make noble statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power an illusion.
Surveys have shown that this is a price that the vast majority of French people are not prepared to pay, just as they have shown resistance to the principle of this energy source.
Let us remember that the energy policy of our country has made it possible to create an industry with 125 000 direct and 410 000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a host of specialised small and medium-sized enterprises to international markets and makes them creators of countless jobs.
If France were to decide to abandon nuclear power, a large proportion of these SMEs would fall victim to it, and the EUR 6 billion a year of capital goods and nuclear energy exports would shrink more and more.
What electrician would hire an EPR designed to function for sixty years if the demise of his producer is pre-programmed?
In order to solve the energetic equation one has to admit that there is just as little a miracle cure for the production of electricity as there is a work of the devil.
The low-carbon solutions for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy developed by Areva testify to the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a safety authority which carries out uncompromising and transparent controls in existing factories, such as the one in Flamanville.
Their work teams, who have made a name for themselves because of their professionalism, are just too obsessed with the idea of security.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, at Three Mile Island, has occurred under normal operating conditions, with no consequences for man or the environment.
At Chernobyl, the drama was conjured up by reactor construction and blameless human error.
At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters of unprecedented proportions, which caused the deaths of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn the same lessons from this accident as it did after the two previous ones.
As a result of this approach, as well as a cooperation between the safety authorities of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power plants, the EPR is a draft that enables it to resist such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable among the electrical engineers to build a nuclear power plant, a halt in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF, allowing them to take the lead in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is indispensable and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and party manoeuvres dominate a debate that also determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy of Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from many angles - overloading of police, judicial and administrative organs due to a policy subjected to the figures, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights", as France had called itself.
Recently, the newsreels were dominated by official harassment of foreign students, and the Minister of the Interior announced casually (see Libération of 23 May) that France "does not need talents, bricklayers or waiters from abroad."
But this policy has rarely been analyzed from an economic point of view.
There is a broad consensus on this subject between the right and the left.
On the right, the tone was taken by Jacques Chirac, who in 1976 declared that '900,000 unemployed, including over 2 million immigrant workers, should not be a problem for a country', on the left by Michel Rocard, who in 1990 had stated that 'France cannot absorb all of the world's poverty'.
The only difference is the degree of generosity
Fear of invasion of the national soil by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared by both the right and the left in 2005.
Both camps perceived immigrants as a burden on the economy and French society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity one is willing to admit to immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande confines himself to banalities which indicate that cooperative development enables us to solve our "migration problems".
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may have an impact on elections; however, it is economically costly.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron remind us in a recent book that summarizes the latest findings on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.), there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of the influx of immigrants on economic growth, wages, and jobs in immigration countries.
Restricting immigration would weaken growth and damage the labour market situation.
Fears of migrants ’ influence are based on the notion that they threaten to substitute local workers, especially the less skilled, by exerting pressure on their wages.
Experience shows, however, that immigrants are, in fact, much more complementary than domestic wage labourers, as they focus on occupations in sectors that are unexploited in terms of employment.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract domestic wage labourers, the more qualified immigrants work in dynamic sectors where training is not adapted to the labour supply.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country with a shortage of anaesthetists, this complementarity between locals and migrants also has a positive effect on wages and the domestic labor market.
Giovanni Peri has thus calculated that a 1% increase in the flood of immigrants will bring about a long-term, inclusive increase in real wages of between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas brought in by immigrants is conducive to economic growth (large proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay, and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net to social systems, in European countries on average around 1% of the total budget.
The World Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that a person immigrating to Germany at the age of 30 earns a net contribution (income minus expenditure) to the public budget of around 150,000 euros on average over his or her lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to make the missing points "with the teeth" at the beginning of his mandate.
These said teeth, which should deter the immigrants, achieved however exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, now it remains to think European democracy through
Democracy is a precious good; it is also a delicate good.
The European continent should be able to remember for itself who, after their invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, endured the entire 20th century with the tragedies of the First World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Franco's in Spain, Salazar's in Portugal and the supreme in Greece.
Some might have thought that exercising the right to vote was enough, and in the most direct way possible, to see democracy prevail over its enemies once and for all.
One knows since Napoleon "the small one" that it was a characteristic of the attitude of mind.
Universal suffrage, which is a necessary condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition for this and can just as well become an "instrument of oppression", as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot put it at the time.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, organisation, separation and control of powers, education, enlightenment, an economic and social community spirit, a jurisprudence.
The crisis in Europe in which we find ourselves is an economic crisis, but it is also, and above all, a political and democratic crisis.
The change of attitude in the Greek True and False Referendum would have been doubly instructive in this respect: on the one hand, the need for a vigorous return of politics, but on the other hand, the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, its inappropriateness.
This ambivalence should be considered obsolete.
The truth is that the frontlines of the democratic struggle have shifted today, and Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer heading in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain from pushing for the success of the national referendum, which has been organised according to necessity and in the wrong order.
A free ticket for the European autocrat or a blindfold leap into the emptiness of nationalist retreat: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want hackers, but a collective task, by full right, settled and continuous, an election and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain or Portugal - incidentally, we no longer know where to end the list - because there is only one crisis, and that is Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that is bowing to the dictates of the markets and credit rating agencies, suffering from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated at international level.
There is concern about transfers of sovereignty to Europe, but it is the whole of Europe that is gradually losing its sovereignty, and thus each of the nations associated with it.
The urgency is to restore popular sovereignty to the leadership of the European project.
After all, it is up to the whole thing whether Europeans can reduce the burden of their debt, free themselves from the markets and build a future through investment.
The exit from the crisis has as a condition decisions at European level, which cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy, without leading us to complete ruin.
After a long period of opposition to this proposal by Jacques Delors and the Socialists, everyone is now pushing European economic governance.
I agree.
But to imagine this without political integration and a stronger democracy - as the citizens envisage - would be another folly and another impasse.
We must embark on a new stage of European construction.
In order to create a republic in France, it was necessary to "create" republicans.
The revolution of interests alone could not suffice here.
This instruction remains valid.
We need to build a more integrated Europe economically.
This can only be achieved by creating a politically more democratic Europe, a truly European people's sovereignty.
We need Europeans to build Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards become common property
The world fair for chip cards opens its doors on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in an optimistic attitude.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 was supposed to end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor chips (EC-cards, SIM cards, telephone), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most important segment here is contactless technology, which enables payments on public transport or for purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
This year 460 million contactless smart cards should be sold worldwide compared to 320 million a year earlier!
Its market share should increase even further in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent more than 10% of the global chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe is gaining ground on contactless payments, having long lagged behind the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million visas are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless visa cards were distributed.
Consumer markets, however, are creating steam.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCards this year.
In order to speed up, it is now necessary for banks to equip their customers with these cards.
"Two major French financial institutions have committed themselves to systematically distributing bank cards with contactless chips to their customers in the future," announced Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile phone
However, this is only the first step towards becoming the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
A miniscule percentage of devices is currently equipped with the necessary NFC (Near Field Communication) technology to carry out these transactions.
"They have fallen behind".
"But they should at least experience a real upward trend next year."
"We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012," says Marc Bertin, Chairman of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the initiative.
The Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the start of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees will be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale also said yesterday that it was preparing to launch an offer that would allow its customers to make contactless mobile payments.
Terrorist front of course, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about relations between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-suspected relationship between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seems to be confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers had now "gained certainty" about this.
"The way in which both organisations operate and the relations between the secret services indicate clear cooperation," he said without going into any further detail.
Paris seems to make a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two French people in Niger last January has revealed interfaces.
The following day, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, kidnapped by Aqmi supporters in a restaurant in Niamey, were allegedly killed at the same time as several of their kidnappers during an operation carried out by the French special forces.
French and Nigerian investigators reportedly found several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists in the rubble on the scene.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the telephone calls leads to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: one leads to a Nigerian who has spent a long time in Maiduguri, a town in northern Nigeria that was the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is considered to be close to the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but there is no doubt that we have to wait for clearer evidence before we can speak of operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
"However, it is conceivable".
"It has been known for years that the sect receives financial and intellectual support from the outside and that it is increasingly active," says Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, the "support" has become increasingly evident, as have Boko Harem's speeches and modes of operation, which now point to the involvement of suicide bombers and the use of increasingly complex explosives that bear the same signature as those used by Aqmi.
Since then, the international community, starting with Washington, has put pressure on Abuja to address the problems caused by Boko Haram.
Indeed, the Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of Illuminists, to which no particular attention needs to be paid.
Rapid success
Boko Haram, founded in 2002 in Maiduguri near a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf - which in Haoussa means "Western education is a disgrace" - is pursuing the establishment of an Islamic Emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this penniless region, the merger is rapidly gaining ground.
It is politicizing and demanding strict adherence to Sharia law, while its affiliated activists are engaged in the struggle against the godless central government.
The activists are initially targeting churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active with their intensified attacks on the commissariats.
The reaction on the part of Abuja, however, is as usual indifferent.
The army surrounds the city, 800 people are killed.
Muhammad Yusuf, who was taken prisoner, is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect is becoming increasingly radical, leaving its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas, she confessed to an assassination attempt in Jos that claimed 80 lives, followed by another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is blamed for a suicide bombing that took place in the secure police headquarters in Abuja, the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations will be the primary international target.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is to lead from Mauritania over Nigeria up to Somalia, concerns since then all security experts.
While the Aqmi have occupied Mali and Niger, the Somalis of Al Shabaab operate in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria, Alain Juppé warned of Boko Harem and expressed his willingness "to share all the information".
The World According to Republican Presidential Candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete in simplification and ignorance about China, Iraq, and assistance to Israel.
Can a crisis-weakened America lead a complex world of simple, not to say simplistic, ideas?
Listening to Republican presidential candidates, voters may almost get that impression.
For several days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry, and their cohorts have repeatedly made their thunderous declarations and statements about foreign policy, the traditional Republican focus.
There are slogans about China, Iran and Israel, often unsubstantiated.
Mitt Romney, who was the most popular in appointing the "Grand Old Party", threatened to quote the Chinese at the WTO, accusing them of "currency manipulation" - the leading issue in an America that is highly irritated by the migration of entire industries to Asia.
Stupid if this is to imply launching a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama ’ s former ambassador to China and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of foreign policy, has almost confined himself to his emotionally flattering behavior.
He had called for a solid but constructive exchange of views with Beijing (also Obama ’ s current position).
But Huntsman is not heard, because he stagnates in the depths of opinion polls.
Reagan's image
Romney had also vowed military strikes against Iran should sanctions to halt the nuclear program fail.
"If I am elected, I will stop Iran," he said.
"If Obama is re-elected, they will get the bomb".
He also promised Israel increased military assistance and accused Obama of failing to fulfill his obligations to this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second-highest candidate, displays a shameful ignorance of the file.
Recently, he called for the Chinese military threat to be contradicted, because Beijing was "trying to develop a nuclear power" - and seemed to ignore the fact that China has had military nuclear weapons since 1964!
For his part, Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military strikes against Iran, says he is prepared to put the American army in Mexico into service against drug cartels.
The recourse to torture measures against suspected terrorists, which Obama prohibited in 2009, was also supported by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
It is far from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, a foreign-policy heavyweight.
Contrary to the current presidential contradictions, Reagan also had simple ideas and, despite everything, won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama, too, was an amateur and had to add water to his wine when it came to anti-terror.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naïve dialogue with Iran, the hasty departure of his "boys" from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which also earned him the reputation of weakness.
But this hostility is not so easy.
The population rather appreciates the positive balance of national security under Obama, which has eliminated Bin Laden.
Since Iraq, it has been wary of military interventions that lead to paralysis.
And Obama surprises more appropriately, arguing that America must be rebuilt economically to revive its leadership.
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the bottom of the Baltic Sea and connects Western Europe directly to Russia, has been put into operation.
It will provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with splendour and glory.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Russia and Germany directly below sea level, accompanied by orchestral sound and a gourmet buffet.
German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon, and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have symbolically joined forces to control the valve that transports Russian gas to the Western European network.
The new gas pipeline is intended to supply 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year to Western Europe through a first pipeline of 1,224 km in length, which connects the region of St Petersburg with Mecklenburg in Western Pomerania.
A second pipeline, which will enable a total supply of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of France's total consumption - is to be completed by the end of 2012.
And the possibility of the construction of a third line on the same route is already hinted at.
For Gazprom, the timely and precise completion of this enormous structure looks like a victory.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
In fact, the Nord Stream pipeline will enable the direct supply of gas to Germany, avoiding any route through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) by land.
That is why these two countries are losing a little of their power: it is becoming more difficult for them to exert pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, the city most heavily involved in the debate, was not afraid to compare the Northern Stream Pipeline with a "new German-Soviet pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically extremely sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply by supporting this Russian project.
This, however, at the expense of exhausting European energy, as the project has opened a gap between Western and Eastern Europeans.
In barely five years, Russia has managed to impose its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which have high gas consumption and are running out of gas.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way", confirmed François Fillon at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, pointing out to what extent the major gas contracts are also important from a political and economic point of view.
All of this explains the broad smile of the numerous Gazprom managers in Lubmin regarding the gas supply.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technology.
The underwater pipe consists of steel with concrete coating, which is to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, at a depth of about 200 meters.
Minefields dating from the Second World War had to be avoided during their construction.
"About hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," stated Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
In addition, increased measures had to be taken to protect the fauna and flora.
The pipe is a long snake made of metal, weighing as much as 242 Eiffel towers, which is uninterrupted over the entire length: neither by valves nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project managers refrained from doing so because the Swedes were not keen on seeing a Russian state-owned company establish itself permanently on the level of their coasts.
"In the event of an accident, we close the gas passage in less than a minute," Jens Müller specified.
In the event of a leak, the gas in the gas pipeline escapes into the air.
This case, however, is considered by the designers to be less likely, since the welds were estimated to be resistant to one leak per 100,000 years.
State monitoring of the gas pipeline is ensured both by an underwater robot, which is controlled for external observation purposes from a seagoing vessel, and by a device that circulates inside the gas pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigar, measures one meter in diameter, is inserted into the inside of the pipeline and moved by the gas pressure.
After three complete days of moving through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device, upon arrival, provides the most accurate information on possible deformations of the metal.
The gas pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without the slightest need for repair.
The gas circulation is simply ensured by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the entrance, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five societies have joined forces to realize this project.
However, the management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Furthermore, the German companies E. ON and BASF are affiliated (15.5% each) as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have formed a business community called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased to that company the entire capacity of its gas transport, on renewable twenty years of contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how much gas is actually transported," specified Jens Müller.
The financing of the gas transmission construction was secured to 30% by shareholders as well as to 70% by bank loans.
The total labour costs should amount to EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to EUR 240 million.
However, the minority shareholders are certain to recover their expenses, since Gazprom alone bears the liability risk.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic Sea along a sandy, pine-forested coastline near Lubmin.
The 4.5 metre high valves form the gas outlet.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been supplied with one million cubic metres of Russian gas per passing hour.
At full capacity this would be 3 million cubic metres per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Founded by an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to give writing a new style.
It has a flair of adventure, of hours spent writing by candlelight.
The notebook of Moleskine is easily recognisable, with its black, rectangular cover, its elastic band, the egg-shelled pages, as if aged over time.
The Moleskine Notebook as we know it today, however, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a distinguished design notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, the company ’ s specialist consultant at the time, is in charge of launching the new product onto the market.
The notebook was inspired by a traditional production technique called Mole Skin, which refers to a cotton varnish used for upholstery, for example.
This type of notebook was in great demand among writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has revived an old and almost forgotten object that was considered an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century," explains Maria Sebregondi, who is now responsible for brands at Modo Modo.
Success comes.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% and established themselves with sales of 12.7 million pieces.
This is far from the usual production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to make a snapshot of the buyers, as the notebook inspires business people as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of a cosmopolitan, cultured and open-minded customer.
The small Italian company, which initially employed 12 people, now employs over 100 people and has had two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in bookstores, on Internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques in city centres and knows how to assert its identity.
"We have followed the zeitgeist and its new writing needs, which exist despite the upswing of the E" mails ", explained Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural trait is accompanied by the development of the Moleskine company: recently, the brand launched an exhibition called "Detour", in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, the company also launched a leopard binding at the Locarno Film Festival.
Moleskine benefited from its success and this cultural zeitgeist and was able to diversify its products: bags, calendars, pens, computer cases... The brand features the whole range of articles.
A success that brings envy on the scene: In autumn 2006, Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today ’ s Syntegra Capital, thus opening a new chapter in the history of the Moleskine company.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain so high?
Approximately 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
The 15th Work for the Disabled Week begins today.
Despite a purposeful public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for disabled people is always twice as high as the average: 19% against 9% of the population as a whole.
Discouraging?
"No," says Éric Blanchet, Director General of the Adapt Association, which is organising the 'Working for the Disabled Week'.
"The progress made in fifteen years is considerable."
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not double, but triple."
"Nevertheless, a great deal remains to be done."
However, it must be said that many obstacles remain for disabled unemployed people before they get a job.
It is more common with older people: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them do not have a baccalaureate and only 10 000 disabled people are among the 2.3 million students with a higher level of education.
Lastly, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% of the disabled, compared with 38% on average.
In short, there are so many criteria which make it difficult to get back to work and which are "at the heart of the problem", said Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
So much for the practical brakes.
Remains the unspoken, the attitudes which, while certain, develop slowly.
A study carried out in April by the IMS Entreprendre association for the magazine La Cité stated that the managers surveyed had "a low level of knowledge regarding the disabled", which was "over-represented" by "people in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually deprived".
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go to reach the 6% employment target for disabled workers, which was laid down in a 1987 law.
These latter figures, dating from 2008, indicate a quotient of 2.6%.
“We are now close to the 3%, ” says Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the organization charged with collecting contributions from companies that violate this law.
The proof is that the number of "fee-paying" establishments has decreased, as has the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The law of 2005, which provides for increased contributions, created a strong pressure on companies," said Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also expresses a real insight, especially among the large groups of companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of establishments with between 20 and 49 employees employ disabled workers, while companies with between 100 and 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard: "What a Luck"
Even before they stood up to the "Blue Tuesday evenings" (8: 45 p.m.), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had not concealed their pleasure, which the friendly game brought them.
It would be too far-reaching to say that there was a secret agreement between them, but the picture speaks symbolically.
Sitting side by side on the podium of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard would have liked to make peace.
Five months after the temperamental gesture of his attacking player against Turkey, the Belgian coach had received nothing but praise for his person.
"I am very happy with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian".
"I would like to look forward", assures the native Liller for his part.
As for the contrast between his performance in the club and the national team, "It is a unity, that justifies everything."
"I am in Lille all year round, which is not the case in Belgium".
"It's time for me to start".
Hazard will come to Saint Denis, brought Friday night against Romania regarding the match against France, to finally "shine".
But without neglecting the note of "pleasure".
He joined the French national team at the age of 7 and led his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
"I have always been supported," he confirmed.
This inevitably contributes to reinforcing the "unique" character of this encounter.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he recalls.
"We just came across each other".
"To be allowed to play against them is great luck!"
Leekens for his part let "pride" resound with good-naturedness.
"The pride, a Galamatch" to carry out.
"Pride" also to confirm - in its capacity as a "neighbour" - that France "has again become a team at a very high level", a little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc did a damn good job," he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will be absent in the next European Championship, the technician sees himself sharing the plane with the Blue (the French national team)... towards Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians are coming out big," he stressed.
“We ’ re planning one thing, the players are ambitious, they ’ re hungry. ”
"You will notice this in the upcoming games." Included the game against France.
Portugal very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento looks forward with great optimism to the return leg against Bosnia (22: 00) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the first leg, both teams lacked objectivity.
"At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy team and above all a happy country".
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is not the slightest hint of doubt that "La Selecçao", his national team for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, in fact, this means only 90 minutes of bliss.
But there is one match to play, and one opponent to eliminate, and that is Bosnia.
In view of the match (0 “0 ”) on Friday in Zenica ’ s hell, it seems obvious that the dice have not yet been cast.
Portugal clearly dominated the match for more than an hour, but the team was not able to put the important stamp on the game, which would have relieved the pressure from it.
"This is a good result, but it involves a certain risk, since we have not achieved an exit gate".
At home, however, in their bright Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will make it through in front of an audience that is likely to be equally keen on the game, even if the game was of course announced as "very close", said the optimistic but clear-sighted Bento.
"We expect a very close match, but we are totally convinced that we can get the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance to be part of the European Championship 2012", however, qualified the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
The draw on Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
A draw can be enough for the Bosnians, who also need a goal.
"This is a good result, but it involves a certain risk, as we have not managed to reach an exit gate", regrets Bento.
"We will compete against a team that has high technical qualities and players with many individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese plan to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians right from the start in order to "give them no time to think."
This is a good idea, provided that it is put into practice this time.
