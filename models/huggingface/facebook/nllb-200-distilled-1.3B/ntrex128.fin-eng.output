Members of the Welsh House of Commons are afraid of looking stupid .
Some Members of the House of Representatives have been puzzled by the proposal to change their title to MWP, Member of the Welsh Parliament.
The summit was born out of a plan to change the name of the House of Representatives to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the House of Representatives, regardless of party line, are concerned that the change could make them the object of ridicule.
A Labour Party representative said the group was concerned that the name ribbed with the words Twp and Pwp.'
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means fool and pwp means poo.
A representative of the Plaid party said that the majority of the group was "not satisfied" and had proposed other alternatives.
The Conservative Party representative said his group was "very open minded" about the name change but noted that the word "MWP" was a short word for "stupid".
In Welsh, the letter w is pronounced in this context in a similar way to the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Commission, which is currently preparing the list of delegates for the legislative change in name, stated: The final decision on the names of the members of the delegation is, of course, for the members themselves.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 empowers the Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published a survey on the proposals, which showed broad support for the appointment of a representative to the Welsh Parliament.
The Commission preferred the term Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP for the members of the House of Representatives, but the MWP option received the most support in public opinion polls.
Members of the House of Representatives are obviously proposing alternative titles, but the lack of consensus could cause headaches for Speaker Elin Jones, who is expected to propose changes within weeks.
The amending legislation also contains other changes to the functioning of the delegation, such as the rules on the loss of the representative position and the composition of the committee system.
In legislative proceedings, Members of the House of Representatives may vote last on the title to which they should be addressed.
Macedonians go to the polls for a referendum on changing the country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the country's name to Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum aims to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which also has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long maintained that its northern neighbour's name is in effect a territorial claim on its territory and has repeatedly opposed its EU and NATO membership bids.
The Macedonian President, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price of EU and NATO membership.
The bells of St. Martin's are going silent as Harlem churches go through hard times.
"The elderly people I have spoken to say that there used to be a bar or a church on every street corner", says Adams.
Today, there is neither.
He said it was understandable that the bars were losing.
He said that "the way people interact has changed".
Bars are no longer communal living rooms in the neighbourhood where people gather regularly.
For the churches, he is concerned that the sale of property will not go as far as the leaders imagine, and sooner or later they will be back to square one.
He added that churches could be replaced by homes and apartments occupied by people who would not support the neighborhood's remaining shrines.
The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white, he says, and thus they will hasten the day when these churches will close their doors for good, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black neighborhood - the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martins a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930's.
A nearby congregation of blacks took ownership of the building.
St. Martins was taken over by a black congregation led by Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the 125th Street store on Harlem's Central Mall after the store owners objected to hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire severely damaged the building, and when Father Johnson's congregation was planning to rebuild, they installed a tower bell.
The Rev. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martins, proudly called the tower bell game "the bells of poverty".
The expert who played the bell in July called it by other names: a cultural treasure and an irreplaceable historical instrument.
Tiffany Ng, a University of Michigan expert, also noted that it was the world's first bell played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to play a larger bell in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martins didn't replace him.
In recent months, St. Martins has developed a complex construction industry, with lay leaders of the church and architects and contractors hired by the Episcopal Diocese.
Germany - the governing body of the congregation's lay leaders - wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese was trying to pass on the costs to Germany, even though Germany had not participated in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some congregants complained about a lack of transparency regarding the diocese.
A shark injured a 13-year-old lobster diver in California .
Authorities say a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobster on the opening day of lobster season in California.
The attack happened at Beacon's Beach in Encinitas just before 7:00 a.m.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and his friends were diving for about a half hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was just excited to catch a lobster, but then he realized he was screaming: 'I've been bitten!'
I was bitten!'
When Hammel reached the boy, he said that he noticed that his entire collarbone had been torn open.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: there's a shark in the water!" added the hammer.
The boy was flown to Raddy Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is reported to be critical.
The species of shark that attacked is unknown.
Lifeboat captain Larry Giles told a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier but was considered a harmless species.
Giles added that the victim sustained severe injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities have closed the beaches from Casablanca's Ponto Beach to Ecinitas' Swami for 48 hours for investigative and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but most are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's is planning to enter the UK beauty industry.
Sainsbury's is suing Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams in department store-style beauty departments staffed by expert advisors.
This is a major move for the UK's £2.8 billion beauty industry, which continues to grow despite sluggish sales of fashion and home goods, with larger beauty departments being trialled in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, expanded to other stores next year.
Investments in beauty products are being made as supermarkets try to fill the shelf space previously reserved for televisions, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's says its beauty line will double to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space and will have their own branded areas, similar to Boots stores.
The supermarket is also re-launching its boutique make-up range, with the majority of products to be vegan-friendly in future, as young shoppers increasingly demand it.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop is experimenting with rental stores at two Sainsbury's stores, the first opening last week in Croydon, South London, and the second opening at Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Internet shopping and the shift from grocery shopping to small, one-off purchases in local stores are forcing supermarkets to invent new attractions for customers.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe has said that stores will look more like department stores as the supermarket chain struggles to compete with discount stores like Aldi and Lidl by adding services and non-food products.
Since buying both chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos stores in its stores, as well as Habitat stores, which the company says has boosted food sales and made the acquisitions profitable.
The supermarket failed in its last attempt to revamp its beauty and pharmacy departments.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended in a dispute over how the profits of the pharmacies located in the supermarkets should be shared.
The new strategy follows a corporate takeover where Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125 million three years ago.
The company said Lloyds is part of a plan to expand its range of luxury skincare products to four stores under brands such as La Roche-Posey and Vichy.
Sainsbury's Chief Commercial Officer Paul Mills-Hicks said: "We have changed the look and feel of our beauty departments to improve the customer experience.
We have also invested in specially trained staff who are ready to advise clients.
Our range of brands caters for all needs and our attractive environment and convenient location make us an attractive beauty shop that challenges the traditional way of shopping.
Peter Jones, furious after Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11 million contract.
Dragons Den star Peter Jones has left "in a rage" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home-grown food and clothing brand Truly.
The two companies have been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning announced his departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has angered Dragons Den star Peter Jones by withdrawing from their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her new giant deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "angry" at a tense meeting last Tuesday at the headquarters of the Jones business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, after the TV star admitted that her new £1.5 million deal would not leave enough time for their home-food and clothing brand Truly.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was predicted to double Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune.
After 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
According to one source, "Truly was clearly Holly's most important project.
It was his long-term plan to ensure his livelihood for the next two decades.
His decision to leave has left everyone in awe.
No one could believe Tuesday's events so close to release.
Marlow's headquarters has a warehouse full of products waiting to be sold.
The host of This Morning is one of Britain's most lucrative stars, and experts say his departure could cost the company millions in product investments, from pillows to candles and clothing to household goods, not to mention a delay in publication.
It could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close for about ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby organized Capp Truly in 2016 and Jones, 52, became chairman in March.
The couples are vacationing together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is being crowned M&S's new brand ambassador and replaces Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night that we would not comment on his business dealings.
♪ We had a tough talk and then we fell in love ♪
He joked about the criticism he would receive in the media for his comments, which some would consider inappropriate for the president, and his positive attitude toward the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said, pretending to be a news anchor.
I didn't give up a single one.
He noted that Kim was interested in meeting again after Trump had touted the first meeting in July as a major step towards North Korean denuclearisation.
But the nuclear talks have been a disaster.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in July, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North sees no "responsiveness" from the US to North Korea's early disarmament efforts.
He said the US would instead continue its sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump had a much more optimistic view of the future in his speech.
"We are doing very well with North Korea", he said.
We were on the verge of war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have such a great relationship.
He said efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results, with missile tests stopped, hostages freed and the remains of American soldiers returned home.
He also defended his unusual style when talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of trying to get 10,000 more people out into this crowded hall, we would have about 200 people standing right here", Trump said, pointing directly at the crowd in front of him.
Indonesian tsunami and earthquake devastate island, hundreds dead
For example, in the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, several foreign volunteer organizations were told that they were not needed.
A national emergency requiring international assistance was not declared, even though some 10 percent of Lombok's inhabitants were left homeless.
In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they will not seek international assistance, so the situation is a bit challenging, said Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is forming a traveling team to Palus, it is not certain whether foreign staff can work in the field.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said Indonesian authorities were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organizations would be allowed to participate in the relief effort.
Indonesia is still unfortunately unprepared to face natural forces, given the regular recurrence of earthquakes.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are still rare in other coastal areas.
The loss of life in Bali was likely due to the absence of a tsunami warning siren, even though the warning was in effect.
Traveling between Indonesia's numerous islands is challenging even under the best of conditions.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
The hospital ship assigned to assist earthquake victims in Lombok is en route to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster area.
President Joko Widodo made the development of Indonesia's worn-out infrastructure the focus of his election campaign and has poured money into improving roads and railways.
However, the administration has been plagued by a lack of funding as new elections approach next year.
Adding to the pressure are tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has adopted a more conservative form of religion.
Christian and Muslim gangs have engaged in street fighting with jungle knives, bows and arrows, and other primitive weapons, resulting in more than 1,000 deaths and tens of thousands of displaced persons.
Look , Liverpool 's Daniel Sturridge has sunk a late draw against Chelsea .
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from relegation on Saturday after scoring an 89th-minute goal against Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge was given a free kick by Xherdan Shaqiri 27 yards from the goal as his side were on the losing side.
He moved the ball to the left before he was scared off by the shot to the rear post.
The shot was hovering high above the penalty area towards the right upper corner.
Finally, the ball landed on the pitching Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to make myself playable to get the ball and players like Shaq always play as high up as possible, so I was just trying to make as much time as possible for myself", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante approaching, I took one touch and fired without thinking too much.
Chelsea took the lead at half-time 1-0 after a goal from Belgian Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward gave a free kick to Mateo Kovacic before he spiraled off the field and sped into Liverpool's midfield.
Kovacic was playing a fastball in the middle of the field.
Then he released Hazard into the penalty area with a spectacular passing touch.
Hazard escaped the defence and passed Liverpool's Alisson Becker with a shot in the left foot in the back corner.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 15:00 at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea are set to face Videotone in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3pm in London.
Indonesian tsunami death toll rises to 832
Indonesia's disaster agency said early Sunday that the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami had risen to 832.
At a press conference, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo said that many were trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings when a 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck on Friday, raising waves up to 20 feet [6 m] high.
The debris from the collapsed buildings spread widely over the city of Palun, with a population of 380,000.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after finding a woman stabbed to death in a nearby house.
A woman's body found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning has prompted a murder investigation.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking anyone who was in the area to report if they saw or heard anything.
Crime Commissioner Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation is in its early stages but I would urge anyone who has been in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead to contact the police if they have seen or heard anything.
I also call on anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the dashboard to contact the police, who may have vital information for the investigation.
A female police spokeswoman has confirmed that the woman found dead is from Birkenhead and that her body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, people who may have known her came to the scene and asked where she was found.
As the investigation continues, police say they will endeavor to inform the victim's family of what happened.
A cab driver in Grayson Mews had just tried to get back to his apartment, but police had told him no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he learned what had happened.
Residents have just been informed that it could be hours before they're allowed back in.
An officer was overheard telling the man that the entire area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene, tearful.
He said it again and again, "It's terrible".
By 2 p.m., there were two huts in the isolated area, and a third outside.
There were several police officers in the isolated area, guarding the apartment building.
Anyone with information is asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, dial 101 or dial Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 using the code 247 on September 30.
The Cromwell statue in Parliament was also part of a rewrite of history
The removal of the statue would be a poetic justice, given that his own fanatical Puritan supporters destroyed England's cultural and religious monuments like the best of the Taliban.
However, the Cromwellian Society described Crick's proposal as "foolish" and "a rewrite of history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the ongoing debate on the removal of statues would make a painting of the statue of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster a target.
Cromwell neither ordered nor implemented the iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars.
The wrong Cromwell may suffer the consequences of the actions of his ancestor Thomas, who lived in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent description of Cromwell reflects 19th-century views and is historical evidence of a figure still held in high esteem by many.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, perhaps more so in the 19th century than today, regard Cromwell as the defender of Parliament against the external pressure, in this case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is an accurate description of the subject is a subject of ongoing historical debate.
It is certain, at least, that the controversy of the mid-17th century has shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell must be identified as a figure who represents the other side of that division.
In addition, her achievements as a public nurse deserve to be commended and remembered.
A Chinese farmer was killed by a serial killer.
Local media report that a pig attacked and killed a farmer at a market in southwest China.
The body of a man identified only by his surname Yuan was found near a pig farm in Liupanshuin Square in Guizhou province, with a ruptured aorta and covered in blood, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs in a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He was reported to have traveled with his cousin from nearby Yunnan Province on Wednesday with the intention of selling 15 pigs at a market.
His cousin found him dead the next morning, and he also noticed that the door to the nearby pigsty was open.
In the woods, he said he saw a big cow with blood in its mouth.
According to the news, a forensic investigation confirmed the death of a farmer who was killed by a 250-pound cow.
The Guiyang Evening News reports that a cousin named Wu said that my cousin's legs were bloody and bruised.
Security footage shows a cousin arriving at the market to feed pigs at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
One of the market managers told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent it from harming others while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the mall officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for the death.
Pigs have been known to attack humans before, although this is rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the husband.
Ten years earlier, a nearly 1,000-pound pig had been wedged against the tractor of a Welsh farmer until his wife managed to scare the animal away.
After a pig farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that while pigs are not usually aggressive, the taste of blood can be a "trigger".
They're just a game.
They're like little children, very curious, and they don't mean to hurt.
He said they just had to be respected appropriately.
Hurricane Rosa 's debris is bringing heavy rain to the southeastern United States .
Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cooler waters of Mexico's north coast, as predicted.
However, Rosa will bring floodwaters to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 125 feet [38 m] per second, a Category 1 hurricane, at 5 a.m. on Sunday, east coast time, and was located 400 miles [620 km] southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The Rossa is expected to move north on Sunday.
While a low pressure is forming over the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States, Rosa will begin to push deep tropical moisture northward toward the southwestern United States as it makes landfall on the California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm.
Rosa will bring as much as a quarter inch [250 mm] of rain to some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, interacting with the approaching low pressure, tropical moisture will form extensive wetlands in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 25 to 100 millimetres of rainfall can cause dangerous heavy rainfall and potentially landslides in the desert.
The deep tropical humidity causes 50 to 75 millimeters of rain per hour in certain areas, especially in Nevada and Arizona.
Some areas of the southwest, especially Arizona, are forecast to receive up to 50 to 100 millimeters of rain.
Heavy rainfall is possible and conditions can deteriorate rapidly due to tropical rain dispersion.
When threatened by tropical rain, it is strongly recommended to avoid going out into the desert on foot.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into flowing rivers, and thunderstorms produce local gusty winds and flying dust.
An approaching low pressure area is bringing local heavy rainfall to the coastal areas of Southern California.
Rainfall of more than 10 millimetres is possible, causing small streams of waste and slippery roads.
It would be the first rains of the rainy season in the region.
Scattered tropical showers will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday until the rains widen during Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners area Tuesday and last through Wednesday.
Throughout the United States, October will see dramatic temperature swings as the Arctic cools but the tropics remain fairly warm.
This sometimes causes large temperature fluctuations over short distances.
Central United States is a prime example of high temperature variations on Sundays.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, as well as Nebraska, St. Louis, and Des Moines, Iowa, is nearly 80 degrees Fahrenheit [20°C].
The lingering heat of summer will tend to intensify and expand again in the coming days.
Early October is expected to be broadly warm in the central and eastern United States, with temperatures reaching +26 degrees Fahrenheit [26°C] from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York City, temperatures could reach +26 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 4 degrees warmer than average.
Our long-term forecast is that the eastern United States has a good chance of higher than average temperatures in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh hearing .
More than 20 million watched a television broadcast on Tuesday by six television stations, in which Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and his 1980s sex offender Christine Blasey Ford gave fascinating testimony.
Meanwhile, the political standoff continued as television networks suspended their broadcasts in a last-minute twist that the FBI is conducting a week-long investigation into the allegations under a deal brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100% certain that a drunk Kavanaugh had grabbed him and tried to strip him at a high school prom.
Kavanaugh, for his part, gave an emotional statement saying he was 100% certain that this did not happen.
The audience was likely higher than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported on Friday.
The company calculated the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures for other channels that broadcast the event, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen often has difficulty measuring the audience viewing in its offices.
Something about the ratio tells us that it's the same as the number of people watching a football game or the Oscars.
Of all the television networks, Nielsen said the highest ratings were seen by Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, averaging 5.69 million viewers during the day's hearing.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
After the hearing, interest was still high.
Friday night, the drama centered on Flake.
CNN and CBS cameras captured him being escorted into the elevator by the shouts of protesters on his way to a hearing on the Judiciary Committee on Friday, after moderate Republican backbenchers had previously announced he would vote for Kavanaugh.
CNN showed him standing for a few minutes, staring down at the sky as the thunderbolts flew.
"I'm standing right in front of you", said a woman.
Do you believe he'll tell the people the truth?
And they said to her, Thou hast power, and many women have no power.
Flake said his office had issued a statement, adding before the elevator doors closed that he had more to say after hearing the committee.
Hours later, cable and broadcast networks broadcast live as the Judiciary Committee began voting on whether to put Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote in the Senate.
Flake, however, said he would only act on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the candidate next week, as the minority Democrats have demanded.
Flake was convinced of the part by his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, based on discussions he had with him.
Flake made his decision after consulting with Coons and several other senators.
The Flake choice was powerful because it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of politicizing Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May in an interview with the Sunday Times accused those who criticized her plans to leave the EU of politicizing the country, which threatens the future of Britain and its national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
The newspaper's front page also published a second interview in which her former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, continued his attack on May's so-called Chequers plan, calling the proposal for Britain and the EU to levy tariffs on each other's imports "totally absurd".
Police have arrested Dytheon Simpson on suspicion of the death of an LSU quarterback .
Police have arrested a man on suspicion of the shooting death of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and taken to the county jail, where he is being charged with second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released a video of Sims and Simpson's dispute, in which police say Sims lost his glasses.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, WAFB reports.
Police say Simpson admitted to shooting Wayde in the interrogation.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to the Advocate.
The East Baton Rouge County coroner released a preliminary report Friday that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The Bureau would like to thank the Louisiana State Police Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and local residents for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU's sporting director, Joe Alleva, thanked law enforcement for their "immediateness and justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-2 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, played basketball at LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning he was "appalled" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"You're always afraid of something like this happening", Wayde said.
A volcano spews ash over Mexico City .
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern residential areas of Mexico City.
On Saturday, Mexico's Disaster Management Center urged people to stay away from the volcano as the crater intensified and 183 gas and ash eruptions were recorded during the day.
The center is registering a tremor and a tremor several times.
Social media posted pictures of car windshields covered in a thin layer of ash in residential areas like Xochimilco, Mexico City.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity in a volcano located 45 miles [72 km] southwest of the capital, Mexico City, after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck the country in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police and Catalan separatists join forces ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday in clashes between pro-independence protesters and riot police, thousands of people taking part in competing demonstrations on the first anniversary of the split vote.
Police detained a group of masked pro-independence protesters who threw eggs and powder paint at the police, which formed dark dust clouds on the normally crowded streets.
More riots broke out during the day as police used their pampas to contain the bandits.
The clashes between pro-independence and unionist groups continued for several hours, with the former shouting 'No forgetting, no forgiveness' and the latter 'Long live Spain'.
Local media report that 14 people have received treatment for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
Tensions remain high in the pro-independence region, a year after the referendum on 1 October, which Madrid declared illegal but which Catalan separatists are celebrating.
Voters voted for independence by a clear majority, although turnout was low in the opposition boycott.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when police tried to block voting at polling stations across the region.
Pro-independence groups stayed out all night on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was nevertheless organized, but it had to go the other way.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in a separatist demonstration with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about Catalonia's independence.
Last year was one of the best years of our lives.
I saw my parents crying for the joy of being able to vote, but now we are stuck in our seats, she says.
Despite a narrow but crucial victory in the regional elections in December, the momentum of pro-independence parties in Catalonia has slowed this year, with many of the most prominent leaders in voluntary exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed a pro-police demonstration on her phone, says politicians on both sides fanned the flames.
"The situation is getting worse", he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in custody since last year, announced his intention to stand in next year's European Parliament elections.
'Candidating for the Eurovision Song Contest is the best way to condemn the destruction of democratic values and the oppression we have seen at the hands of the Spanish government', he says.
Londonderry: men arrested after car crashed into house
The men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car was said to have repeatedly collided with a house in Londonderry.
Events continued in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 7:30pm British time.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building were damaged.
The car may have been hit with a crossbow at some point.
Livingston beat the Rangers 1-0 with a Menga goal.
Dolly Mangan's first goal in Livingston secured the win.
Livingston's series-winning goal has stunned Rangers, and has only caused Steven Gerrard his second defeat in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Mengan's goal finally won the game as Gary Holt's team moved into second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's crew have missed their first home Premiership win of the season and will now face Championship champions Hearts on Sunday, who are eight points clear.
The Rangers are still in the middle of a game against Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, has gone on a six-game unbeaten streak, and head coach Holt has not lost a game since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston lost his seat to a blade-deficient visitor.
Holt should have led the team long before he scored after causing the Rangers a lot of trouble with his line.
Scott Robinson broke through, but the finish was wide, and then Alan Lithgow got to slide in with a goal from Craig Halkett's shot, but he passed the ball.
The hosts were happy to hand over control of the ball to the Rangers because they knew they could vaccinate for special occasions.
And the big goal came out just like that.
The Rangers gave Livingston a free kick, from which Declan Gallagher and Robinson gave Menga a place to move the ball into the middle of the penalty area and finish.
The Rangers had the ball in their hands by then, but they said the home team was holding the defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely allowed to try.
The same pattern continued into the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to withdraw.
Rangers goalie Allan McGregor blocked Scott Pittman's attempt and Lithgow passed the ball in another special Livingston situation.
The rain of concentrations on Livingston's penalty area was continually being cleared, and two occasions were called for a missed penalty kick, Halkett's tackle of substitute Glenn Middleton and a ball that hit his arm.
Great performance from Livingston - analysis
The BBC Scotland broadcast at the Alasdair Lamont Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and score from Livingston.
The team continued to exceed expectations and was excellent to every player, continuing through the ascending lines.
The way the team plays and the crew have not changed much since they returned to the top level.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was brilliant in leading a superbly organized defense, with Menga keeping Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes the entire game.
The Rangers, though, they lacked ideas.
The team has performed very well under Gerrard from time to time, but now it is far from his standard.
The last pitch was tied, and they managed to open the home team's defense just once, which should be a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are the middle of the table.
Erdogan received a mixed reception in Cologne
The smile was on the face of the earth and the sky was blue on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at improving relations between the NATO allies.
There have been disagreements on human rights and press freedom as well as Turkey's EU efforts.
Erdogan continued his journey to Cologne to open a giant new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police prevented a crowd of 25,000 supporters from gathering outside the mosque, citing security concerns, but a large crowd of supporters still gathered nearby to watch the president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - also raised their voices, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to invite him back to the country.
The competing demonstrations reflect a division of opinion, with some Turkish Germans hailing him as a hero while others deride him as an autocrat.
A cyclist has died in a collision with a car.
A cyclist died after being hit by a car in London.
The accident occurred at approximately 0200 hours local time in the southwest part of Deptford, near the busy intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street.
The driver of the car stopped and medical personnel came to the victim's aid, but the man died at the scene.
A few months earlier another cyclist had died in a traffic accident on Childers Street, about a mile from the scene of the accident on Saturday.
The city police say they're working to identify the man and notify his family.
Roadblocks have been put in place and bus traffic has been diverted, and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lart prison: Six guards injured in riots
Prison officials say six guards were injured in a high-security prison riot.
The riots began at HMP Long Lart Prison in Worcestershire at around 0930 on Sunday, British time, and are still continuing.
Tornado Special Branch has been brought in to quell the unrest, which has seen eight inmates in a single cell.
The officers' minor facial injuries were treated at the scene.
A prison administration spokesman said: "HMP Long Lart has sent specially trained prison staff to deal with the situation.
Six members of the staff have been treated for their injuries.
We do not condone violence in our prisons and it is clear that those responsible will be taken into police custody and may have to spend longer behind bars.
HMP Long Lart has over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
The warden was reportedly hospitalized in June after being attacked by one of the prisoners.
In addition, riot police were called to the prison in October for serious disturbances involving attacks on staff with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa brings severe flood threat to Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (Drought zones may benefit)
Tropical low pressure is rare in Arizona, but that is exactly what is happening early next week as the remnants of Hurricane Rosa move across the southwestern desert, bringing with it the risk of heavy rainfall.
The National Weather Service has already issued a severe flood warning for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, as well as the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving Monday in the form of rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that only only 10 tropical storms have maintained a tropical storm or low pressure state within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was still 40 miles [65 km] from the Arizona border.
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 50 to 100 millimeters of rain, with up to 150 millimeters in some places on the Mogollon Range in Arizona.
In other parts of the southwestern desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, the actual rainfall is between 25 and 50 millimeters, with some areas receiving up to 100 millimeters.
Pink rains can also be a blessing in a drought-stricken area if there is no danger of heavy rainfall.
Although the floods pose a serious threat, some of the rain may also be beneficial, since the southwest has suffered from severe drought.
According to the U.S. Bureau of Drought, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category, reports weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will make its first landfall on the California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, located 400 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, is still a hurricane with winds of 85 miles per hour, moving north at 13 miles per hour.
The storm loses its strength when it hits cooler waters in the Pacific.
It is therefore expected to make landfall as a strong tropical storm in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening.
In parts of Mexico, the rains can be heavy and pose a significant risk of flooding.
From the California peninsula to northwestern Sonora, 75 to 150 millimeters are expected, with up to 250 millimeters possible, reports weather.com.
Rosa then continues its journey through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border as a tropical depression in the early hours of Tuesday morning, from where it will continue its journey through Arizona and south into Utah late Tuesday evening.
The greatest risk of Rosa or its remnants is associated with very heavy rains in the California peninsula, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States, says the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening floods and sewage flows in deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack , four arrests for attempted murder .
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found with multiple gunshot wounds in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at 4:00am on Saturday morning, British time.
He was taken to a hospital where he is reported to be in "stable" condition.
Police say they have made arrests overnight of a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man in the Radstock area of Avon and Somerset.
Police are asking for any contact with anyone who may have video footage of the incident recorded on a mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh has experienced the "violence and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"My vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and shameful methods of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered from the Democratic Party's harshness and anger throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying the allegation made by Christine Blasey Ford of sexual harassment that would have occurred decades ago in their teenage years.
Ford also testified at the hearing about his accusation.
The president said on Saturday that the American people saw Kavanaugh's brilliance, character and courage that day.
"My vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh's nomination is a vote for one of the most distinguished legal scholars of our time with an outstanding record of public service", he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president made an indirect reference to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections.
We're five weeks away from the most important election of our lifetimes.
Not just campaigning, but campaigning full-time", he said.
That's why I'm going all over the place to fight for the best candidates.
Trump claimed that the Democrats had made it their mission to "resist and inhibit".
A senior aide to the Republican leadership told CNN that the first major vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to be in the Senate by Friday.
Hundreds dead in Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, death toll expected to rise
Authorities said Saturday that at least 384 people died after a massive earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, many washed up on the beaches as huge waves hit.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the town of Puh on Friday when waves as high as 20 feet [6 m] hit the beach in the evening, and many were washed away to their deaths as the waves destroyed everything in their path.
The tsunami caused a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately flee, becoming its victims, reports Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB disaster mitigation agency in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it took cars, logs, houses and hit the whole country", says Nugroho, adding that the tsunami reached 800 kilometres per hour on the open sea before hitting the coast.
Some people survived the tsunami by climbing trees, he says.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palus.
Aerial photos released by the Disaster Management Agency show several destroyed houses and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
The tremors were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Bureau of Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) issued a statement saying that the energy released in Friday's massive earthquake was equivalent to about 200 atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It says that the terrain of a city at the end of a long and narrow bay could inflate a tsunami.
Nugroho described the destruction as "extensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said that some bodies had been found in the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be higher than the one seen 300 kilometers north of Palus in the coastal area of Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter.
Communications are completely cut off and no information has been received from Donggala", Nugroho said.
The Red Cross said in a statement that more than 300,000 people live there, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the area.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse, he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not reporting that the tsunami had hit Palu, although authorities said the waves arrived during the warning.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the upper floors of a building is loudly shouting warnings of an approaching tsunami to people on the street.
Minutes later, a wall of water hits the beach, taking buildings and cars with it.
Reuters was not immediately able to verify the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused widespread power outages that cut off communications around Pula, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Officials say that the army has begun sending aid from Jakarta and other cities by transport planes, but evacuees are still in dire need of food and other basic supplies.
The city's airport has been reopened for relief operations only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centers of Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has exceeded 800.
It's really bad.
World Vision Donggala staff have been taken to safety in the city of Palun, where they have been housed in tented shelters in the office's courtyard, Doseba said.
'They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,' he says.
It's really bad.
As the relief groups began their daunting task, some complained that foreign aid workers were being prevented from traveling to Palus.
The Indonesian authorities have decided to suspend the operation of the airport until the end of the year.
This has not happened yet.
It is still a provincial catastrophe, says Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
As soon as the government says OK, this is a national disaster, we can start receiving international aid, but the declaration has not yet been made.
As another night fell on Palun after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, the friends and family of the missing cherished the hope that their loved ones would miraculously deviate from the bleak story of the natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who had been in the rubble for two days beside her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national volleyball team, had trained two missing volleyball players for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month.
Mandagi says that his students were also trapped in the Roa Roa hotel.
As a parent of an addict, I have my own emotional burden, she says.
Gendon says he tried desperately to reach the beach festival's Pju competitors via WhatsApp messages after news of the Roa Roa hotel collapse spread among the hang-gliding community.
However, after the messages he sent, only one gray sign appeared instead of two blue ones.
I understand that means that the messages were not delivered, he says.
The thieves stole $26,750 from a cash machine at Newport on the Leve .
On Friday morning, $26,750 was taken from a Brink's security guard while he was refilling an ATM at the Newport on the Leve, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car had been emptying and refilling an ATM at the entertainment center, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While the Brink's employee was distracted, a man ran after him and stole the bag of money that was to be delivered.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several people fleeing the scene, but police did not specify their number.
Anyone with information about their identities is asked to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: a character formerly known as Kanye West.
Ye has been West's nickname for some time, and he used it as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes ahead of her upcoming appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to release her new album titled Yandhi.
She replaces singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the show's creator, withdrew from the show for "emotional reasons".
West has previously said that the word has religious meaning for him as well as being an abbreviation of his professional name.
In discussing the album's title with radio host Big Boy earlier this year, West said that he believed ye was the most common word in the Bible, and that it meant you.
So I'm you, us, and all of us.
It started with Kany, which means unique, and ended up with the short form Ye, which just expresses the good, the bad, the confused, everything in us.
The album is mostly a reflection on who we are.
He's one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known variously as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but announced this year that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former partner, Jay-Z, has also occasionally removed and restored the hyphen and capital letters.
Mexico 's AMLO pledges not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's president-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians, as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the student riots.
Lopez Obrador, speaking in Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday, vowed never to use the army to oppress the Mexican people.
Armed forces opened fire on a peaceful demonstration on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by offering monthly scholarships and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drive young people into criminal gangs.
Federal governments should double funding for AI research
The United States should double its spending on AI research as China ramps up its efforts, says Kai-Fu Lee, a financier and AI professional who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The statement was preceded by communications on AI from various parts of the US administration, despite the lack of a formal AI strategy in the US.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: to become the leading developer of artificial intelligence by 2030.
Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that other countries are so far behind the US and that we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI, says Lee.
Doubling funding could double the likelihood that the next major AI breakthrough will be in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee's book, "The Great Powers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order", was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, an editor at Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's leading AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he developed an AI system at Carnegie Mellon University that beat the highest ranked Othello player in the United States.
Lee acknowledged the U.S. administration's previous technology competitions, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects and the Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be held to identify future visionaries.
Lee says that U.S. researchers worked hard to secure public funding.
'China is not exporting academic influencers, but big companies,' Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been recruiting top academics to work on AI in recent years.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the United States to increase its AI efforts.
I think that PhDs in AI should be given automatic green cards, he said.
The State Council of China presented its next-generation AI development plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding for people working in academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide money for U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is poorer in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Defense Department Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
DARPA also announced this month a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF, on the other hand, invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the bill to establish a national security commission on artificial intelligence has been stalled for months.
Macedonians vote on changing the country's name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a change that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked its bids to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, considers the name of its northern neighbour to be a territorial claim on its territory and has therefore opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
The governments of the countries signed an agreement on the new name proposal in June, but nationalist opponents say the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov has announced that he will not vote in the referendum and the campaign against the vote raises doubts as to whether the voter turnout will reach the 50% threshold required for the result to be legal.
The question on the ballot was: 'Do you support NATO and EU membership by approving the agreement with Greece?'
Supporters of the name change, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying so that Macedonia, which emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, can aspire to membership in both the EU and NATO.
I came today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live in freedom as members of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us, said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough Members have said they respect the outcome of the vote to have a decisive impact.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
According to the Central Election Commission, as of 1 p.m., there had been no irregularities reported.
However, turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of eligible voters actually cast their ballots.
I came to vote for my children and our place in Europe, said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in a referendum on the name change of Macedonia in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018. The name change would pave the way for NATO and EU membership.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, set up a small stage and set up chairs in front of the tents erected by the boycott of the referendum in front of the Skopje parliament.
We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join up, not through the kitchen door", said Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn elsewhere, such as to China and Russia as part of the integration of the euro area.
The European Union is committed to the fight against terrorism and to the fight against terrorism.
'I believe that a large majority will vote for the name change because more than 80% of our citizens support the EU and NATO,' Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said that the 'yes' vote was the 'yes' to our future.
An opinion poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research indicated a turnout of 30-43 percent in the referendum - below the required turnout.
In a second poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said they would vote yes.
For a referendum to succeed, turnout must exceed 50% by one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious setback for the pro-Western government since it came to power in May last year.
Look , Sergio Aguero of Manchester City has beaten the whole Brighton defence with a goal .
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling have made a clear mark in Brighton's defence in a 2-0 win over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero made his goal in the 65th minute look ridiculously easy.
At the beginning of the picture, the Argentine striker was given a free kick by the center.
He found the empty space on the pitch by attacking through three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed one defender past and then left behind several others on the edge of the Brighton penalty area.
Then he found Sterling by passing the ball to the left.
The English striker used his first touch from inside the penalty area to return the ball to Aguerot, who passed Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan's goal with a shot into the right corner.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters that Aguero has problems with his feet.
We talked about him playing 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
Luckily for us, he scored in that time.
However, Sterling had already given the Sky Blues an advantage in the league.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball in the back of the net deep in Brighton.
He gave Leroy San a nice, hard pass on the left side.
Sane made a few touches before he sent the ball to Sterling's rear post.
The Blue Devils forward hit the net just before the end zone.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to be the fun spoiler in the game against the Rockies .
The Nationals are out of the playoffs, so why go all-out to get into the starting lineup?
Still competitive, Scherzer hopes to take the puck in Sunday's game against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a playoff spot, one win away from the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Conference.
The Rockies have at least captured a wild card with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still aiming for their first division title.
Even if we don't have a shot, at least we can get on the pitch knowing that the atmosphere of the crowd and the other team here in Denver is creating for me the most demanding competitive environment I've faced this year.
Why wouldn't I want to take the challenge?
The Nationals have not yet released their starting pitcher for Sunday, but they are reportedly inclined to give Scherzer a shot under the circumstances.
Scherzer pitched in practice Thursday, starting his 34th game and pitching on Sunday in his regular break.
Washington's right-hander has an 18-7 win-loss record this season, an ERA of 2.53, and he's struck out 300 times with 220 2/3 innings.
Trump is campaigning in West Virginia .
The President made a direct reference to the situation of his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, while also speaking of the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections.
All our achievements are at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from the most important election of our lifetimes.
This is one of the really big ones -- I'm not just campaigning, I'm campaigning full-on, and that's why I'm going all over the place to fight for great candidates", he said.
Trump continued, "You see this terrible, terrible group of radical Democrats, you see it happening right now.
They are determined to return to power by any means necessary, and you can see their malice and their malice.
They don't choose who they want to hurt or who they need to push to get to power, and what they want is power and power, but we're not giving it to them.
He said the Democrats had made it their task to 'resist and prevent'.
'And it has been evident over the last four days', he said, calling the Democrats 'angry and mean and malicious and lying'.
When he referred to the longest-serving Democratic senator on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Dianne Feinstein, the audience responded with loud boos.
Do you remember what he said?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
Well, uh no, wait a minute -- that was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer a tolerant parish.
It doesn't tolerate people who speak their mind.
I wasn't really surprised when the activists from my local Momentum party voted to vote no on me.
I mean, I'm the last, just the last, in a line of Labour representatives to be told I'm not welcome just because we're saying what we think.
My colleague Joan Ryan was treated in the same way simply because she was a strong opponent of anti-Semitism.
In my case, the no-confidence motion was a criticism of my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On topics relating to responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar topics on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour Conference said on Friday that it wanted its meetings to be inclusive and productive.
For most of the eight years I have been a local Labour representative, the Friday meetings of the party council have been just that.
Now many in the House do not follow that tone, and a more friendly and gentle policy has long been forgotten, if it ever began.
It is becoming clearer that the Labour Party no longer tolerates differences of opinion and that each opinion is evaluated on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the leadership.
This started soon after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues who thought I shared the same political views began to expect me to make a complete change and to adopt positions which I would never have accepted otherwise, whether on national security or the EU internal market.
Every time I speak in public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - the result is a flurry of insults on social media, demanding that I withdraw my election, reject the Centre's policies and be told that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments made on me are at least political in nature.
I have great respect for the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face sexist and racist insults on a daily basis and never waver.
The normalization of abuse is one of the most disturbing features of politics in this era.
Last week Jeremy Corbyn demanded that the Labour Party should adopt a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party that accepts different opinions, and with each vote of no confidence or change in the electoral code, the party becomes more limited.
For two years I have been told to keep a low profile and to refrain from expressing my thoughts so that everything goes smoothly.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since joining the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago as a result of the Thatcher government's neglect of the comprehensive school system, I have worked as a councillor and as a minister to promote better public services for those who need them most.
I've never hidden my political line, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could possibly be surprised by my views or my disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who supported the initiative last Friday, I want to say that as the country moves towards a Brexit that will harm households, businesses and public services, I do not see the need to waste time and energy in questioning my confidence in the leadership of the Labour Party.
But my real message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents: I represent you with honor, and the threat of dismissal or the prospect of a political career will not stop me from acting in a way that I believe is in your best interests.

Ayr to Melrose 38-17 , undefeated at Ayr Block Top .
The two last-minute goals slightly distorted the outcome, but Ayr undoubtedly earned a win in the day's entertaining Tennent's Premiership game.
Ayr are now at the top of the table as the only team in the top 10 to have never lost a game.
A great defense and a more successful risk-taking were what ultimately worked for them, and Coach Peter Murchie can be rightly pleased.
We have been challenged in our matches and we are still unbeaten, so I can be satisfied. he says.
Melrose Robyn Christie says, "All credit to Ayr, they took risks better than we did".
Ayr took the lead at 14 minutes with a goal from Grant Anderson and a successful conversion kick from Frazier Climo, but a yellow card from Scotland captain Roy Hughes, given by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to rise, and Jason Baggot scored.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty kick and just before halftime he scored and managed a conversion kick to increase Ayr's lead to 17-5.
But Melrose started the second period well with a Patrick Anderson goal, which Baggot managed to convert, narrowing the gap to five points.
The match was delayed for a long time when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and carried off the field.
Ayr captain Blair Macpherson was given a yellow card after Melrose's Bruce Colvine made a goal after a hard pressing shot that failed to convert.
However, the home side responded when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for tackling a ballless Climo and Macpherson scored from a free kick from behind Ayr's goal.
Climo made the conversion kick in the same way as before, and Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's kick and swiped Gregor Henry to complete the home team's fifth goal.
The star of "Still Game" is starting out in the restaurant business.
Still Game star Ford Kieran has been named CEO of a licensed restaurant company, launching a career in the restaurant industry.
The 56-year-old actor will play Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show he's writing with comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the series' last, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning her life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he's listed as a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor himself declined to comment on the details, but a source in the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was keen to join Glasgow's booming restaurant business.
The sea is ours: Bolivia's inland state tries to regain access to the Pacific Ocean through legal means
Sailors are patrolling outside the naval base in La Paz.
The flag of the United States is flown on the flagpole of a public building.
The naval bases from Titicaca to the Amazon are littered with the slogan: "The sea rightfully belongs to us.
It's our duty to get it back.
Inland in Bolivia, Chile still has a strong memory of the shoreline lost in the bloody resource wars of the 19th century  and a longing to sail the Pacific once more.
Hopes are at their highest in decades as Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberation.
'Bolivia has a strong belief in progress, a spirit of unity and composure, and of course a positive attitude in the face of a final solution,' said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians across the country are watching the International Court of Justice ruling from the big screens with hope that the Hague will end  decades of disrupted debate  Bolivia's position on Chile's obligation to grant Bolivia autonomous access to the sea.
Bolivia's charismatic president, Evo Morales, facing a contentious re-election battle next year, has a lot at stake in the lineup next Monday.
The return to the Pacific is very close, he assured in late August.
However, some analysts believe that the court's decision is unlikely to be in Bolivia's best interest, and even if it were, it would not make much difference.
The Dutch-backed UN body has no authority to hand over Chilean administrative areas and the ICJ has said it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ's decision comes just six months after the final opinions are given suggests that the case is not complicated, says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Moreover, the last four years have slowed down rather than helped Bolivia's intentions.
The current Bolivian government has hijacked the issue of maritime connectivity, said Zárate.
He said Morales's defiant rhetoric had stifled the rest of Chile's goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the discussions at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold negotiations after that.
Neither country has had an embassy in the other since 1962.
The former president and Bolivian representative in The Hague, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, does not accept the view that the court's decision was exceptionally swift.
He said Monday would give Bolivia 'an exceptional opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile' and 'to end 139 years of disagreement for mutual benefit'.
Calzadilla also denies that Morales, one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the maritime issue as political support.
'Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,' he added.
The decision is an opportunity to understand that it is time to move on from the past.
North Korea has announced that nuclear disarmament will not take place unless it can trust the United States.
North Korea will not give up its nuclear weapons first unless they can trust Washington, said North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho.
Ri was speaking at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He also called on the United States to keep the promises made by the leaders at the Singapore summit.
Rin's statement comes just before US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is to resume deadlock diplomacy on nuclear weapons, just three months after the US met Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said it was a "distant dream" to believe that continued sanctions and US opposition to the declaration of an end to the Korean War would bring North Korea to its knees.
The United States is reluctant to adopt the declaration until Pyongyang has taken significant steps to promote disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want another summit.
But the view that Pyongyang is willing to give up its arsenal, which it likely sees as the only real way to ensure its own security, has aroused widespread suspicion.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the next Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris Fashion Show is showing off the latest collection of oversized headwear that will soon be on your street.
If you want to expand your hat collection or cover the sun completely, you don't have to keep looking.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled their SS19 line of special oversized headwear that dazzled the fashion circles of Paris Fashion Week.
Highly impractical headwear has taken over Instagram this summer, and these designers have also posted their amazing creations at fashion shows.
Valentino's most striking creation was a beige hat with a wide feathered cap that covered the models' heads almost completely.
Other oversized accessories included a watermelon with jewels, a wizard's hat, and even a pineapple but these are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a selection of odd masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips that resembled Hannibal Lecter more than high fashion.
One creature, with a snorkel and a mask, looked more like a scuba diver, and the other resembled a melted ice cream cone.
And if you want to take a stand on the issue of oversized fashion, you're in luck.
Fashionistas predict that giant scarves will be appearing in the street scene.
The oversized hats closely follow La Bombaa, the six-foot-long straw hat with a limer, which has been seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult image of the impractical hat, which has been widely shared on social media, has also fueled another large creation for fashion shows  a straw-made beach bag nearly as big as the model wearing it.
A raffia box with white leather handcuffs, bordered by a burnt orange ribbon, was the most prominent creation of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I think I'm going to see oversized hats and beach bags in the next summer. The designers have made such an impression that it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are a key skill for a global citizen.
The success of private schools in Scotland has traditionally been good, and this success has continued in 2018 as a result of good test results, fuelled by individual and community success in sport, the arts, music and other community projects.
These schools, which have over 30 000 pupils across Scotland and are represented by the Scottish Council for Private Schools (SCIS), strive to provide a high standard of service to their pupils and their parents.
Private schools strive to prepare their students for careers of their choice, for higher education, and for world citizenship.
As an educational operator able to design and implement tailored learning content, we have seen the status of languages as a preferred and desired continuing learning subject in educational institutions.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a person in a language they understand, the message goes to their head.
If you speak to a person in his own language, the message goes to his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone to build relationships of trust with people in other countries.
The latest test results for this year show that languages are at the top of the list for pass rates among private schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved the highest grade of A.
Data were collected from 74 SCIS schools and found that of the students who received the highest A grades, 72% studied Mandarin Chinese, 72% studied German, 69% studied French and 63% studied Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support the learning of foreign languages as an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are currently optional subjects, but are given the same status as science subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of private schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment Agency found that 17% of the situations in which an employer had difficulty finding a suitable employee for a job were explained by a lack of language skills.
The development of language skills is therefore all the more necessary to promote the career development of young people in the future.
The more the job prospects require language skills, the more relevant these skills become in a globalised world.
If a person has learned a second language, he will have an advantage in the future in this lifelong skill, regardless of the career he has chosen.
The ability to communicate directly with a foreigner automatically puts a language-savvy person ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in Britain, 75 percent cannot converse in a foreign language, and French was the only language that 15 percent could speak.
This is why investing in language learning is important for today's children.
Knowledge of languages, especially those of developing countries, gives children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
Within Scotland, schools differ in the languages they teach.
Many schools focus on traditional languages, while some specifically teach languages that are expected to be important for Britons in 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interests, private schools always have several language options taught by specialized teachers.
Private schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may bring.
In this era, it cannot be denied that in the international business environment, languages will continue to be of great importance for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be seen as international communication skills.
Private schools will continue to provide this freedom of choice, diversity and high standards for young people in Scotland.
I must do well.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council for Private Schools, SCIS.
LeBron is making his debut Sunday in San Diego .
The wait for fans to see LeBron James make his debut with the Los Angeles Lakers is about to end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday in a preseason game.
But how many minutes he actually plays remains to be seen.
"It's going to be more than one, and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play the missing minutes.
James, who has been following the practice, was asked earlier this week about his plans for the Lakers' six preseason games.
"At this point in my career, I don't need any more pre-matches to prepare", he said.
Trump's campaign time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will begin a series of campaigns today in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five Trump events scheduled for next week, including sympathetic targets like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote pending his selection to fill the vacant Supreme Court seat, Trump is seeking to build support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing their majority in Congress in the November election.
What time is Trump's West Virginia campaign today and how do you see it online?
Trump's event in Wheeling, West Virginia will begin at 7pm eastern time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia campaign event online as a live stream on YouTube by clicking below.
Trump will take the floor this week to hear from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has become hotly contested over sexual harassment allegations that have delayed a Senate confirmation vote for a week as the FBI investigates the allegations.
But the primary goal of the campaign is to support the Republican candidates in their successful bid for the November election.
Thus, the president's campaign commented that the purpose of these next five week events is to "awaken willing and supportive Republicans to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House", according to Reuters.
"Controlling Congress is so central to his purposes that the president is willing to travel to as many states as possible during a busy campaign period", a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Today's event will be held at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, and will draw fans from as far away as Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media from Pittsburgh, according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is Trump's second visit to West Virginia this month, a state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is backing Republican candidate for West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrissey, who has fallen behind in the polls.
"For Mr. Morrissey, it's not a good sign that the president is trying to build up his support in the polls", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows will to fight to keep hope alive ahead of Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's four-game series was just what this Ryder Cup needed.
Although the self-reinforcing power of success is a completely invented phenomenon in sports, players still believe in it, and even more so in tournaments like this.
Where do they think this power of success is right now?
'They had a six-point lead, which has been reduced to four, so we take this momentum as a leap forward', said Jordan Spieth as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage: four points ahead and 12 to play.
The Americans, as Spieth said, feel they have a little bit of wind in their sails and a lot to cheer for, like the fitness of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and got three points out of four.
Spieth has been outnumbered from brick to green, and he's leading by example.
The thunderous throat-cheers of the victory party intensified as his round progressed as he managed a critical putt to tie the game at four, with him and Thomas two points behind by two holes.
The putt they used to win Game 15 was followed by a similar shout that gave the impression that he believed that the United States team had not yet lost.
"You have to focus really hard and just focus on your own game", Spieth said.
It's the only thing these players have left now.
18 holes to make an impact.
The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are undisputed Ryder Cup legends Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe's quirky but sweet duo has won four of four straight.
Moliwood was the only duo to not make a single bog on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogs on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the final nine holes on Friday morning.
That round, and the way they give and take energy from this rowdy crowd, confirms that they are the pre-race favorites on Sunday, and when the sun sets at Le Golf National, there could be no more popular players to ensure Europe's eventual victory than Fleetwood and Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
It is premature to talk about Europe's success.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcia, who was paired with Alex Noren, the hero of the morning's four-game series.
One bogie and two double bogie on the first nine holes drilled the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole so deep they were nowhere near making it out.
Although, on Sunday, no one's gonna come to help you out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome are fascinating to watch closely from the perspective of partnership: what advice they give or don't give and how strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a considerable lead before the last day, but this four-game series showed that the United States team has the will to fight, although it is suspected, especially in the United States.
Europe takes a 10-6 lead before the final day of the Ryder Cup .
Europe is in a strong lead before the final day of the Ryder Cup after taking a 10-6 lead over the United States in the fours and fours on Saturday.
The brilliant duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the winning run by two points over the blinking Tiger Woods, and took the lead to four points today at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, who had struggled to retain their victory two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated the poorly-performing USA team in the morning fours, taking the match to 3-1.
The United States were the stronger opponent in four games, winning two, but they were unable to narrow their lead.
Jim Fury's side needed eight points from 12 doubles games on Sunday to retain the victory.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four consecutive points, and he and Molinari, also known collectively as Molliwood, became the second pair in Ryder Cup history to win four points in their first four games after a sensational weekend.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball first, they then finished even more aggressively, 5-4 to the overwhelmingly discouraged Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau.
Woods, who barely made it through Saturday's two games, was at times very brilliant, but he has lost 19 of his 29 games in the fours and fours, and even seven in a row.
Justin Rose rested his morning fours, but returned with Henrik Stenson for a foursome, but lost 2-1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are first and third in the standings.
Europe did not get everything it wanted on this fresh and pleasant day from Paris to the southwest.
Three-time defending champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a high goal for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They took a bold 2-1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fours, and later a 4-3 victory over Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the fours, however, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team moved up from a four-point lead to a tie in the opening game of a doubleheader, even though Fury's side also drew enough to keep the victory.
Although, after two days of being second best, it may be too much to ask for a Sunday counterattack.
North Korea will not under any circumstances disarm itself without trust.
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that continued sanctions only increased mistrust of the United States and that under the circumstances there was no possibility of North Korea unilaterally giving up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that over the past year, North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures", such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site and pledging not to increase its stockpile of nuclear weapons or technology.
'However, we have not seen a similar gesture from the United States,' he said.
Without trust in the United States, we cannot be sure of maintaining national security, so in these circumstances, unilateral disarmament is not possible.
While Mr Ri reiterated the familiar complaint that Washington does not accept a phased denuclearisation, with North Korea being rewarded for every step, his statement is significant in that unilateral denuclearisation was not completely ruled out, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first US-North Korean summit in Singapore on 12 June, in which Kim promised to "denuclearize the Korean peninsula" and Trump promised to ensure North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has demanded that Pyongyang first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed the easing of severe international sanctions on North Korea.
The US demands that nuclear disarmament be first and has increased pressure through sanctions to achieve its goals by force even in opposition to the Peace Declaration, Ri said.
The idea that sanctions will bring us to our knees is the wish of the indifferent.
But the problem is that continued sanctions only deepen our mistrust.
Ri did not mention plans to hold the next Kim-Trump summit, though Trump himself emphasized this to the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, adding: If the disarmament party had been South Korea and not the United States, the situation would not have reached this impasse.
Yet Rin's tone was markedly different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that the targeting of the US mainland with missiles was inevitable after "bad President" Trump called Kim a "suicide bomber".
Last year, Trump threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, but this year, Trump has praised Kim for his courageous approach to denuclearisation, but he has stressed that much work remains to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea gives up its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump mentioned that he has no time limit: "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia have suggested that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the progress it has already made.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that The strengthening of Security Council sanctions must continue strongly and without failure until we prove a complete, final and affirmative renunciation of nuclear weapons.
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to stem Pyongyang's funding channels for the production of ballistic and nuclear missiles.
Mr Pompeo met with North Korean leader Rin during the UN General Assembly and announced that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the most recent visit did not go smoothly.
He described progress as he left Pyongyang, but North Korea condemned Pompeo's "gangster demands" just hours later.
North Korea committed to closing its missile base and nuclear facility in a meeting with Secretary-General Moon earlier this month in the event of the US taking "corresponding measures".
Mr Pompeo said Kim was referring to the "corresponding measures" of security guarantees promised by Trump at the Singapore meeting and the move towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on getting enough rest .
All undergraduate students at Harvard University will participate this year in a course designed to increase student rest, a counter-culture to the university's burgeoning macho culture, where students sleep late on caffeine.
According to one researcher, students at the world's best university are often quite ignorant about the basic issues of their own well-being.
The course's designer, Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep research at Brigham and Women's Hospital at Harvard Medical School, believes it is the first of its kind in the United States.
Czeisler got the idea for the course after a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
After the lecture, a young woman came to me and said, "Why am I only learning about this now, in my last year of college?"
No one had ever told her about the need for sleep, which I found surprising, she told the Telegraph.
This year's course, the first of its kind, will guide students on how proper sleep habits support academic and athletic performance and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor at Harvard Medical School and vice president of health services, says that the university decided to organize the course after hearing about students suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the school week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
One section shows students a picture of a dorm room where they can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports equipment and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, and the impact of sleep deprivation on sports performance and the importance of regular evening activities.
In the second part, participants are told how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The campus map, with interactive images, encourages participants to reflect on their daily routines.
We know that this does not have an immediate impact on students' behaviour.
However, we believe they have a right to know about these matters, just as they have a right to know about the health effects of smoking, adds Professor Czeisler.
All-night study marathons are still a point of pride, says Professor Czeisler, and modern technology and ever-increasing student pressures have made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
Getting enough quality sleep should be the secret weapon of students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, and even weight gain, because lack of sleep creates a starvation-like state in the brain, causing a person to be constantly hungry, the professor points out.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student in chemical and physical psychology in California, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his courses during his first year at Harvard last year.
He says that the course opened his eyes and gave him the impetus to organize a course that would include all students on campus.
He hopes that all postgraduate students will be able to complete a similar course of study before moving to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends setting an alarm clock to remind students of bedtime in addition to waking up in the morning and to keep in mind the negative effects of electronic displays and LED lighting on circadian rhythms, which can make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers , Menga 's shot took the win from Gerrard 's players .
Steven Gerrard and the Rangers experienced another losing day as Dolly Menga's shot through a broken defense gave Livingston a 1-0 lead.
The Ibrox players were looking for their first win since a 41 game against St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's side won this time and Gerrard suffered just his second defeat in his 18-game managerial career, with Rangers eight points clear of current Premier League leader Hearts.
Menga hit the ball into the goal seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers' declining fighting spirit did not even the score.
Rangers are down to sixth place in the standings, but Livingston has moved up to third, behind only Hibernian in the points standings.
The Rangers may have other problems ahead of the game, as Calum Spence was injured in the head by an object thrown from the stands and has had to be treated.
Gerrard made eight substitute appearances in the team that beat Ayr and reached the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
Holt, who was also in the Livi XI squad that took a point from Hearts last week, again delivered on the same strategy, with a well-built squad able to punish the opposition at almost every turn.
Although the Rangers managed to dominate the ball possession, Livingston was better at using the situation to his advantage.
Livingston had a chance to score two minutes into the first pitch when Mengan gave Scott Pittman a clear shot to Allan McGregor, but Pittman failed to make the most of the opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs then directed his free kick to Craig Halkett, but another defender Alan Lithgow only managed to shoot wide into the back post.
The Rangers, on the other hand, took control of the game, but in the final third of the game, the air was no longer confident.
Alfredo Morelos demanded a penalty after he and Steven Lawless collided at the fifteenth minute mark, but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's requests.
Rangers managed to score just two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily deflected Lassana Coulibaly's shot and Ovie Ejari's weak shot.
Livingston's goal in the 34th minute was an unexpected opening, but it was not just the team's hard work that made it so.
The Rangers still couldn't do anything about Jacobs' long throwing tactics.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher pitched to Scott Robinson, who passed the ball coldly to Mengo for an easy field goal.
In the substitution, Gerrard decided to replace Coulibaly and put Ryan Kent on the field, a move that affected the game almost immediately as Kent opened a convenient hole for Morelos, but the attack interrupted Kelly's quick defensive action.
Livingston put the visitors back in their own game as Lithgow and Halkett continued to pitch long shots one after the other.
Holt's team had a chance to increase their lead in the final seconds of the game, but McGregor's brilliant defense stopped Jacobs's efforts before Lithgow could get to his position in the corner.
Rangers' alternate Glenn Middleton also demanded a penalty kick after facing Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: inventor of the Geiger counter
Next page of our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger, the future physicist, was born in Germany 136 years ago today.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which later led to the invention of the Geiger counter.
The method became one of the pillars of science and a key concept in pop culture, as exemplified by the 1950 film The Clocks of Coronado, in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans play scientists who look like shepherds:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: It's a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put your headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of radioactive radiation on minerals.
Evans: "Look, it's really raining now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer drug can teach the immune system to "see" and "destroy" malignant cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment.
The procedure involves isolating resistant cells from the patient and modifying them in the laboratory
After treatment, the cells injected back into the body are able to see proteins typical of many cancers
The trial has shown promising results in patients with various cancers.
For example, a patient with ovarian cancer lost cancer cells within 18 months of receiving a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
In this procedure, resistant cells are isolated from the patient and modified in the laboratory to be able to see the HER2 proteins typical of many cancers.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, U.S.A., describes the method: "Based on our results, this is a very promising vaccine".
HER2 "directs the growth of several cancers", explains Professor Berzofsky. "These include breast cancer and cancers of the ovaries, lungs and colon".
A similar approach  to take resistant cells from a patient and train them to attack cancer cells  has also been shown to be effective in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West was the target of a lot of criticism for praising Trump on Saturday Night Live with a campaign hat on.
The show didn 't go as planned .
Kanye West got a bang on his neck on Saturday Night Live for his racy praise of President Donald Trump and announcement that he was running for president in the 2020 election.
After performing his third song of the night, "Ghost Town", dressed in Trump's "Make America Great Again" campaign hat, West attacked the Democrats and reiterated his support for President Trump.
"Even when I talk to a white person, they ask me how I can support Trump because he's a racist.
If racism were a problem, I would have moved from America a long time ago, he says.
Tonight's broadcast began with a sketch in which Matt Damon mocks the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing of Brett Kavanaugh, which is related to Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual harassment by Kavanaugh.
West's fast was not broadcast live, but comedian Chris Rock posted a clip of it on social media.
It's unclear if Rock's intent is to mock West with his post.
West also complained to the audience that he had been mistreated backstage because of the hat he wore.
I was being bullied behind the scenes.
I was told not to go on stage with this hat on my head.
I've been teased!
Then they'll say I'm on the fringes", West says in an interview with the Washington Examiner.
West continues: "Do you want to see what it means to be on the fringes?" and says he's wearing a Superman cape because "then you can't tell me what to do.
Try it with love.
According to Variety, West's comments caused the audience to boo at least twice, and the show's performers looked embarrassed.
West was cast on the show on short notice to replace Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West caused confusion in many viewers by performing the song "I Love It" dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West is backed by the head of conservative TPUSA, Candace Turner, who praised his courage on Twitter:
However, talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just being herself, which is just wonderful.
I can however decide to SUPPORT a person (by buying his music or clothing brand or by supporting his art) whom I believe supports and promotes an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free man.
The same applies to us', he added.
The rapper announced on Twitter before his performance tonight that he had changed his name to personas, formerly known as Kanye West.
West is not the first artist to change his name, but the musician is following Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, was also known as Snoop Lion, and of course we also remember the late music legend Prince, who changed his name to the symbol and then the artist who used to be known as Prince.
Belfast restaurant stabbing suspect charged with attempted murder
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
Police say the incident happened in the Ballyhackamore area.
The accused is due to appear in Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The prosecution will be reviewing the charge.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington is attacking a toxic masculinity .
Kit Harington is best known for his sword-wielding heroic role as Jon Snow in the HBO violent fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, Harrington has attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles give young boys a sense that respect must be earned with toughness.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture Supplement, Harrington suspects that "something has gone wrong" and questions the current approach to tackling toxic masculinity in the age of #MeToo.
Recently married to Rose Leslie, 31, also of the same age as the Star Guard in Game of Thrones, Harrington admits that he has a strong desire to get involved.
The question of where we have gone wrong with masculinity is causing me strong feelings right now, he says.
What have men been taught over the years of their upbringing that has led to the problems we see today?
Harrington believes that television and its highly masculine characters are partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity.
He goes on: "What is innate and what is learned?
What is being taught on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel that they have to be certain things to be men?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time: how can we change this?
Because there is something very, very wrong with young men.
In the interview, he also admits that he would not be involved in the production of any Game of Thrones prequel or sequel after the series ends next summer, because he has, in his words, "gotten tired of the battlefields and the horses".
In November, Harrington will be seen in a new version of Sam Shepard's play True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his robber brother.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his future wife Rose was the best thing Game of Thrones has ever offered him.
"I met my wife on this show, so in a way it gave me my future family and my life from then on", he says.
Rose Leslie played Ygritte, the love interest of Jon Snow, played by Harrington, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: New infections have increased by 14% in China
China has reported a 14 percent increase in the number of its HIV-positive and AIDS-infected citizens.
Health officials say the virus is affecting more than 820,000 people in the country.
Around 40 000 new cases have been reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases are transmitted through sex, which is a change from previous statistics.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China through contaminated blood transfusions.
However, according to Chinese health officials who spoke at a conference in Yunnan Province, HIV infections have been reduced to almost zero in this way.
Yet, a year later, the number of new HIV and AIDS cases in China has risen by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is a major issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has been reported to be widespread.
Studies have estimated that due to the country's conservative values, 70 to 90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many infections are the result of inadequate protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to ensure that HIV medicines are available to all as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee leaked information to a Republican senator and accuses her of spreading "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denied claims that her staff had published personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
A Democrat from Los Angeles assured that the claims were being spread by far-right commentators and websites.
"Lies, lies and more despicable lies", Waters said in a statement posted on Twitter.
Among the information released were the home addresses and telephone numbers of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham and Utah State Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch.
An unidentified person released the information Thursday from the U.S. Congress during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred shortly after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState report that Hill's newspaper said the messages were posted from an IP address connected to Waters' office and by a member of Waters' staff.
This baseless accusation is completely false and an absolute lie, Water continued.
My employee, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations, is in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This baseless accusation is completely false and utterly false.
Waters' statement was quickly met with criticism online, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
The way he denies this is very hostile, wrote Fleischer.
It seems that his character is not suitable for a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, he has no reason to act in a hostile way.
There's no need to be defiant.
There's no reason to question the prosecutor's motives.
In this situation, you should behave with moderation and calmness.
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters's reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of excessive hostility during Thursday's hearing.
Republican nominee Omar Navarro, who is running for Waters' seat in the midterm congressional elections, has also expressed his views on Twitter.
"It's unbelievable if this is true", he tweeted.
Waters said in a statement that he had contacted the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies regarding these fraudulent allegations.
We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed, he continued, and that they are held legally accountable for any destructive and dangerous actions against any or all of my staff.
Johnny English strikes again with a sub-par Rowan Atkinson agent parody .
It is an established tradition to look for Brexit references in any little movie about Britain, but this does not seem to fit the Johnny English agent parody and action comedy series that began in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived in 2011 with the sequel Johnny English Reborn.
Can a tongue-in-cheek satire of the nation become Britain's next national export success?
Either way, the squinting, rubber-faced, incompetent Johnny English has earned his license to screw up again, and his name alone says more than anything else that he is a comic creation, aimed at the non-English-speaking world of cinema.
It's of course about that silly secret agent who's desperate to breathe the glamorous glow of the melting pot, but then shows up as a mix of Inspector Clouseau, Mr. Bean and that unfortunate one-note musician at the 2012 London opening.
The character is based on the cosmopolitan and mystical man of the world who left behind a chaos that Atkinson originally portrayed in the now-forgotten TV ads for Barclaycard.
The last show will have its moment.
I especially liked the scene where Johnny English arrives in a helicopter wearing medieval armor and the rotor blades crash into his helmet.
Atkinson's physical comedy talents come to the fore, but the humor itself seems under-performing and oddly unnecessary, especially since "serious" film brands like 007 and Danger Mission now offer humor as part of the core content of the film.
The humor seems to be aimed at children, and Johnny English's treatment of the lunatic doesn't strike me as resourceful and sharp-sighted as Atkinson's silent comedy Mr. Bean.
The starting point, which is repeated every year, is that Britain is once again in worse trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain's top-secret spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents operating in the field to the dismay of the agent in charge  in what is presented as a pitifully small performance by Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the important and weary Prime Minister, already up to his ears in the middle of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything in the shoes of the Teresa May parody character, but the script just doesn't give her enough room.
When intelligence advisers inform him that all spies in the field have been exposed, he must call in someone who has already retired from active service.
This is, of course, the ass-kissing Johnny English in his own person, who spends his retirement days teaching at a high school, but also gives informal lessons in the noble art of espionage, and the subject matter is some clever jokes; English keeps School of Rock-type lessons to the secrets of intelligence.
English is rushed to an emergency meeting at Whitehall, where he is reunited with his endlessly patient fighting partner Bough, still played by Ben Miller.
Bough is already a family man, married to a submarine commander whose role Vicki Pepperdine doesn't seem to be getting her due.
So the disastrous Batman and Robin have returned to Her Majesty's secret service to face off against the fatal supervillain Ophelia Bhuletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is being manipulated by a charismatic IT billionaire, played by Jake Lackey, Jason Volta, who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems.
English and Bough's odyssey quickly turns into a farce: a pair of waitresses set fire to a fine French restaurant and cause chaos as they secretly seek out Volta's luxury, but their attempt to get inside Volta's house with virtual glasses ends in pure anarchy in the real world.
The final obstacles of the filmmakers are overcome by the final scene, but despite all the powerlessness and glamour, the film still feels a little made for a children's audience.
I think it's a moderate movie.
I've seen Johnny English movies before and I've come to the same conclusion: why can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to her talent?
The British Labour Party rejects plans for a four-day workweek with five-day wages
Labour, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is considering a radical plan to make Britain work four days a week but be paid for five.
The party is reported to be demanding that business leaders pass on the savings of the AI revolution to workers in the form of an extra day off.
The plan would allow workers to enjoy three days off at the same wage.
Sources say the idea "could be in line" with the party's economic programme and its plans to shift policy in favour of workers.
The Central Trade Union Confederation supports the move to a four-day workweek as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economic situation.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: "The revision of the budget was announced before the turn of the year.
Change will not happen overnight, but the four-day workweek is a goal that fits with the party's approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of workers and the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first to support the idea: the Green Party in Britain committed to supporting a four-day workweek during its 2017 referendum campaign.
But the aim will not be given uncompromising support in the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day workweek is not the party line and the party is not considering such a move".
The Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, John McDonnell, used a working conference last week to present his vision for an economic revolution.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "growthless dictators" and "community-interest corporations".
The shadow government's plans for the Minister for Finance are that the current shareholders of water companies will not be able to recover their shares in full because the Labour government could implement reductions based on the abuses detected.
He also confirmed plans to appoint employees to company boards and to create inclusive ownership funds to transfer 10% of the share capital of private sector companies to employee management, with a maximum annual dividend of £500 per employee.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy discuss on 60 Minutes whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh might change their minds.
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on Kavanaugh's nomination for the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising questions as to whether the outcome of the investigation could shake some Republican senators' support for Kavanaugh's nomination.
On Sunday's episode of 60 Minutes, correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI might be able to find out something that might change their minds.
Kennedy was more forthright than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Of course", said Kennedy.
"I told you on my way to the hearing... "I told you I had a conversation with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, when the charges came up, and I said to him, 'Do you see that?'
He was determined, determined, unambiguous.
Graham's voice, on the other hand, looks like it's been hit by a rock.
"I've made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it's a bombshell", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett vehemently denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
None of the people he named could confirm it.
This is a 36-year-old matter.
I don't see what could change that.
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival, to be held in New York City on Saturday, is a music event whose lineup is as impressive as its mission: to end poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival draws tens of thousands of people to the lawns of New York's Central Park to hear from performers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to spread awareness about the event's real goal: to end extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is a continuation of the Global Powerty Project, an international advisory group that aims to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively working to eradicate poverty.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you are not willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the public must perform various tasks or acts, such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a political decision-maker or making a phone call, or performing some other activity that spreads awareness of the project's objectives.
But how has Global Citizen succeeded now that we are only 12 years away from achieving the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concert tickets a real way to get people to take action, or is it just another clicktivism among others  fantasy that you can change the world by signing an email address or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen reports that it has recorded over 19 million campaigns for different causes since 2011.
It says these actions have encouraged policymakers to announce commitments and principles worth more than $37 billion, which have been spent in ways that will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
The Group listed 390 commitments and declarations, on the basis of which more than USD 10 billion have already been spent or raised, at the beginning of 2018.
The group estimates that the resources made have already affected the lives of nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based group of investors and entrepreneurs committed to "helping children develop to their full potential". The group pledged $35 million to Rwanda to end malnutrition in the country, after activists sent them 4,700 tweets as a result of a Global Citizen campaign.
Thanks to the UK government, donors, governments in different countries and global citizens just like you, we can put social injustice and malnutrition on the history books, Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the audience at a concert in London in 2018.
The group also called on the UK government to take action to improve maternal and child nutrition through more than 5 000 actions.The government has announced funding for the Power on Nutrition project, which focuses on fighting malnutrition and reaches 5 million mothers and children.
One of the questions in the FAQ section of the movement's website is: Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?
Global Citizen's response: The road ahead is long and difficult, with many stumbling blocks.
But we will succeed, as did the great civil rights struggles and anti-apartheid movements before us, because together we are stronger.
Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman are hosting the movement's New York concert this year, and its star-studded lineup includes artists like Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe.
The US Department of the Interior has warned that the country may hinder energy exports by using the Navy as a "barrier".
According to Ryan Zink, the US Secretary of the Interior, quoted in the Washington Examiner, Washington can "if necessary" rely on the help of its navy to prevent the spread of Russian energy in world markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke claims that Russia's activities in Syria  at the invitation of the legitimate government  are a pretext for the excitement of new energy markets in the region.
I believe that the reason for [Russia's] presence in the Middle East is to provide energy, just as in Eastern Europe, in the southern hemisphere of Europe, Zinken is reported to have said.
The Authority believes that there are ways and means to prevent this.
'The US has the ability to keep shipping lanes open with its fleet and, if necessary, blockade to ensure that the energy they supply does not end up on the world market,' he says.
Zinke spoke to the audience at an event organised by the Energy Consumers Association, a non-profit group that profiles itself as the "voice of energy consumers" in the US.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that they are one and the same.
The economic alternative between Iran and Russia is more or less speculation, and the substitution of one fuel for another, he says, describing Russia as a one-trick circus number whose economy is based on fossil fuels.
The comments come at a time when the Trump administration has sought to boost exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe and replace it with considerably cheaper Russian liquefied natural gas.
To make this more effective, the Trump administration, including President Trump, is trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which President Trump says will link Berlin to the Moscow pipeline.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which aims to double the capacity of the existing 110 billion cubic metres pipeline, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's opposition is purely economic and that it is an example of unhealthy competition.
I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a leverage and that consumers should have the choice of its supplier says Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after meeting US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US attitude has provoked a backlash in Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The country's leading industry umbrella organisation, the Central Confederation of German Industry, has urged the United States to stay out of EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
I find it very problematic that a third country is interfering in our energy supply, said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Confederation of Industry, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator from Massachusetts, is considering carefully whether to run for President in 2020.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts announced Saturday that she was "carefully considering" running for president after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed that he would consider running in an open polling event in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It is time for women to move to Washington and fix our flawed administration, and that means a woman in the leadership of the kingdom", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I will consider carefully my candidacy for president.
Warren criticized President Donald Trump during the event, saying that he was "leading the country in the wrong direction".
"I'm worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he says.
Warren has been outspoken in his criticism of Trump and this Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren wrote, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote".
However, a poll released Thursday found that a majority of Warren's constituents do not support his bid for the 2020 election.
A survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Institute and the Boston Globe found that 58% of "likely" voters in Massachusetts would not support a senator running.
32% of the people in the country voted to run.
A majority of respondents supported former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy with 38%, while 48% opposed the idea.
Other prominent Democratic candidates in the 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden has said he will officially announce his candidacy by January.
Sarah Palin refers to her son's war trauma at Donald Trump's campaign.
Sarah Palin's son Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the military in September.
Track Palin was arrested Monday night and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through when he comes home, I can very well relate to other families who are facing the effects of PTSD and the injuries that our returning soldiers carry", she told an audience at the election of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "a watershed moment in the living room" and said his son, like other war veterans, "will come home a little changed, they will come home hardened, they will come home wondering if what he and his comrades in the army and air force have done for this country is respected".
Track Palin was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, according to Wasilla Police spokesman Dan Bennett, charged with domestic violence and assaulting a woman, domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the new asylum lawsuit
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are seeking to change a new policy that has been implemented in the United States to deny asylum to people fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia have left a Friends of the Law letter in Washington on Friday supporting asylum seekers who violate the policy, NBC News reports.
The plaintiff's full name has not been released in the so-called Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy.
He says he was abused by his partner and his sons, who were members of a violent gang, and was denied asylum by the US authorities on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutor general who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, the home countries of many of the asylum seekers in the United States, as countries where gang and domestic violence are a widespread problem at all levels of society.
The new US asylum policy overturns a 2014 decision by the Asylum Appeal Board that undocumented migrants have been able to seek asylum on the basis of domestic violence.
Federal District Attorney General Karl Racine commented in a statement Friday that the new line "disregards decades of state, federal and international law".
Federal law requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application and such an obstacle violates this principle, says the Friends of the Right letter.
The letter also alleges that the practice of blocking asylum seekers from entering the United States is damaging to the economy because immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs and bring in the additional workforce they need.
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to suspend granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
Asylum is for people fleeing their home country because of persecution or fear of persecution due to their race, religion, nationality or political opinion Sessions announced the new asylum practice in a statement on 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems  even the serious problems  that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue efforts continue in Palus  The number of dead found has already doubled
For the survivors, the situation will become more serious.
The situation is very tense, says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her fever-stricken baby at an evacuation centre in the ruined city of Palun.
Ambulance is bringing in more bodies every minute.
Clean water is scarce.
Residents return to their destroyed homes, retrieve their sunken belongings and try to save what remains to be saved.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals are full of people affected by the 7.5 magnitude quake.
Some of the injured, such as Dwi Haris, who suffered a fractured spine and shoulder, are resting outside the Palun Army Hospital, where patients are being treated for continuous, powerful aftershocks.
Tears fill his eyes as he recounts how a violent earthquake shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was squeezed between the walls, I think. Harris told the Associated Press that he and his family were in town for their wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help and then it got quiet.
I don't know what happened to her or my baby.
I hope they're safe.
The US ambassador accuses China of "provocation" "propaganda ads"
The US-China ambassador accuses Beijing of using the American newspaper as a propaganda tool, a week after the Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a US daily praising the mutual benefits of the US-China trade deal.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to a paid supplement to the China Daily in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's largest newspaper by circulation, after accusing China of interfering in the November 6 congressional elections.
Trump's accusations of Beijing's attempts to interfere in the US election mark a new phase in Washington's expanding campaign to pressure China, US officials told Reuters.
While it is normal for a foreign government to issue trade promotion notices, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an ever-escalating trade war, with both sides in turn imposing tariffs on each other's exports.
Chinese and American experts say China's retaliatory tariffs were aimed at states like Iowa that backed Trump's Republican Party at the start of the trade war.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and longtime governor of Iowa, says Beijing has done damage to American workers, farmers and businesses.
China is now intensifying its provocations by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press", Branstad wrote in an opinion piece published in the Des Moines Register on Sunday.
In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the United States' cherished traditions of free speech and press by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register, Branstad writes.
In contrast, the opinion splits on the Beijing street newsstands are limited, and the real, disagreements that Chinese citizens may have about the alarming development of their economy are not seen at all, because the media are strictly under the purview of the Chinese Communist Party, he writes.
Branstad goes on to say that one of China's largest newspapers declined an offer to publish his article, but he does not specify which newspaper.
The Kavanaugh fiasco will drive women voters away from the Republican Party, analysts warn.
The fact that many of the top Republicans are standing behind and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh could spark a backlash, analysts say, especially among women voters in the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiment surrounding the case has been high, and most Republicans have already indicated they want to move forward with the vote.
"These things cannot be undone", says Grant Reeher, professor of government at the Maxwell Institute at Syracuse University, in an article published Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher doesn't believe Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute offer to investigate the FBI will appease angry voters.
Women do not forget what happened yesterday and they will not forget tomorrow or in November, says Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and spokesperson for the national reform group MoveOn, according to a newspaper published in the capital on Friday.
Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming" as they marched through the Senate aisles to protest the decision by the Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee to advance Kavanaugh's nomination, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reports.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will no longer be measurable, says Stu Rothenberg, a non-committal political analyst, in an interview with a news website.
People say that the enthusiasm has already been high, and it is true.
But it could be even higher, especially among insecure women voters in the suburbs and younger voters, aged 18-29 who often do not vote because they do not like the president.
Analysts expect a possible backlash if Republicans move forward with the confirmation before Ford testifies against the Supreme Court nominee who made the sexual harassment allegation.
"This is going to be a mess for the Republican Party", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier last week.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is going to be questioned, it's about how the Republicans have handled the issue and how they've handled Ford", Guy Cecil, the head of the Democratic-backed group Priorities USA, told the news channel.
Americans, however, seem somewhat divided as to whether to believe the testimony of Ford or Kavanaugh, with the narrow majority leaning toward the latter.
According to a new YouGov poll, 41% of respondents believe Ford's testimony absolutely or probably, while 35% say they absolutely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% say they think Kavanaugh is likely or definitely lying in his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
With Flake pushing the issue, the FBI is investigating Ford and at least one other allegation made by Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reports.
Ford testified before the Judiciary Committee under oath that Kavanaugh molested him while he was drunk when Ford was 17.
Ramirez claims that a Supreme Court nominee exposed her genitals to him at a student party while they were both students at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet as a counterattack to Google and Facebook .
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, has launched a startup company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the tech legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform Solid from Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to any data.
In an interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokes that Inrupt's purpose is "to rule the world".
It has to be done now, he said, referring to his startup.
This is a historic moment.
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own personal data warehouse, or POD.
It may include contact lists, notebooks, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all coming together in one browser at the same time.
The unique feature of a personal data repository is that it is entirely up to the user to decide which data types are accessed.
The company calls it personal empowerment through information.
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is to provide the resources, processes and skills required to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform purchased by IBM, some contracted developers working on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website, all available starting this week.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team are not discussing with Facebook and Google whether to offer people a complete change in which all their business models are turned upside down overnight.
We do not ask for their consent.
In an article published in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem for the integrity and quality of the new Solid built network".
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will retain his position as founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute after the launch of Inrupt.
I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the web Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: the town commemorates the heroic priest of the First World War
The city is celebrating the 100th anniversary of the death of the only Church of England priest to have been awarded the Victoria Cross.
The Medal of Valor was awarded to Lieutenant Colonel, Reverend Bernard Vann on 29 September 1918 for the attack on the villages of Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
Vann died, however, the sniper was created four days later without ever knowing he had received the highest honour in the British Army.
Two of his grandchildren were unveiling the memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire last Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, says the event is "emotionally symbolic"; the monument was unveiled exactly 100 years after the heroism of his award-winning grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin in a very dense fog and under heavy field and machine gun fire.
Later, he rushed to the front line and, "showing the greatest bravery", led the advance of the troops before storming the field guns alone.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann died of a German sniper was created on 4 October 1918  just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's deed was "something I could never match, something that inspires respect".
Michael Vann He and his brother Dr James Vann were cremated after a parade by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann says it is 'a great honour to be part of the parade' and adds: 'A great many people are commemorating the honour of a true hero.'
Fighters were up all night waiting for the Bellator 206 Tournament.
Imagine a situation where you've been up all night watching the highly anticipated Bellator 206 tournament and the whole event isn't even being shown.
The San Jose event was scheduled to feature 13 matches, including six first-round games, and was to be broadcast live in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Mouse and Rory MacDonald were getting ready for the ring, the program changed to Pippa Pig to the great shock of the audience.
Some of the spectators were not particularly happy after staying up all night for the match.
One freestyle fan opened up on Twitter, describing the substitution of a children's cartoon as "some kind of sick joke".
By law, the content was not suitable for 6am, so they had to switch to a children's programme explained Dave Schwartz, senior assistant manager of marketing and communications at Bellator.
- Pizza Pig, yeah. - I know.
Scott Coker, CEO of Bellator, said that the schedules will be worked out so that UK viewers can follow events in the future.
"I'm thinking of a rebroadcast, which will probably get the show going", Coker said.
However, it is six o'clock in the morning there and we cannot get the programme on until Sundays in our time, which is Monday in their time.
We're working on it.
And you can imagine that as the program changed in their heads, the messages started going back and forth, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix the bug because we thought it was a technical problem.
However, this was not the case. It was a legislative matter.
I can promise you, next time, this won't happen.
We're limiting the number of games to five instead of six as usual, and we tried to offer our fans more, and we tried too hard.
This is a sad situation.
Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality .
Swimmer and Olympic athlete Tom Daley says that he felt inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but that it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete says that it was not until he entered high school that he realized that not everyone is like me.
Speaking on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, Daley says he spoke about gay rights to give others "hope".
She also tells how after having a child, winning the Olympics was no longer so important.
The longtime host of the radio show Kristy Young has taken several months off due to illness.
In her first guest appearance on Laverne's show, Daley said that when she was young, she felt "less than everyone else" because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and work".
She says: "To this day, those feelings of being less and different have been a reality, and they have given me the strength and energy I need to succeed".
He says that he wanted to prove that he was "something" so that he would not disappoint everyone when his sexuality was finally revealed.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT activist, and she's appearing at this year's Commonwealth Games to advocate for the criminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he came out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give hope to other people.
The three-time world champion reveals her love for the man  American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013   came as a surprise.
Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years his senior last year, but says the age difference has never been an issue.
If you experience so many things at such a young age  she took part in her first Olympics at 14 and her father died of cancer three years later  it is hard to find another person her age who has experienced the same ups and downs, Daley says.
The couple had a son in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, who has changed his whole perspective.
"If you had asked me last year, my life would have been about winning the gold medal", she says.
You know, there are bigger things than an Olympic gold medal.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal.
Her son was named after Daly's father, who died in 2011 at just 40 years of age from brain cancer.
Daley said that his father never approved of him dying, and one of the last things he asked Daley was about tickets to the 2012 Olympics.
"I couldn't tell him he wasn't going to be around to be on the front lines anymore", Daley says.
"I held her hand when she stopped breathing, and it was only when she really stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized she was not invulnerable", she says.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew this was something I'd dreamed of all my life - jumping in front of my home crowd at the Olympics.
This was also the inspiration for her first song selection on the show  Heather Small's song Proud  which stirred emotions even as she was preparing for the Olympics, and which still gets her skin on the chicken.

Halfway to the bench for Mickelson in the Ryder Cup on Saturday .
Phil Mickelson of the United States will break the record on Sunday for his 47th Ryder Cup round, but he will have to fail significantly to avoid a record-breaking round going down in history as an unfortunate performance.
Mickelson, who is playing in the biennial event for a record 12th time, was moved to the bench by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourball and foursome.
The American, who was usually the center of attention, five-time Major champion now spent half the day cheering and half the day on the field trying to get his bat in check.
The 48-year-old Mickelson, who was not even considered one of the most accurate drivers at the peak of his career, is not an ideal choice for a tight Le Golf National course where a tall, rough-skinned man is punished for poorly executed shots.
If Mickelson's own field is not enough to compete with, Sunday's ninth game will see the British Open champion Francesco Molinari, known for his accuracy, play alongside rookie Tommy Fleetwood, who are aiming to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind in 12 double plays, get a flying start, Michelson's play could prove to be extremely important.
Furyk has expressed his confidence in his players, but what else can you say in the circumstances?
"He understands perfectly the role he played today.He patted me on the back, rubbed me and said he was ready for tomorrow", Furyk said.
He's got a lot of confidence.
He's one of the best players in the game, without question, and he's brought so much to his team in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
I had a different idea, but this is how it happened, and this is how we ended up.
He wants to be on that field as much as anyone.
Mickelson breaks Nick Faldon's record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It could also mean the end of a man's Ryder Cup career, which, though never comparable to his personal achievements, is now over.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, but Fury says his presence brings something indefinable to the team.
He is funny, sarcastic, clever, likes to joke at people's expense and he is a funny guy who everyone likes to be around, she explains.
I'm sure the younger players had fun with him this week too.
He brings so much more to the team than just his contribution to the game.
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows how quickly a long-standing lead can disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that the long lead in the Ryder Cup before the final day of doubles can be a bumpy ride.
The Danish player made his debut in 1997 at Valderrama, where the side led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but who emerged victorious on the lime lines just barely out of his nose and won by the narrowest possible margin141⁄2131⁄2.
"It reminds me of how we led the way in Valderrama, we led the way in Brooklyn where we lost, but we won in Valderrama, albeit narrowly", said Bjorn after watching the 2018 team's 53 wins both Friday and yesterday, moving to 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History will show me and all the other members of this team that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow we'll fire a large caliber.
We're gonna go out there and do everything right.
The game's not over until the numbers are on the board.
We have a goal, we're trying to win that prize, and we're just aiming for that.
As I have always said, I am focusing on these 12 players who are playing for us, but we are aware of what is on the other side: the best players in the world.
Pleased with the way his teammates have handled the difficult terrain, Bjorn adds: "I never give up before I fall down on these things.
Tomorrow is a whole different story.
Tomorrow, we'll focus on individual performance, and then we'll talk about different things.
It's great to be on the field with a partner when everything's going well, but when you're on the field alone, that's when your capacity is tested to the limit.
This is a message that must be conveyed to the players  tomorrow everyone will perform to the best of their ability.
Now you have to give up a partner who will let him go [on the field alone] and do his best.
Unlike Bjorn, opposing captain Jim Fury will expect his players to perform better individually than they could as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who collected three points out of four.
Furyk, on the other hand, has experienced the twists and turns of the final day, playing in the team that won in Brooklyn before ending up as the loser when the European team won in "Medina by miracle".
"I remember every word of that curse", he said in response to a question about how 1999 captain Ben Crenshaw led his team to the final day of the season.
We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to get off to a fast start just like we did in Brooklyn, or like we did in Medina.
When you get things moving in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We've adjusted our lineup accordingly and we're putting the boys on the field the way we want them to be, and as you know, we're going to do wonders tomorrow.
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the defense and he faces Rory McIlroy in the main event, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter next in line to face their European opponents.
I put the teammates in this order because I think it will carry through the whole tournament, Bjorn commented on his choices of doubles.
The new German warship is delayed again .
The newest frigate in the German Navy was due to enter service in 2014, replacing the outdated Cold War equipment, but will not be commissioned until next year due to faulty systems and skyrocketing costs, local media reported.
According to a military spokesperson, the commissioning of the first ship of the new Baden-Württemberg class frigate, Rheinland-Pfalz, has been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the fleet in 2014, but worrying post-delivery problems have plagued the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 are intended to replace the ageing Bremen-class frigates.
According to available information, they are equipped with effective guns, anti-aircraft and anti-surface missile systems and stealth technology, such as radar reflectivity and infrared and acoustic detection technology.
The ship's important features include its longer service interval  new frigates should be able to operate at sea for up to two years without having to make occasional home port calls.
However, the continuing delays mean that the state-of-the-art warships  purportedly designed to increase Germany's influence overseas  are already obsolete by the time they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship after it was delivered.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media have reported on significant "software and hardware flaws" that render the warship unfit for combat.
The software deficiencies are particularly important because the Baden-Württemberg class has a crew of around 120, which is only half the size of the older Bremen class frigates.
It was also found that the vessel is significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the possibilities for the fleet to make further upgrades.
The Rhineland-Palatinate, with a capacity of 7,000 tons, is believed to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the faulty equipment, the cost of the entire project is also a problem.
The price multiplied by the original price of EUR 2,2 billion has risen to a staggering EUR 3,1 billion.
The problems of getting new frigates into service have been brought to the fore in light of recent warnings that the German navy is shrinking.
The German parliament's defence committee chairman, Hans-Peter Bartels, noted earlier this year that the fleet's operational ships were running out.
The Authority claims that the problem has increased over time because old vessels have been decommissioned but not replaced.
He complained that no Baden-Württemberg class frigate had been able to enter service.
The Environmental Protection Agency is listening in on the hidden lives of bats
A new study in the Scottish Highlands aims to investigate how bats use the land to hunt for food.
The hope is that the new study will shed new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and provide guidance for future conservation measures.
A study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland is monitoring butterflies, moths, and water lilies in the Inverewe Gardens, a botanical garden in Wester Ross.
The study will place special recording devices at key points in the area to monitor the activity of bats during the season.
The organization's staff and volunteers also perform mobile measurements using portable observation equipment.
The frequency of the votes and the species at each time are determined by expert analysis.
The results will be used to produce a habitat map and report, which will present the behaviour of the bats in a scale-up image of the area.
Rob Dewar, the organization's conservation adviser, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important to bats and how different species benefit from them.
The data will be useful in habitat planning, such as the creation of grasslands and forest management, taking into account bats and related species.
In Scotland and throughout Britain, bat populations have declined dramatically over the past century.
Building and landscaping are threatening bat resting places and habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flypaper and certain chemicals used in building materials, and attacks by pet cats.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, their nocturnal hunting habits make their ears more useful for catching prey than their eyes.
Bats use sophisticated echo-location technology to detect insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The National Trust for Scotland is a charity dedicated to the protection of the rural environment, maintaining over 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country  and they take bats seriously.
It has 10 experts who carry out regular surveys, inspections of rest areas and, in some cases, rescue operations.
The organisation has even established Scotland's first and only bat sanctuary on the land of Threave Manor in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
According to farmer David Thompson, the area is ideal for bats.
Threave suits the bats very well, he says.
We have old buildings and trees and overall a good living environment.
Not everything is known about bats yet, so our work here and in other areas of the organization helps us to better understand what bats need to thrive.
He stresses the importance of checking buildings for bats before any renovation work is undertaken, as the accidental destruction of one bat resting place can result in the death of up to 400 female and young bats and the destruction of an entire local population.
Bat is a protected animal and killing, harassment or destruction of its resting place is prohibited.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official with the Bat Conservation Society, encourages the public to participate in conservation efforts.
He says: 'We still have a lot to learn from our bats and we don't yet know how their populations will fare.'
Ronaldo denies rape charges as lawyers prepare a lawsuit against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has branded the rape allegations against him "fake news" and says people want to "advertise themselves" using his name.
Ronaldo's lawyers have taken action to sue the allegations made by the German newspaper Der Spiegel.
The Portugal and Juventus forward has been charged with raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He allegedly paid his victim $375,000 to keep quiet, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Ronaldo appeared on Instagram live to his 142 million followers just hours after the allegations were made.The 33-year-old football player strongly denied the allegations, describing them as "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to do this.
What they've said today, fake news, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said to the camera.
They just want to advertise themselves using my name.
It's normal, you know?
They want to be famous for using my name. It's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine", the player continued with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over allegations they have called, according to Reuters, "inadequate reporting on privacy concerns".
Lawyer Christian Schertz says the player is seeking compensation for the "mental suffering" in proportion to the severity of the violation, which is probably the most serious violation of personal rights in recent years.
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
Ronaldo and Mayorgan allegedly met at a nightclub and moved into the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to court documents filed in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo got down on his knees after the alleged incident and told him he was 99 percent a good guy, but only 1 percent of which was disappointing.
According to the documents, Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that he visited the police station and took pictures of his injuries in the hospital, but later settled out of court because he was "terrified of the possibility of revenge" and "concerned about public humiliation".
The 34-year-old now says he's seeking a settlement because he's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to a deal to move to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged Manchester United heist, and he moved to Italian giants Juventus for a reported $100 million.
Brexit: Britain would regret for ever the end of car production
The UK would be 'regretful forever' if it lost its position as the world's leading carmaker after Brexit, said Trade Minister Greg Clark.
He added that he was 'concerned' by Toyota's UK unit's announcement that it would temporarily suspend production at its Burnaston plant near Derby if Britain left the EU without a deal.
"We need a deal", says Clark.
The Japanese carmaker says the impact of the border checks will be seen in job losses if Brexit ends without a deal.
The Burnaston plant  where Toyota Auris and Avensis are manufactured  produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
'My view is that if the UK abruptly leaves the EU at the end of March, production will be interrupted at our plant,' says Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota's Burnston unit.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concerns about how crossborder trade will work in the wake of the EU withdrawal.
BMW, for example, has announced that it will close its Mini plant for a month when Brexit takes place.
The main concern, according to carmakers, is the risks to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The Toyota production line is run on a timely JOT principle, with parts arriving at the plant every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU and cars being made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, it could cause disruption at the border, which the industry believes could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota claims that it is impossible to store more than 24 hours at the Derbyshire plant and that production would be halted.
Clark says Theresa May's EU relations plan is "carefully calibrated to avoid these border checks".
We need a deal.We want the best deal possible, which is not just a success in the current situation, but an opportunity we must seize, he says on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
 Not only Toyota's but also the statements of other manufacturers show that we must absolutely be able to continue the supply chains that have worked very well so far.
Toyota cannot say how long production would be halted, but warns that the additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually cause job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a trade union director at the factory, says there is growing concern among members: In my experience, jobs lost are never recovered.
A government spokesman says: We must present a clear and credible plan for our future relations with the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says.
Donald Trump's challenging meeting with Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "postponed for another week" due to a lawsuit surrounding Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the White House announced Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, the ties of Trump aides to Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
There have been rumours in Washington for months that Trump plans to fire the assistant attorney general, which would jeopardize the impartiality of the Mueller investigation.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of secretly recording conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of impeaching the president under the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein has denied any information in the report.
Rosenstein visited the White House last Monday, and the purpose of the meeting was reportedly to discuss Rosenstein's resignation.
However, President Trump was on a visit to the United Nations in New York at the time, so the date was announced as Thursday.
Trump said he "would rather not" fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed because it coincided with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, were both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was featured on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, Sanders said, "No date has been set for this.
We'll see, but I always like to keep the press updated.
Some journalists might disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
News anchor Chris Wallace asked why this happened.
Sanders says the reason for the lack of press conferences is not just a dislike of TV reporters' "attention seeking" but he said: "I don't deny the fact that they are attention seeking".
Sanders, however, hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The president has more question hours than any president before him, he says, adding further evidence without citing: We have checked those numbers
"Press conferences will still be held", Sanders said, "but I would much rather have the media ask questions directly to the president of the United States than to debate with me".
We try to do this often and you have seen us do this many times over the last few weeks, and this will replace the press release so that you can talk directly to the President of the United States.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open houses or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
It's rare to be alone at a press conference.
This week in New York, the president may have shown the reason for this by appearing uninhibited and sometimes strangely to a gathering of reporters.
The Minister for Health wrote to EU-nationals working in the Scottish public health system (NHS Scotland) about concerns about Brexit
The Minister for Health has written to the healthcare workers from EU countries in Scotland to express his gratitude and wishes for their continued presence in the country after Brexit.
The letter was sent by Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, less than six months before the United Kingdom leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to cover the costs of applying for 'settled status' for EU citizens working in specialised public services.
In his letter, Freeman writes: "Over the summer, the negotiations between the UK and the EU have progressed towards the decisions expected in the autumn.
The UK Government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal separation.
I know these are uncertain times for all of you.
I therefore want to reiterate how much we value the contribution of each of our employees, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring in valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here.
Christie Abercrombie is in emergency surgery for a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christion Abercrombie has been in emergency surgery after the team lost 31-27 to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, reports Tennessee reporter Mike Organ.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the sidelines and just fell into it", says Reed.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before putting him on a stretcher and taking him to the sideline for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State reporter told WSMV reporter Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie has been released from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that the type/ extent of the injury is unknown at this time and that Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is a sophomore at Tennessee State University, and he's playing for the first team since moving from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before he was ejected from the game, making 18 total tackles this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy property in Britain, and the extra money will be used to help the homeless under new plans by the Conservative Party.
The amendment is intended to neutralize Corby 's success in attracting young voters .
The increase in stamp duty applies to those who do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today a higher stamp duty on foreign buyers when they buy property in the UK.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract younger voters, who have made promises of more affordable housing and focused on taxing the well-off.
The increase in the stamp duty will target people and businesses who do not pay taxes to the UK, and the extra money will be used by the government to help alleviate the plight of the homeless.
The additional charge  added to the current stamp duty, in addition to the secondary and investment housing increases added two years ago  may be up to 3%.
The Treasury Secretary expects the increase to generate up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13% of new housing in London is bought by non-UK residents, which drives up prices and makes it harder for first-time home buyers to enter the owner-occupied housing market.
Many affluent areas in the UK  especially in the capital  have become  dream cities because many foreign property owners spend most of their time abroad.
The new line comes just weeks after Boris Johnson proposed lowering the stamp duty as a way to make it easier for young people to buy their first homes.
He accused the big building firms of keeping property prices high by buying land and leaving it unbuilt and called on Prime Minister May to abandon the affordable housing quotas to remedy the shameful situation of British housing.
Corbyn has published a series of striking proposals to reform the housing market, including rent cuts and an end to "confidential evictions".
He also wants to give councils more power in matters relating to the construction of new homes.
Prime Minister May says: I said last year that I would dedicate my time as Prime Minister to the British Dream  that every generation should live better than the one before it  to restore.
This means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it cannot be right that people who do not live in the UK and companies based abroad can buy homes as easily as hardworking British residents.
For too many people, owning a home has become too far-fetched a dream, and the shame of homelessness remains a reality.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead the Scotland national team".
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his "ultimate goal" is to manage the Scotland national team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is excited about the challenge of lifting back the northeast's home team, currently in third place in the British second division.
Ross moved to the Stadium of Lights this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
I made the second team and that was it, Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
As a child, I often watched Scotland games with my father at Hampden, and it's something that has always pulled me back.
The only way I'm gonna get this kind of opportunity is if I succeed as a club manager.
Ross's predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio, among others.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he was not worried about stepping into the shoes of his famous predecessors at the famous club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Iptswich Town.
Right now, I'm measuring my own success by whether I can get this club back in the Premier League.
The structure and capacity of the association make it undoubtedly a League of Nations membership', he says.
It's not easy to get there, but I would probably consider myself successful only if I could get the team back in the Premier League".
Ross has only been a manager for three years, first as assistant manager at Dumbarton and then for 15 months on the Heat coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa to promotion from the Third Division and lifted St Mirren from relegation to the Championship the following season.
Ross says he feels better now than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
I was probably at a real crossroads with my career, he recalls when he moved to the leadership of Allo.
I really believed I was better suited to be a manager than a player.
That sounds strange, because I played well, I earned moderately well, and I enjoyed some relatively high success.
But gambling can be hard.
The player has to sort out a lot of things every week.
I still go through the same things, like stress and work-related stress, but leading a team feels like the right thing to do.
I've always wanted to lead a team, and now I'm making it my job, and I feel better in my own body than I've ever felt in my adult life.
The full interview will be broadcast on Sportsound on Sunday 30 September on the Radio Scotland frequency at 12:00 and 13:00 BST.
The perfect time to enjoy a drink is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., research shows.
The summer heat wave has given a boost to pubs struggling in Britain, but at the same time added to the pressure on restaurant chains.
According to statistics, pub and bar chain sales increased by 2.7% in July, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a business consultant at CGA, says: "The continuing sunny weather and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant that July was a June-like month with pub sales up 2.8%, while restaurants had an even worse month.
The 1.8% decline in restaurant sales in June only worsened in July.
The pubs and bars that focused on drinking performed best, with like-for-like sales increasing more than the decline in restaurant sales.
Pubs focused on food also suffer from the heat, but less dramatically than restaurant operators.
It seems like people just wanted to go out and drink in their minds.
Sales of drinks in pubs and bars run by companies increased by 6.6% during the month, while food sales fell by 3%.
Paul Newman, of leisure and hotel and restaurant consultancy RSM, says: "The results continue the trend that has been ongoing since the end of April.
Weather and major social or sporting events are still the biggest factors influencing sales in the outdoor dining market.
Unsurprisingly, the struggles of the restaurant chains continue, although the annual sales decline of 4.8% is accelerating, especially now that the industry is currently struggling with cost pressures.
A long hot summer could not have been worse for the food-focused operators, and only time will tell if the cooler temperatures in August will bring the industry a much-needed respite.
The total increase in pubs and restaurants combined, including newly opened restaurants, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in the creation of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker is a sales barometer for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, which collects and analyses performance data from 47 competent groups in sectors with combined turnover of over £9 billion and is regarded as a reliable indicator of the sector.

One in five children  some as young as 11  create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapidly growing number of Instagram fake accounts, referring to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised fears that accounts may be posting sexually explicit content.
20% of pupils said they kept their 'main accounts' cleaned for their parents to see while using other private accounts.
A mother found messages from a teenager wishing to be raped after stumbling upon her 13-year-old daughter's secret Web site.
A survey by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Council (HMC) found that 40 per cent of 11-18 year olds had two separate profiles and half of those surveyed admitted to having secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, says: "It is alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them".
Eilidh Doyle Athletes' Voices to the Scottish Athletes' Council
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletes' Council as a non-executive member and will attend the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete, and Ian Beattie, chairman of the board, described the appointment as a great opportunity for sports decision-makers to benefit from the wide-ranging, international experience he has gained over the last decade.
Eilidh is highly respected by athletes in Scotland, the UK and internationally.I am sure that Scottish athletes would benefit immensely from his appointment to the board, says Beattie.
Doyle says: 'I look forward to my role as the voice of the athletes and hope to be useful in helping to steer Scottish sport in the right direction.'
The four-time Olympic gold medalist, American 200- and 400-meter runner-up at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, who now works as a regular commentator for the BBC, lost his ability to walk because of a transient brain hemorrhage.
He tweeted: "A month ago, I had a stroke".
I couldn't walk.
The doctors say only time will tell if I'll recover and how well.
This has been exhausting work, but I have made a full recovery, learned to walk again, and now I am training for agility!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!
An ad comparing mothers to cows is stirring up a rift online
An advertisement by a breast pump company that likened nursing mothers to dairy cows has caused a stir on the Internet.
Consumer electronics manufacturer Elvie has launched a product called the world's first silent, wearable breast pump, promoted by a tongue-in-cheek, music video-style advertisement that describes the freedom that the new pump brings to breastfeeding mothers.
Four real-life mothers dance in a hay-filled canopy, singing, among other things, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but I can't see my tail" and "If you haven't noticed, these aren't hips, these are boobs".
And the chorus goes, "Pump it out, pump it out, feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, milk my milkshakes".
However, the advertisement on the company's Facebook page caused a discussion online.
The video, which has been viewed 77,000 times and received hundreds of comments, has generated mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom say it makes fun of the dairy industry's daily "horrors".
The use of cattle in the advertising of this product was a very bad decision.
They must become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are stolen from them soon after birth", says one commentator.
The Elvie breast pump fits seamlessly inside the suction cup (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "Understandably, it is traumatic for both mother and baby.
But why not use them to advertise the breast pump to mothers who can keep their baby?
A third commenter added: A totally unrealistic advertisement.
I also received defenders: one woman admitted that she thought the ad was "funny".
I think this is a great idea.
I'd get one of those if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product, says one of the comments.
Another commented: This is a funny ad for mothers who pump (often at work or in the toilets) and feel like cows.
The purpose of the advertisement is not to praise or condemn the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they have been dancing with unnoticeable pumps tucked into their bras.
The concept of the advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women who use a breast pump feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely silent, has no wires and no tubes, and fits snugly inside a breastplate, giving women the freedom to move, hold the baby, and even go outside while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and artistic director of the Mother advertising agency, commented on the outcry: The Elvie pump is a revolutionary product that deserved a bold and provocative entry into the market.
By comparing breastfeeding mothers and suckling cows, we wanted to bring to light all the challenges of using a breast pump, to bring out the incredible sense of freedom that a new pump brings in an entertaining and identifying way.
The Elvie pump has made headlines before.
At London Fashion Week, the mother of two appeared on the runway wearing a costume by designer Marta Jakubowski, using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tent camp on the Texas border in total silence.
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply, despite the relatively stable monthly number of border crossings, partly because of the harsh rhetoric and policies of the Trump administration that have made it difficult to place children in foster care.
Most foster families are traditionally made up of undocumented immigrants, and registering as a foster family can jeopardise their own stay in the country.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that prospective foster families and other economic adults would be required to provide fingerprints and that this information would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, testified last week to Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who had applied for foster care for underage immigrants.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
Nearly 80% of people who are either members of a foster family or members of their households are in the country illegally, and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens.
So we will continue to look for these people", says Albence.
In an effort to speed up the processing of children's cases, the authorities have introduced new rules that in some cases require a court hearing within one month of an arrest, instead of the previous 60-day time limit, say the reception center employees.
Many prefer to appear by videoconference rather than face-to-face in immigration court.
Those not considered eligible for assistance are quickly deported.
Reports from reception centers and the system published in recent months suggest that the length of time children are in prison affects whether they develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
Lawyers say that the concern is particularly high in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where signs of a child's despair may go unnoticed because of the size of the facility.
They add that moving children to tent cities without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can cause trauma, and that many children are already suffering from trauma.
Syria orders the US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately.
The UN Secretary-General for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, also urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country is in the middle of its eighth year of war.
Moualem, who is also acting as deputy prime minister, said that foreign troops were in the country illegally under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that they would be "treated accordingly".
'They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions', he told the General Assembly.
Moualem claimed that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and where millions have been forced to flee their homes.
He said Damascus would continue its 'holy fight' until all of Syria was cleansed of both terrorist organisations and 'illegal foreign forces'.
The United States has about 2,000 troops stationed in Syria, where they are mainly training and guiding Kurds and Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has deployed more than 1,000 troops to the battle-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said conditions were good for return and accused some Western countries of spreading irrational fears that encourage refugees to stay away.
We have called on the international community and aid agencies to facilitate these returns, he said.
They politicize what should be purely humanitarian.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be granted to Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition has been reached to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last rebel base in Idlib has opened the door for political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a region of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had 'clear time limits' and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including fighters from the al-Nusra Front, which is linked to al-Qaeda, 'who will be destroyed'.
The UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a committee of members of the new government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that its work should be limited to revising the articles of the current constitution and warned against interference.
Why Trump is getting re-elected
According to this logic, President Trump would win the 2020 election unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, a viral scandal and scandal prematurely ends his presidency.
This would undoubtedly be the most dramatic end to a presidential term ever!
So far, no signs of fatigue have been observed in the audience.
Since 2014, prime time has more than doubled at CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled at MSNBC to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average peak viewership of 2.4 million, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show has reached the top of cable TV with 3.5 million viewers as the top news channel.
"This is a boom that attracts people because it's something we don't understand", says Neal Baer, executive producer of ABC's Designated Survivor, of a minister who becomes president after the attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has a different theory.
He remembers a cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he was going to vote for Trump.
Scovell asked why.
The driver said, "Because he makes me laugh", says Scovell.
Chaos has its entertainment value.
Of course, unlike other TV shows, the news from Washington can determine how Roe v. Wade goes, whether immigrant families get together, and how the global economy does.
Indifference is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it is beyond the scope of any informed citizen to watch a six-hour panel of experts debate the use of Bob Woodward's source material for his book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich coat (according to the Washington Post, "a piece of clothing that is a little too stiff") and Stormy Daniels's unadorned descriptions of President Trump's anatomy.
I, for one, can never look at Super Mario the same way I used to.
What he does feels like a reality TV show because part of it is giving the audience something every night, says Wheelhouse Entertainment CEO and Mortgage Series creator Brent Montgomery about the Trump show's changing characters and daily plot twists (NFL feud, Kim Jong-un praise).
You can't miss a single episode, or you'll fall off the wagon.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, he was at his house on the North Shore of Kaua'i on a beautiful sunny day, but he couldn't go out because he was watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't get away from a show where Brett Kavanaugh was standing before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
"I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows and people were saying it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Mr Fleiss said.
I thought it was a joke, but they were right.

Money is pouring in from the outside for a tight midterm election.
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district has faced a real cash flow, as congressional redistricting has forced two already-selected candidates to fight for one seat.
This recently redrawn Pittsburgh district is a tough challenge for Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in the second district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is competing with the other chosen candidate, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which overlaps with the new 17th district.
The redistricting was re-established after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old district's constitutional division favored the Republicans.
The race for the new 17th District has triggered a financial struggle in the finance departments of the major parties in the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became well known in Pennsylvania after the highly-watched special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat had been held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 percent.
Political commentators have been giving the Democrats a nice head start.
The United States planned to punish El Salvador for its support for China, but withdrew its plans.
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already noted the situation in Beijing and the mild reaction of Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varella in June 2017 and also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization executive team.
US State Department officials decided to recall US diplomatic leaders from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama based on recent policies that no longer recognize Taiwan, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
However, only El Salvador, which received an estimated US$140 million in US aid in 2017, was considered for sanctions, including on drugs control, development and economic aid.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit the Central American country hard with high unemployment and mortality rates.
As internal meetings progressed, the North and Central American authorities postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity, a similar meeting last year seen as a step in efforts to prevent migrants from seeking entry to the United States.
However, in mid-September senior administration officials made clear that they wanted the meeting to proceed, effectively ending speculation about possible sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now expected to give some indication of the administration's weight to the meeting, which is scheduled for mid-October, diplomats said.
The three American ambassadors mentioned in the report returned in silence to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further unpleasant messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on details of the conversation with three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal matters anonymously.
Their report was corroborated by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
History teaches us
The next inevitable step may be Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on President Trump's possible obstruction of justice, for which there is now very strong evidence in public records.
Mueller is also reportedly investigating whether the Trump campaign was secretly working with Russia when Russia interfered in the US election.
If Congress changes its power, President Trump will find himself held accountable just as he prepares to go before his constituents again, and possibly face the judgment of his peers.
There is a lot of talk here, and I am not saying that the defeat of President Trump is inevitable, or that the defeat of his counterparts in Europe is.
We must find solutions on both sides of the Atlantic, and those solutions will determine how long this struggle will last.
In 1938, the German authorities would have been ready to overthrow Hitler if the West had also opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the chance to avoid years of carnage.
The course of history is marked by such turning points, where the inevitable march of democracy either accelerates or slows down.
Americans are now facing several of these turning points.
What do we do if President Trump fires Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is in charge of the Mueller case?
Rosenstein has been charred since it became public that he had proposed a secret recording of the president's speech and questioned the president's possible inability to discharge his duties.
Rosenstein says the Times report is wrong.
How do we respond if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanugh's activities is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony?
And most importantly, in the midterm elections, will we vote for a Congress that holds President Trump accountable?
If we fail in these attempts, our democracy will be plunged into a long, dark winter.
But I believe we're going to succeed because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia, and she was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once filled my diplomatic box.
He survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that table decorated with a hammer.
How could I not be optimistic about the future with this legacy?

Graham Dorran of the Rangers optimistic about Rapid Vienna .
Rangers face Rapid Vienna at home on Thursday, knowing that after a draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, a win over Austria would give the team a strong position to enter the Europa League G-block.
A knee injury has prevented midfielder Graham Dorrance from getting on the field this season ahead of a 2-2 draw at Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for better results.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good opponent", says the 31-year-old.
We went into the game expecting to get something and bring home a point.
Maybe we could have gotten the win at the end, but all in all, the draw is probably a fair result.
I guess they were better in the first half and we got a little bit more speed in the second half and we were better.
Thursday is another big night in the Europa League.
We hope to get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they did a good job in the last game, but I believe with the support of this crowd we can give our best and we'll get a positive result.
Last year was really tough with my own injuries and the changes in the team, but now I feel good.
The lineup is good and the boys are enjoying it; training is going well.
Hopefully we can now push hard, put the league season behind us and succeed.
Fear of retirement savings robs women of sleep
Although the study participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few had talked about it with their loved ones.
About half of the participants in a national survey said that they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent of the respondents said that they had discussed the matter with their children.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't bring it up", says Holly Snyder, vice president of the National Life Insurance Company.
Start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not make your wishes known in time.
Talk to your professional and your family about where and how to get help, as these questions are an important cost factor.
Include financial advice in the discussion: it can also help you to find a way to cover these costs.
Long-term care financing options may include traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance to cover these costs or self-insurance if you can afford it.
Draft legal documents: prevent legal disputes.
Get a health care representative on site so that you can appoint a trusted person to supervise your medical care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes in case you are unable to communicate with them.
Consider also drawing up a power of attorney for handling your financial affairs.
It can help you to appoint a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and to make sure that your bills are paid if you are unable to take care of them yourself.
Also, remember the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent is on his way to the hospital because of a medical emergency.
Can you answer any questions about his medication and allergies?
Write such information down in your plan to prepare for the situation.
"It's not just a question of money, who's his doctor?"
What medicines are used?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Keep the plan ready.
A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle in Ilfracomb.
The man was shot several times with an air rifle as he walked home late at night.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
Police describe the attack, which occurred at approximately 2:30 a.m., as an "accidental act".
The victim didn't see the assailant.
The victim's injuries are not life-threatening and police have cited eyewitnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a massive earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Punjab on Friday, officials say the death toll is expected to rise.
As communications are cut off in the area, rescue authorities have not received any information from the area north of Phun, Donggala Municipality, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated in Palma since the disaster.
Key information on Palus and Donggala on Sulawes Island:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The earthquake and tsunami hit in the middle of the city's 40th anniversary celebration.
Donggala Municipality extends over 300 kilometres (180 mi) of coastline on the northwestern tip of Sulawesi Island.
Donggala Municipality is a provincial administrative region with an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
The main economic activities in Central Sulawesi and particularly in the coastal region of Donggala are fishing and agriculture.
Nickel mining is also important, but it is concentrated in Morowal on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit by several tsunamis in the past century.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
Some of the most severe earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake in North Sumatra, on the western coast of Aceh Province, Indonesia, caused a tsunami on December 26, which struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the southern part of Indonesia's most populous island, Java, causing a tsunami that struck the island's southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake hits one of the Mentawai Islands in Sumatra, causing a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed several villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A massive earthquake hits the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, causing devastation and panic as people remember the devastation caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but over a hundred people died when the buildings collapsed.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily isolated thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin 's oldest son was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence .
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate, has been arrested on charges of aggravated assault.
According to an Alaskan police report Saturday, Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and obstruction of domestic violence and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, Palin took the phone from her female companion as she tried to call the police to report alleged crimes.
Palin is in custody at Mat-Su Pretrial Detention Center and has been released on $500 bail, KTUU TV reports.
According to the report, Palin appeared in court on Saturday and pleaded "not guilty".
Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, which means he faces a maximum of one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He's also charged with a Class B misdemeanor punishable by up to a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin's been accused of a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father Todd Palin.
That's when Palin's mother called the police and reported the robbery.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, Palin was charged with domestic violence, which involved possession of a weapon while under the influence of drugs.
Palin's girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior to traumatic stress disorder resulting from his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: Hundreds dead
At least 384 people have been killed since an earthquake struck Sulawesi Island in Indonesia on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and communications are down and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck just outside the central Sulawesi, northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There's a video circulating on social media of the moment of the quake.
Hundreds of people had gathered for beach festivals in the city of Palun when the tsunami struck the coast.
Federal prosecutors are considering a rare death sentence for a suspect in the New York City terror attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the terrorist attack that killed eight people in New York City, a rare death sentence that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
The indictment alleges that Saipov, 30, used a Home Depot rental car in his October hit-and-run on the West Side Highway in Manhattan, where he ran over pedestrians and cyclists.
According to the Southern District of New York's death penalty application, the death penalty is possible if prosecutors can prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight of his victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily harm.
According to the court document, both of these charges carry the death penalty.
Weeks after the attack, a federal court indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of aiding and abetting a terrorist organization, a term typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases.
The attack required "considerable planning and preparation", prosecutors noted, describing Saipov's conduct as "horrific, cruel and shameful".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, harm and loss to the families of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decad, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruch, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, the statement of claim states.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It has been a decade since the Southern District of New York last handed down a death sentence.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murders of two drug dealers, but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in New York was in a federal case in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple, were executed for conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed no signs of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he did, police said.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities he was inspired to launch the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police said Saipov also wanted an ISIS ticket to his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defender representing Saipovi, said the defense was "naturally disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty rather than a confession and life without the possibility of parole is a solution that only prolongs the trauma caused by these events, Patton said.
Saipov's defense had previously requested that he not be sentenced to death.
The Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should be put in charge of the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage today at a protest against the Conservatives promised to mobilise a civilian army.
The former UKIP leader said politicians must feel the pressure of Euroscepticism when one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested he lead negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative MP Peter Bone told marchers in Birmingham that Britain would be out already if Farage were Brexit secretary.
But May faces a challenge in reconciling her deeply divided ranks, highlighted by the Remain Conservatives who joined a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his Chequers compromise proposal afloat under pressure from Brexit supporters and opponents, as well as the EU.
Supporters demand that he continue his efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the setback and force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between his proposal and chaos.
Bone said at the Leave Means Leaven event in Solihull that he wanted to "slap the Chequers bill away".
He suggested that Farage should be included and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we'd be out of here", he said.
The MEP for Wellingborough added: 'I support Brexit, but the Chequers proposal must be scrapped.'
He expressed his opposition to the EU, saying: 'We did not fight world wars to become subservient.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Bone dismissed the idea that public opinion had changed after the 2016 vote: That the British had changed their mind and wanted to stay is a completely false claim.
The Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march and told reporters: I will say only: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The people do not support the Chequers proposal, the opposition will not vote for it, and it will not be supported by party members or activists who are really taking to the streets and are fully responsible for our success.
You guys, drop the Chequers proposal and start listening.
In a message to May, he added: 'Prime Ministers can keep their jobs if they keep their promises.'
Farage said politicians need to feel pressure if they are going to overturn a decision made following the 2016 referendum.
He said that the EU had to be more transparent and more transparent.
They are trying to water down Brexit and we are here today to tell them that we do not accept it.
Speaking to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: 'I want the politicians who are trying to stop Brexit to feel the pressure from you.'
We will mobilise the army of the people of this country, who gave us the victory in the Brexit vote, and we will not rest until Britain is once again an independent, self-governing and proud nation.
Meanwhile, pro-Remain protesters march through Birmingham ahead of a two-hour event in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved signs "Tories Against Brexit" and the group was formed this weekend.
Lord Adonis of the Labour Party mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they had with the party app at the start of the meeting.
These are the people who say they will get the IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus arrangement and smooth border operations for free trade in Ireland, he added.
It's a complete farce.
He said there was no such thing as a good Brexit.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, known for his repeated criticism of President Trump, will face Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign, in the November re-election.
Warren has been speculated as a possible candidate to run against Trump in the 2020 election.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoake was his 36th town hall meeting with voters since Trump began his term.
One of the contestants asked if Warren was going to run for president.
Warren replied that now was the time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top.
Arrest in the LSU Sims shooting.
Baton Rouge, Louisiana police said Saturday they have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11:00 a.m. ET today at a news conference.
Police had released a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help identifying the man seen in it.
Sims, 20, was shot near the Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media Saturday on 247 Sports.
Wayde was defending his friend, and that's when Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted to being present at the interrogation, to possessing a weapon and to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resisting arrest and taken to the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims was a 6-foot-8 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games and made 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
The Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship after the team standings offered him a win over Sebastian Vettel
When Valtteri Bottas passed Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes' team arrangements are important in the race.
Bottas got off to a good start and left Hamilton almost on his own luck defending his spot in the first two rounds, calling Vettel on his teammate.
Vettel went to the warehouse first, leaving Hamilton to drive the pack on his tail, which should have settled the situation.
Mercedes went into the garage later in the lap and returned to chase Vettel, but Hamilton passed after a bit of contact and a Ferrari reluctantly moving from the inside line, giving up his position defending just two-thirds of the way through the turn.
Max Verstappen, who had just celebrated his 21st birthday, started from the back row and was seventh after the first round.
After that, he was in the lead for much of the race, extending the tyre change, aiming for a quick finish and a fourth place finish from Kimi Räikkönen.
He finally came into the garage on lap 44, but was unable to increase speed for the remaining eight laps as Räikkönen took fourth place.
This was a difficult day because Valtteri performed brilliantly all weekend and was a real gentleman in letting me pass.
The team has done an exceptional job, winning the double", said Hamilton.
Very bad body language .
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein's claim on Saturday that she had not leaked a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a ceremony in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee but said that what was going on in the Senate was a demonstration of the wickedness, wickedness and dishonesty of the people.
"The one possible thing, the wonderful thing that's been going on in the Senate for the last few days, is we're seeing anger, people who are angry, mean, naughty and dishonest", the president said.
When we see the publications and the leaks and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak this information?
Do you remember his answer... did you leak the document... oh, what?
Oh, my God.
I didn't bleed.
Wait a minute, please.
Did we leak? No, we didn't leak, he added, sniffing the senator.
Feinstein received a letter in July describing the allegations against Ford Kavanaugh and the letter was leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak had occurred from his office.
"I did not cover up Professor Ford's allegations, nor did I leak his story", Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as he wished.
But his ban did not sit well with the president, who commented on the matter at a Saturday event: "Let me tell you, that was very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen.
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court nominee who has been accused of sexual harassment by three women and felt the Democrats were using the allegations to their advantage.
They are determined to get back to power by any means necessary.
You see the malice and the depravity, they don't care who they hurt or who they have to walk over to get to power and rule", Mediaite reports the president saying.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants , and the first round of the playoffs .
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee .
Dundee Stars have claimed compensation for their Elite League defeat to Belfast Giants on Friday, beating Dundee 5-3 on Saturday.
The Giants had a lead early in the game, thanks to two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team to the level before Dwyer returned the Giants to the lead.
Francois Bouchard tied Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundwald secured the win.
This was the third Elite League loss of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
The teams faced off for the fourth time this season after the Giants won their previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth with 3:35 left in the game from Kendall McFaul, a David Rutherford pitch as Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In the lightning opening quarter, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt scored the Cowboys' equalizing goal at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead for the first half, scoring his second goal of the night late in the first period.
The home team rallied and Bouchard again tied the lead with a time of 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces and Nielsen was able to give Dundee their first lead in the bottom of the second inning, and he also secured the win with his team's fifth goal midway through the final inning.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will face off at home Friday night at Milton Keynes.
The flight attendant died making sure that the hundreds of passengers on board escaped the earthquake
In Indonesia, a pilot has become a hero after his death for ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers took off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and several are missing after a powerful earthquake and resulting tsunami struck Sulawes on Friday.
Strong aftershocks are hitting the area and several people are trapped in the collapsed material in the city of Palu.
Despite the risk of his fellow workers fleeing, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung did not leave his job in the wildly swaying control tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufrin Airport in Palus.
He stayed put and made sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was now on the runway, got off safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower, which he thought was about to collapse.
He died later in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia correspondent Yohannes Sirait said Agung's decision could save hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
From Balikpapan, Kalimantan, a helicopter was prepared to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter could reach Palus.
'This news breaks our hearts', he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could rise to thousands as disaster officials report poor connections to Donggala, Sig and Boutong.
The death toll is believed to be still rising as many bodies are buried in the rubble and many people have not been reached, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo said.
Waves up to 20 feet [6 m] in height have devastated Palun, where a mass funeral is being held on Sunday.
Military and cargo planes are bringing aid and supplies to the area.
Risa Kusuma, 35, a mother of three, told Sky News: "Ambulances bring bodies all the time.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets are being robbed everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, the Indonesian director of the International Red Cross, said in an interview with CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we don't know what to expect.
This is already a tragedy, but it could prove even worse.
President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said in a speech to the country's armed forces: "I ask you all to work day and night to ensure that all evacuation tasks can be completed.
Are you ready? CNN News.
Earlier this year, more than 550 people were killed in earthquakes in Lombok, Indonesia.
Air Niugini says one person is missing after a plane crashed into a lagoon .
Airline officials report that one person is missing after a plane crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia, although earlier reports said that all 47 passengers and crew members had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini says it hasn't been able to locate a single male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and accident investigators to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to questions about additional information on the missing passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Airport.
Authorities announced Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six people were hospitalized Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact course of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both reported that the plane landed in a lagoon just before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had crashed into the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed very low.
"It's a very good thing", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that the passengers were able to wrap themselves in the waist-deep water of the sinking plane for emergency exits.
He said that the passenger crew panicked and screamed, and that he himself suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working on a nearby pier helped rescue people by carrying them ashore in rubber dinghies before the plane sank to a depth of about 100 feet [30 m].
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in accidents involving airlines registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but Air Niugini has not been involved.
The analyst is presenting a timeline for the night the woman was burned alive.
The prosecutor's office on Saturday completed a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of data analytics.
He described to the jury how he had used cell phone records to piece together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the victim's death.
Rowlett said he had obtained location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contrary to earlier claims, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the records showed that Tellis' cell phone was at Chambers' house at the same time that Tellis claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, police questioned Sanford.
Sanford testified Saturday that he wasn't in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford replied that Tellis "lies because my car was in Nashville".
The second inconsistency was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
According to the cell phone records, they'd only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contacts from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life", Hale said.
The defense's final arguments are scheduled to begin Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to proceed to a jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is hip hop consciousness?
The hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative perceptions of the genre by making music that is full of positive messages.
According to the Bristol-based group The High Breed, hip-hop has moved away from its original message of politics and social problems.
They want to go back to the roots of hip hop and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have been able to witness the new rise of Britain with artists like Akalan and Lowkey.
Another dark one?!
A New York nanny is suing a couple over a racist text message .
A New York nanny sues a couple for discriminatory separation after accidentally receiving a text message from the child's mother complaining that she is "another black person".
The couple deny being racists and equate the challenge to blackmail.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her grief when new nanny Giselle Maurice arrived at work on her first day in 2016 and discovered that she was dark skinned.
Yesterday, back in the States, Plasco-Flaxman texted her husband.
But then she sent a message to Giselle Maurice, twice, instead of her husband.
After realizing his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman, troubled, according to the New York Post, had fired Maurice, saying that their previous African-American nanny, who had received their passports, had failed her job and was expecting a Filipino this time.
Maurice was paid for one day's work and sent home by taxi.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for severance pay, seeking $350 a day for the six months he was initially forced to live and work with the family, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them that you can't do that", she told the Post on Friday, adding: "I know it's discriminatory".
The couple have responded to racist allegations by saying that terminating Maurice's employment was a justified decision because they could not trust him after offending him.
My wife sent him something she didn't mean to say.
He's not a racist.
We are not racists", Joel Plasco told the Post.
But would you leave your child in the care of someone to whom you have been unkind, even if only accidentally?
Your newborn baby?
Really?
Plasco challenged me to blackmail and I told him that his wife had given birth two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation".
Do you go after someone in a situation like this?
It is not a very pleasant thing to do, the investment banker added.
While the trial is still ongoing, public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media, taunting their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that the Paddington publishers were afraid that the audience would identify with the talking bear.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was approved, says of the letter: "It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of someone who read a book for the first time before it was published.
It's funny now that Paddington's huge popularity is known.
Noting that her father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before devoting himself to writing children's books about the adventures of a teddy bear, would have been optimistic about rejecting her book, Jankel added that the 60th anniversary of the books' publication felt bittersweet because her father had died the previous year.
He described Paddington as a "very important member of the family" and said his father was quietly proud of his success.
He was a rather quiet man, and not the kind to be a bit of a tease, says the daughter.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like a child's achievement to him; something you're proud of, even if it's not really your own achievement.
I think that's how he experienced the success of Paddington.
Even though it was his creation, he always gave the credit to Paddington for himself.
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
Her daughter had been rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice after the plane landed, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
Nad called from time to time and told me that the situation was very bad and that she was not expected to survive, says Ednan-Laperouse.
Then Nad called and said that my daughter was gonna die in a few minutes and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
So I did.
I said, "I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you in a minute.
I'm with you.
The drugs that the doctors used to keep his heart beating were gradually leaving his system.
He was dead a little while ago, and now everything's gone.
I could just sit there knowing it was all coming to an end.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I had to keep my cool.
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers who knew nothing of the ordeal she was going through.
"No one knew", he said.
I kept my head down and tears were flowing all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt a huge sense of compassion for Nadia.
That she needed my love and understanding right now.
I knew how much he loved my daughter.
Grief-stricken women send cards to prevent suicides on the bridge .
Two women who have lost loved ones work to prevent other people from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys send out cards with encouraging messages and a phone number for support.
Davis' son Tyler fell into depression at age 13 and committed suicide at 18.
"I would not want any parent to have to experience the feelings I feel every day", she said.
Davis, 45, of Lydney, says that his son was a promising cook with an infectious grin.
He was known for his smile.
Everyone said her smile would light up the whole room.
However, he stopped working before his death because he felt that he was in "darkness".
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found his brother who had taken his own life.
Davis says he's constantly afraid of the aftermath.
Davis created the cards to tell people that there are people you can go to talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't be silent. You have to talk.
Humphreys has been a friend of Davies' for many years, and he lost his partner Mark after 15 years of marriage shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't tell me he was down or depressed or anything like that", Humphreys said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in her behavior.
He was right down on Christmas Day, and when the kids opened their presents, he didn't make eye contact or anything like that.
She says Mark's death was a severe trauma for them, but they still need to move on: It's breaking up the family.
It'll tear us apart.
But we just have to move on and keep fighting.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake as the FBI begins its investigation.
'I thought that if we could really get what he wanted - a limited in time and scope inquiry - we might be able to achieve some unity,' Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would 'disintegrate' because of the deadlock caused by supporters.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters refuse to allow the FBI to investigate?
Reluctance is about timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, November 6th, and if the Republican success rate is weak as expected, their bid to get the man they want on the Supreme Court will be hampered.
George W. Bush has taken the phone and called the senators to lobby them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House during the Bush administration and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was President Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI report is filed?
The Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, is holding a vote.
It's still unclear if Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes, which would give Vice President Mike Pence enough to blow the game and confirm his nomination to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors is falling during Kim 's reign .
According to a South Korean lawmaker, the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug quoted the South Korean Ministry of Unification as saying that there were 1,127 violations last year, and 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the key factors were the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the rise in prices for human traffickers.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly on the matter.
Most North Korean defectors will eventually be granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone between the Koreas.
China treats defectors as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and most often forcibly returns them.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the countries met in Pyongyang and discussions focused on the stalled talks on nuclear disarmament.
This followed a historic meeting in June, where US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un met in Singapore and agreed on a general level on the pursuit of denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho criticized the United States for sticking to sanctions after the meeting.
'Without any kind of trust from the US, our national security is not on a reliable footing and under such circumstances we will not unilaterally start dismantling our weapons first', Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was temporarily unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Your fear commented on this in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had behaved like that, she would be called 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her own reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh very emotionally denied the allegations that he sexually harassed Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was overcome with emotion, and at times he would almost scream and lose his speech as he told stories about his family and high school years.
He also strongly condemned the Democratic members of the committee, without calling the accusations against him "grotesque and a systematic persecution of a person" organized by liberals angry about Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential election loss.
Mr. Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because it showed his bias toward the Democrats.
'I believe he made himself incompetent with his statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats,' Pelosi said.
Your fear was raised when asked if he would impeach Kavanaugh if his election was confirmed and the Democrats won a majority in the House.
"Let's put it this way - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not qualified not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he currently works", Pelosi replied.
Kavanaugh is currently serving on the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
Your fear added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible orders on health care reform or Roe v. Wade, because Kavanaugh is known as a conservative justice.
During his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
'This is not the time for a hysterical and biased person to be elected to the Court and we are expected to say that it is wonderful,' Pelosi said.
Women have to get by on everything .
It is a legitimate fiery speech in the heat of months and years of rage, and he cannot hold it without weeping.
"We cry when we're angry", Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think it's anything unusual, do you?
She continued: "I was helped tremendously by a woman in a leadership position somewhere who told me that she too cried when she was angry, but that she had developed a way of saying to her interlocutors in situations where she got angry and started crying: 'You might think I'm sad now because I'm crying.
I'm really mad.
And then he just kept going.
And I thought that was brilliant.
Though generally misunderstood, tears are justified as a way to vent anger.
One of my fondest memories of my early work in a manly office is that one day I cried in a rage and an older woman - a cold-blooded supervisor I had always been a little afraid of - grabbed me by the neck and pulled me up the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", he said.
They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad and then they're happy because they got your mind hurt.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
When Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on the Monkey Business in 1987 and was eliminated from the race, a deeply frustrated Schroeder felt there was no reason why he should not run for president himself.
It was not a very well thought-out decision, he told me laughing 30 years later.
There were already seven candidates and at least one more was needed.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
With the campaign running late, he was behind on fundraising, so he announced that he would not run unless he raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
He realized that some of his supporters who had given the male candidates a thousand dollars had given him only 250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she thought.
When she gave the speech announcing that she would not be formally campaigning, she was overcome by emotions - gratitude to her supporters, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds for voters and not for delegates, and anger at sexism - that she couldn't speak.
"I could have thought I was going to have a nervous breakdown", recalls Schroeder, "but the press reacted.
You'd think Kleenex would be my sponsor.
I remember thinking, "I'm sure my headstone will be beaten up for a memorial".
He was crying.
How the US-China trade war can benefit Beijing
The opening shot in the U.S.-China trade war was a deafening one, and while the fight is far from over, the two countries' dispute may benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year by imposing import tariffs on China's main exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week with new tariffs affecting imports worth $200bn (£150bn), effectively taxing half of all Chinese imports into the US.
Beijing has responded in kind each time, most recently imposing tariffs of between 5 and 10 percent on $60 billion worth of American imports.
China has promised to respond to the United States with an eye for an eye and the world's second largest economy does not seem to be in a state of decline for a moment.
To make Washington back down would mean giving in to its own demands, but public bowing to the United States would be far too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the U.S. trade war could have a long-term positive effect on China by reducing interdependence.
A quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the conditions that will trigger an economic downturn in either country, and this is actually a more dangerous possibility than observers have hitherto realised, says Abigail Grace, research assistant with Asia at the Center for New American Securities think tank.
The Syrian Foreign Minister says the country is "ready" for the return of refugees
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country after more than seven years of devastating war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country were improving.
The situation is now more stable and secure thanks to the developments in the fight against terrorism, he said.
The government will continue to repair areas devastated by terrorists to restore normalcy.
The conditions now allow for the voluntary return of refugees to the country from which they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures against their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are still six million people in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would be grateful for assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
He stressed, however, that the government would not accept conditional aid or assistance from states that supported the rebels.
The European team has confirmed its victory in the Ryder Cup in Paris .
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the United States team by 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six straight in Europe, and they haven't won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team kept the crown as its Danish captain Thomas Bjørn's team scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson struggled for most of the tournament and he hit his opening water-ball on the 16th hole of the par-3 course, giving the fight to Francesco Molinar.
Italy's Molinari excelled in all rounds, becoming one of only four players to record a 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was eliminated in the 5& 4 final against the lowest ranked player in the European team, Thorbjørn Olesen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, ranked number one in the world, lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter, who could now play his final Ryder Cup.
Eight-time Ryder Cup golfer Sergio Garcia of Spain became the tournament's all-time leading European with a career total of 25.5 points.
I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a rough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy to have this win.
It is a team and I am happy to have been of help', said Garcia, moved by the European team's victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot Jon Rahm, who won the 2&1 singles event Sunday against American golf legend Tiger Woods.
"I feel immense pride in beating Tiger Woods, who I grew up admiring", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now holds a Ryder Cup rookie record of 13-21-3.
Strange statistics from one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had difficulty finding their way through the entire weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finaut, who played at a high level throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk said after his team's failed performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
We've been pushing the European team in the games this morning.
We made a deal.
- Thank you.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're gonna regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're gonna move on.
These 12 guys are amazing and I'm proud to be their captain.
I've got to get my hat on.
We faced our winner.
Red tide flowering status: decreasing concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
According to a recent report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, there is a general decline in algae in the Tampa Bay area.
The FWC has identified more scattered algal areas in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier Counties, which may indicate a decrease in concentrations.
The red tide salmon runs along the coast for about 130 miles from Pinellas to southern Lee County.
Ferries can be seen within 10 miles of the Hillsborough County coast, but they're fewer than last week.
Red tide algae blooms have also been spotted in Pasco County.
Moderate concentrations were reported from the Pinellas County coastline last week, with concentrations ranging from low to high on the Hillsborough County coastline, background concentrations from high to high in Manatee and Sarasota counties, background concentrations from moderate to high in Charlotte County and background concentrations from high to low on the Lee County coastline and Collier County.
Respiratory symptoms are still being reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
Over the past week, there have been no reports of respiratory symptoms in the northwest Florida area.
