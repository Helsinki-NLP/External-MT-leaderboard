Food blamed for European inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation measured in the euro area is the rapidly rising food prices.
Inflation in the 13 countries of the euro zone was higher than expected in November - after the 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was registered, as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts put the figure at just 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the Federal Reserve of the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered its benchmark interest rate, which it believes would encourage the creation of an inflationary spiral by rising commodity prices and a slight drop in unemployment.
The ECB aims to keep inflation below two percent, or at least close to the two percent mark.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in a quandary: inflation must be "coordinated" in order to rule out the need for further action.
At 3.3 percent, the inflation rate reached a 12-year record high in Germany in November; in Spain, the rate climbed from 3.6 percent to 4.1 percent.
The rise in inflation in the eurozone was due to the rise in food and energy prices.
Wheat prices rose 88 percent, and the price of soybeans also hit a record high since 1973.
The price of cooking oil and dairy products also increased considerably in 2007.
The world price of crude oil has risen 52 percent this year - last month, the price per barrel of black gold reached nearly $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1% to 2.5% in 2008, but is expected to fall to 1.9% in 2009.
Analysts expect inflation to reach 3 percent in the next 3-4 months, but put the average annual rate at 2.1 percent.
Experts expect the ECB to cut interest rates twice in 2008.
Gallup finds government crisis
After a long period of stagnation, the number of Fidesz sympathizers grew significantly by early December, with the party having its largest base camp for the first time since 2002, while support for the Socialists reached an all-time low of 13%, according to Gallup.
Among party-loyal voters, the difference is clear thanks to the high determination of opposition supporters: more than two-thirds (71 percent) oppose a fifth (20 percent) support for the MSZP.
According to the survey, the MDF and SZDSZ are below the parliamentary entry barrier: they reach two percent of the total population.
The number of party voters has grown by one per cent in both camps.
Compared to the last low point, the general economic mood has deteriorated further - the share of those who say the country's economic situation is "decidedly bad" has never been this high (41%), while a further 46% consider it "pretty bad."
After more hopeful prospects in the spring and summer, families are again more pessimistic about the change in their financial situation.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expects the situation to deteriorate further; only a tenth expect it to improve.
A Gallup poll conducted in December found that 71% of respondents - an all-time high - rated the prime minister's job "more bad than right."
Thirteen percent of respondents have great confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány in general, while the share of those in favour of Viktor Orbán is 38 percent.
Some 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared with 27% who do not trust the Fidesz leader.
One of the indicators of the political mood is the number of those who believe that dissatisfaction with the prime minister can be controlled even without a change of government.
Whereas after the riots last October, 35% of the electorate voted for the government and the head of government to remain, today this figure stands at only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) sees the solution only in new elections.
Asked about their interest in the referendum, 60 per cent said they would "certainly" vote and a further 20 per cent would "probably" vote.
By way of comparison, if the parliamentary elections were held this Sunday, only 55% would "certainly" go to the polls, and a further 15% consider their participation "likely." Given these trends, the outcome of the referendum would be predictable.
74% would vote against tuition fees, 79% against the practice fee, and 84% against the hospital day allowance.
Applied to the group of people who "certainly" took part in the referendum, the proportion opposed to tuition, practice and hospital fees would be 81, 84 and 89 per cent respectively.
Auchan most expensive, Tesco increases by almost a fifth
Hypermarkets in the Buda trade area have maintained the average price increase of 16% from last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Article from Napi Gazdaság
In the trade triangle of Buda, the price of the usual Napi Christmas basket has increased by 16 percent this year, but price increases of more than 1,000 HUF have been registered in all hypermarkets.
After prices in the food markets "galloped away" last December, the percentage of inflation has not been drastic, compared with the already high, earlier starting level.
However, it certainly has a deterrent effect on consumers that what they paid well below 9,000 HUF last year is not even available for 10,000 HUF this year.
The price of the "Napi" basket exceeded the magic 10,000 HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the markets examined.
The highest price was 10.573 HUF.
(In 6800 the price was 6.800 HUF.)
The prices of Unicum and live fish remained almost at the same level as last year, but prices for turkey breast fillets, nuts and poppy seeds rose sharply.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but Auchan had 1kg bread for 139 forints.
There was no fall in the price of the product to below 200 forints due to competition.
Also surprising was the price of a two litre Coca-Cola deposit bottle of less than 200 HUF, so the drink including the deposit cost only 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, in the Napi basket comparison this year, Auchan was the most expensive, and Cora the cheapest.
Our calculations have shown that Cora's "Napi" basket prices have increased by 15 per cent compared to Christmas prices last year, while Tesco and Auchan have both increased by 18 per cent.
The difference between last year's cheapest basket and this year's most expensive was 12%, while the increase between last year's cheapest basket and this year's most expensive was 21%.
The average price increase was 1.480,00 HUF.
The average price increase in the previous year was still 1,206.00 Forints, but the VAT increase was noticeable in the prices at last Christmas.
It is precisely this process that has hit retail hard: it seems that department stores have been unable to decide which price range to apply to individual articles, as the impact of the price increase on consumer behaviour has been incalculable.
(If the trader does not plan the circulation speed of a product well, he may lose substantial profits in the price range, which depends on traffic intensity.)
Due to VAT, the inflation of the "Napi" basket last year was so radical that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 Forints, whereas the price difference for the cheapest basket was only 844 Forints.
This year, such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost 1,630.00 forints more than the previous year, and even the cheapest saw a price increase of 1,284.00 forints.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, there has been a catastrophic price increase, with the price of daily consumables in hypermarkets rising by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily corroborate the data from the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: for some basic foodstuffs, the Statistical Office found inflation of more than 30% over a 12-month period.
In addition to flour, eggs are about the same.)
However, if you take a look at the "Napi" shopping cart, this seems almost impossible with the latter, as the price level of the product, which was already expensive last year, has risen by barely more than 10 percent even in the worst case scenario.
Obviously, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than egg suppliers - after all, they have been able to pass on the drastic price increase to the multinationals.
In the golden trading triangle, the hypermarkets do not complain; good years are constantly reported.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores no longer look at the prices.
Large quantities are purchased from everything, durable food is shipped over the counter in pallets.
On Wednesday morning, there were endless queues at the checkout in all three department stores when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, the country reports a lower customer frequency, so that many multinationals complain to pollsters that they cannot even achieve the planned turnover, not only for food, but also for sustainable consumer goods.
In many places there is a saving on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections have been recorded in hospitals due to improper use of antibiotics.
Hygienic conditions in hospitals, overcrowding of beds, overcrowding of staff - these are all factors that are not conducive to containing infections, according to the chief medical officer of the National Epidemiology Centre.
In many places, savings are also being made on disinfectants.
Recently, a MRSA infection was diagnosed in the Traumatology Department of the János Hospital.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was found in a male patient who was hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, there was a similar infection here.
The injured man in a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital, but shortly afterwards the man had to return with an MRSA infection. Since then, an important operation could not be carried out because of the bacterium that is still present in the patient's body.
As of December 10 of this year, 1,094 infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens have been reported to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System from hospitals, according to Karolina Böröcz, senior physician at the National Center for Epidemiology.
So many multi-drug-resistant infections have certainly been recorded in hospitals, but the number is likely to be higher.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were caused by MRSA, Staphylococcus aureus, which is resistant to methicillin oxacillin.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carries about a third of people in their noses without causing disease.
SA-related infections (such as sore throat, tonsillitis, inflammation of the skin or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics and are easily cured.
However, if the remedies are overdosed or improperly applied, the well-responding bacteria develop into antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which spread rapidly in hospitals under appropriate conditions.
These bacteria can cause severe infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis, especially in patients with weakened or permanently poorly functioning immune systems, but also in older patients or patients with low body weight.
According to the medical director of the János hospital, the MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents are part of the daily routine of the hospital.
One should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, warned Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA only does not exist where it is not sought.
Resistant to antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, nurses wear rubber gloves and masks during care, and we have the necessary antibiotics for treatment," says Tibor Nyulasi.
When they are admitted to the hospital, the patients are examined for MRSA, but an infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling too rare
The majority of infections caused by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, however, the currently prevailing conditions and circumstances are unfavorable for the control of the emergence or spread of the multi-resistant pathogen, says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection occurs predominantly in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine the admitted patients and isolate MRSA-infected patients immediately.
However, microbiological sampling is not as common in Hungarian hospitals.
Not least because there is no subsidy from the state health insurance fund for this investigation.
Most cases would therefore only come to light if the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the medical director of the epidemiology center.
The European Union has strict recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines in Hungary for the treatment of certain infections and diseases.
Antibiotic therapies should be targeted, i.e. microbiological studies are necessary to prevent resistance to the drug, but this directive is not always followed by hospitals.
According to Karolina Böröcz, microbiological sampling is even rarer among outpatients or primary care patients.
It is saved with the disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most often transmitted from one patient to another by nursing staff.
Precisely for this reason, hand washing or wearing gloves and masks is of great importance, but there are also considerable shortcomings in this area in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection or contact, but in domestic hospitals it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
In fact, the rooms are often overcrowded, with beds lined up next to each other, although from an epidemiological point of view there should be a distance of at least 1.5 metres between them.
Unfortunately, as Karolina Böröcz further points out, in the less well-off hospitals, savings are even being made on disinfectants, there are few nurses, many patients - all factors that almost encourage the development of infections.
According to Karolina Böröcz, infections of this kind are demonstrably far less common there, or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped if these protective measures are adhered to.
Government programme against MRSA
Getting MRSA infections under control causes enormous costs for health insurance companies, therefore they are fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention and control of MRSA was included in the government programme.
According to the first signs, the program is successful - as published data prove, the tendency of MRSA infections in England is decreasing.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has made the prevention of the emergence of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of infections in hospitals one of its priorities.
Death row police chief wasn't drunk
In the case of the fatal car accident caused by the police chief of the XXII. District, the official report is now available.
The now resigned police chief of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian in a car accident on Tuesday, was neither drunk nor under the influence of drugs, Attila Morvai, the spokesman of the Budapest Chief Public Prosecutor's Office, said on Friday after the official report on the case was presented.
The report confirmed the results of the initial investigation, according to which the police chief had not consumed alcohol before getting behind the wheel.
The former police chief turned into Kossuth Lajos Street in the XXII district in his own car and ran over a 55-year-old man who was crossing the street at an unmarked place.
(According to the StVO, however, this is not a mitigating circumstance - the driver, even if pedestrians do not cross the road at the zebra crossing, has second place.)
The pedestrian succumbed to his injuries after being taken to hospital.
According to police reports, the driver suffered a shock, then resigned and asked to retire.
The Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office has opened its investigation into the incident.
In addition, Attila Morvai mentioned that the former police chief had cooperated with investigators from the beginning.
A further EUR 400 million for infrastructure
János Veres, Minister of Finance, and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three loan agreements worth a total of EUR 400 million in Budapest on Friday for education, transport and environmental infrastructure and the energy sector.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental projects implemented with grants from the Cohesion Fund. The EUR 100 million loan agreement was signed earlier and the current agreement covers the use of the EUR 200 million lent.
The sum of €150 million agreed in the loan contract will also be used for the budgetary financing of education projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary for this purpose; the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later in the context of the extension of the loan agreement.
In the field of innovation, the parties have signed an agreement for EUR 50 million, which will mainly go to research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
Subway line 4 was also discussed at the meeting.
It was agreed that once Hungary had clarified the details of the metro financing with the EU, the original contract and possible modifications would be discussed again.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary with a total value of EUR 8.4 billion.
The loan interest is linked to EURIBOR, the loan is provided by the EIB with a deferral of 8 years, free of commission.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - the whole of Europe is paying close attention to the previously rarely mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who is buying in what is still the cheapest market in the EU, but which is rapidly becoming more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re / Max Division.
Bulgaria is currently undoubtedly the most sought-after place for property purchases in Eastern Europe, with affordable ski apartments and houses by the sea.
Between the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa, Albena, the "Gold Coast," the "Sun Coast," and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar, but real estate around Kavarna and Balcik is also increasingly in demand.
According to the estimates of Re / Max analysts in Bulgaria, the interior of the country will sooner or later attract investors, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and the extremely favorable area of Ruse is also seeing more buyers.
The capital Sofia also offers tempting offers - commercial and office space offers the highest returns.
Bulgaria is well on its way to becoming one of the most attractive European golfers "paradise, attracting tourists not only in summer and winter but also in the other two seasons.
Forward-looking investors are therefore already shopping on a large scale, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people buying real estate in Bulgaria are also seeking to change their way of life.
The majority of buyers are English, but there are also interested parties from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while the Black Sea and ski resorts are predominantly Russian buyers.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgy Yankov, Regional Director of Re / Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle either buy revitalised properties for 50-100,000 euros, or run-down houses for 5-15,000 euros, which they then renovate themselves.
Good connections and accessibility as well as communication possibilities are very important, but also the proximity to a big city, shops and doctors are crucial for the buyers.
In the second category belong those who are looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed among the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group consists of businessmen who invest with the aim of adding value in the medium to long term.
Properties in the capital, meanwhile, are becoming more expensive all the time, driven by ever-growing demand.
Within the EU, property prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but over the past five years there has been an annual increase of 21 percent.
House price inflation far outstrips wage increases.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percent
As announced by Environment Minister Gábor Fodor, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will be continued by ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are discussing the Bali Roadmap, which sets out the emission reduction measures for the period after 2012, i.e. after the expiry of the Kyoto Protocol.
There is currently a heated debate going on between developed and developing countries.
The US has already signaled that it does not want to negotiate concrete figures, but it would be willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels.
The other big question at the conference is whether the industrialised countries are prepared to support the developing countries both financially and technologically in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement has also been reached on assistance to developing countries.
The Adaptation Fund under the Kyoto Protocol will be administered by a 16-member council, probably at the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), according to the "Piac és Profit."
Hungary's six percent
Environment Minister Gábor Fodor, speaking on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's ambition to maintain its leading role in global climate action and to reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (compared to 1990 levels), regardless of whether the "post-2012 agreement" is successful or not. Indeed, the Union would be ready to commit to a 30% reduction provided that other major industrialised countries of the world, or developing countries, are also prepared to fulfil their obligations in a strong and responsible manner.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the target of the countries that had acceded to the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2 percent, whereas the EU, with its 15 member states at the time, had already committed itself to a reduction of 8%.
The target for Hungary is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to 1985-87 - a target the country will certainly meet, according to the press release of the Ministry of Environment.
The stakes are high in Bali - after all, the long-term international climate agreement must be ready within two years, otherwise it would surely not enter into force until after 2012. In this case, the reduction plans laid down in the Kyoto Protocol would not be followed by another international emissions reduction scheme, the importance of which was also highlighted by the IPCC, the UN's Nobel Peace Prize-winning scientific climate change committee, in its latest report.
This would delay emission reductions and increase the Earth's average temperature by more than 2 ° C, with extremely serious and irreparable consequences, according to scientists.
British Army advertises on YouTube
British Army units have posted footage of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan on the video portal in a bid to boost its popularity.
First of all, the British Air Force (RAF) has discovered YouTube for itself: Special forces stationed in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of anti-Taliban operations online since March 2006, reports the BBC.
The footage, shot with miniature cameras attached to helmets, is checked at the Kandahar air base and then sent to London, where it is posted on the internet.
Political message inevitable
Air Force soldiers have already contributed 139 such recordings, and their "channel" has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered under "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 to publish videos about Iraqi and Afghan operations, but the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the International Peacekeeping Forces (MNFI) based in Iraq also have their own YouTube channels.
Operations in Afghanistan
The Air Force originally released the videos with the goal of recruiting soldiers, and the Defense Department says the posts also serve the purpose of informing the public about the actual goals of foreign deployments.
Defence expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC that propaganda of this kind is almost free of charge compared to traditional television commercials, but these videos always carry a certain degree of political message, because they confirm in their own way the raison d "être of the military measures adopted by the government.
Americans advertise with game
But the army must also fight against amateur recordings that, in addition to the carefully edited, censored recordings, also make it onto the net - such as those showing the deaths of soldiers: the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films only talk about the losses, but do not show the bloody sides of the war.
Incidentally, numerous videos shot in action have already been uploaded to the platform from the theatres of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, but the British have only recently discovered this "genre."
The Americans, however, advertise in a slightly different way, namely with the free downloadable shooting game "America's Army," in which the player can slip into the soldier's skin as part of a more or less lifelike simulation.
Christmas Party with Tombola and Pogache in the Ministries
Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth is by no means squeamish: instead of a Christmas party, she is organising a work conference at which her staff can round off the year 2007 with coffee and pogatsch.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, others conjure up the Christmas spirit with a raffle or a toast to the hearts of civil servants.
Party, Christmas spirit, concerts and buffet - that's how the power celebrates.
Christmas fever has already hit the offices.
The biggest Christmas party of any ministry this year will be held at the Ministry of Defence, but the ministry's staff are not expected to attend.
At the "Orphan Christmas Celebration," children are presented with gifts from fallen soldiers, at the "Mission Celebration," family members of soldiers currently stationed abroad are entertained, but there is also a reception for the press.
The department is allocating around 25 million euros for the festivities.
Compared to other portfolios, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport are over the top.
The 4.32 million forint Christmas party of the Ministry of Economy will be held in the House of the Future, about 350 of the 600 employees are expected.
While the focus of the festivities will be on Christmas, there will also be live acts and a raffle.
The National Agency for Development (NFÜ) held its 4.7 million forint Christmas party on Wednesday in the House of the National Council of Justice (OIT), with concerts and a banquet.
The hall rent amounted to 1 Mio Forint, the rest was spent for the more than 400 invited guests.
According to our information, a branch of NFÜ is also invited to another Christmas party organised by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) with EU funds.
The building of the Comedy Theatre ("Vígszínház") was rented for the celebration.
MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information, as we have not reached those responsible.
Why the suit?
The OIT building was open not only to NFÜ guests, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas party on 7 December.
They did not have to pay rent to the OIT to use the premises.
About 500 visitors came to the ball.
The festivities were opened with a speech by the Minister, after the dinner there was live music to dance.
When asked by [source], they said: 'There was no obligation on the ball to wear a ball gown or suit.'
The ministries of Health, Labour and Local Government are each preparing for a puritanical celebration.
The Ministry of Health organises the celebration for employees in their own homes for around 400,000 HUF.
Employment Minister Mónika Lamperth is not officially inviting her staff to a Christmas party, but to a conference at the end of the year.
According to the press department, about 180 guests are expected to be treated to coffee and pogatsche, so the celebration is expected to be 350,000 forints.
Self-Government Minister Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will simply toast in the auditorium of the ministry.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is hosting a Christmas party in its own ballroom, where 436 employees are expected to attend.
The expenditure was calculated at 2,500 forints per capita - for this money there is a buffet reception followed by a toast.
Since the beginning of the term of János Veres, the PM's staff celebrate in this way every year.
However, there will be no real party atmosphere - not only because of the official speech of the minister, but also because the party has been scheduled for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture is hosting a New Year's reception on 20 January, but the ministry's Christmas party is cancelled this time.
One hundred guests are invited to the Vajdahunyad Castle in the city park ("Városliget"); according to information provided by the resort, the expenditure is 1,000 forints per guest.
As reported by the press department, it will be a very simple reception to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
The receptions, which are held every year, traditionally begin with a short speech by the minister and end with a low-key feast.
As the corresponding press offices report on [origo] request, there will be no Christmas party at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the Ministry of Education.
When asked about the costs of the Christmas party, the press department of the Ministry of the Environment could not provide any information.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the celebration, which is being held in the Museum of Applied Arts.
More and more forces mobilized for giant strike
The League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Trade Union Federation will form their coordinating committee on Friday for the indefinite strike starting on Monday.
A large protest meeting will be held on Saturday, and on Monday - the day of the referendum on the health insurance law - the work stoppage will begin.
Considerable disruption is expected due to strikes, as rail services are almost completely suspended, and Budapest's public transport companies (BKV) are also on strike until 1 p.m.
Details of Monday's strike will be jointly announced by the league and the union federation on Friday afternoon.
A LIGA - MOSZ strike committee will also be established, which will be responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
A large protest meeting will be held on Saturday and, from Monday, all organisations that have joined the strike will cease work indefinitely unless an agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike that began on the day of the parliamentary vote on the health insurance law was not defined.
If the National Council does not adopt the Health Insurance Act, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for a strike.
However, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet to discuss how to proceed.
Due to the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even conceivable that the vote on the health insurance law will not take place until later in the evening, or even at midnight.
The strikes, which will begin on Monday, will cause significant disruption to services: the railway workers will be suspended indefinitely, and in the morning the majority of public transport and more than half of Volán companies will be shut down.
At the same time, there will be one-way motorway closures in many places.
The call for a strike has been followed by numerous unions and civil organizations - the list of participants is updated regularly on the league's website.
Some organisations have announced strikes for an indefinite period, while others are planning temporary stoppages.
Until Thursday afternoon, no agreement could be reached between the Hungarian Railways MÁV and the Free Union of Railway Workers VDSZSZ on adequate services, even though more and more people travel by train around the Christmas holidays.
According to reports so far, strikes are taking place at BKV from the start of operations until 1 p.m., at Budapest Airport between 7 and 9 a.m., the LIGA unions for electricity and heat energy are suspending their work for four hours, and the teachers "union and the Democratic Union of Teachers have called for 2 and 2-8 hours strikes respectively.
The Hungarian Medical Association is on strike at different times throughout the country, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers, a sub-organisation of the SZEF, the Forum for Trade Union Cooperation, is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points demanded by the League is that the government withdraw the health insurance reform bill and propose a new conception of social discourse.
The second demand concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which is due from next year.
Demand number three is that beneficiaries should be able to access the early retirement system before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZSZ, which belongs to the League of Trade Unions, did not accept the offer made by the Ministry of Transport concerning the secondary lines and is now calling for a new approach.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increases sovereign risk
According to Political Capital's Risk Analysis Division, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, created this August with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary, have increased the risk to Hungary and the region in several respects.
Among other things, the Institute's "Risk Warning Report" states that, in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is the "aggravation of the already existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy populations in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic conflicts in the short term."
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which presumably aims at provoking such a confrontation, according to the research institute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure on the part of political leaders: "Public figures have left the discussion of the Roma question to representatives of radical political groups, who have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungary conflict."
It is thought that this would exacerbate the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, encourage extremism, and increase the likelihood of violent confrontations.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard have "significantly damaged Hungary's image abroad, especially in terms of confidence in stability and democratic maturity," not least thanks to the enormous attention from the domestic and foreign media.
We remember that since autumn 2006, the reorganization of radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary has been on a steady upswing, so that since summer 2007 several organizations calling themselves the "National Self-Defense Association" have been founded.
"What these groups have in common is that they each define themselves as a civil organisation, while openly bragging about preparing their members for - sometimes armed - defence tasks (civil protection, national defence, law and order), citing the unfitness of the police, the army or the state itself," it said.
Furthermore, all this is done according to the method which attempts to disguise as a bourgeois initiative various political aspirations based on the political and party disillusionment of the population.
The emphasis on the civil character and the form of the association does not only serve to circumvent the legal hurdles that may arise in the course of registration with the court - it is also a political strategy.
As the analysis shows, the activities of the Hungarian Guard also constitute a risk-enhancing factor for relations with neighbouring states.
In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring states, and some ultra-nationalist politicians in certain neighbouring countries see the emergence of the Hungarian Guard as confirmation of their own anti-Hungary policy.
All this has an impact on the political stability of the region, "it said.
From the point of view of the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central-Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the entire region has increased.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose creation was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the emergence of the Bulgarian Guard were the mass Roma evictions, which took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Polyana).
The BNU immediately took the events as the reason for the creation of the National Guard, arguing that the goal of the organization was "national protection."
According to them, a real "gypsy terror" has been noticeable in Bulgaria over the past 17 years, but the state has remained inactive and indifferent - according to Political Capital.
Furthermore, the initiative would have triggered a fierce debate among the Bulgarian public.
As I said, the increased risk of ethnic clashes is also demonstrated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced that they will set up their own guard for resistance purposes.
As the activities of the Hungarian Guard so far show many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that the Hungarian Roma will also respond to the threats by organising their own protection, according to the risk warning report of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, research director at Political Capital, said when asked by the news outlet: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Annual risk analysis reports would be published, and if risk-changing trends were to become apparent, public opinion would be informed, as in the case of the Risk Alert Report.
Holidays are not holidays everywhere
In Hungary, public holidays are strictly regulated by law, so the practice of rescheduling working days around public holidays has now become established, but the coming year will bring us fewer such days.
In the EU and America, too, "holiday" is a different term.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between public holidays and non-working days.
Days off work are usually church holidays, or are associated with important historical events.
For example, we also celebrate the New Year: both the last day of the old year and the first day of the new year are work-free days - the latter alone so that New Year's Eve revellers can rest.
Throughout the year we have a total of fourteen public holidays.
The national holidays are 15 March, which commemorates the revolution of 1848, and 23 October, which commemorates the revolution of 1956.
On 20 August the founding of the state will be celebrated, on 1 May work will be celebrated, and on 1 and 2 November we will commemorate our dead.
In addition, there are two public holidays each at Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our state, national, or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of "shifting the working day" has proven effective in cases where we would work only one day before or after the holiday.
The price of the long weekends, however, is that we have to work or go to school on the Saturdays before that.
When this day, which falls before or after the public holiday, should finally be processed has been determined for many years by the Minister of Labour in a separate regulation.
The legislation applies to all employers and employees, public employees and civil servants alike.
Only companies and institutions in which operations continue without interruption, including on public holidays, are excluded.
This year, the working regulations are only a little confused by the holidays at the end of the year: From December 24, life in this country will come to a virtual standstill, as most people take time off for the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve, or the holiday that has been specially reserved for them.
Next year, there will be more public holidays in the middle of the week or at the end of the week, so there will be less rescheduling of working days than this year.
The calendar is first "turned upside down" around Labor Day, so that people can stay at home for four days at a time.
Saturday 26 April will be a working day, so that Friday 2 May will be a day of rest.
The second rescheduling is related to the public holiday on 23 October: on Saturday 18 October, it will be necessary to work through Friday 24 October in advance.
The end of the year, however, will be completely dominated by the holidays, as from 24 December everything will stand still, even if New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six chilling little things to annoy work colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive - harmless lies that we no longer notice: they bring "color" to everyday life at the workplace.
The only question is whether one gets used to these small inconveniences, or one better rises to the challenge and tries to consciously avoid these ambiguous, for other annoying situations.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone from the marketing department called" - says a colleague.
That you missed a meeting as a result?
At best, you regret it and try to make amends by perhaps calling the marketing department and confessing remorsefully that you forgot to deliver the message (this is the less common method).
More often than not, the matter is dismissed with an apology.
Before you become embroiled in embarrassing excuses, consider how you can cause your colleagues truly unpleasant moments and try to consciously avoid these situations.
Something borrowed that doesn't belong to you?
There's hardly anything more annoying than reaching for a document, office supplies, or phone, but it's not there.
Yesterday the stapler was still on the desk - is it gone this morning?
Or is the lost ballpoint pen discovered on a colleague's desk?
We should not borrow anything from colleagues without asking questions, because they are right to be angry when they see that something has gone wrong.
So, don't put envelopes or Post-it notes from the office in your pocket, because it could hit you: no more when you really need them.
Gossip about colleagues "private lives?
There is no effective means of stopping a gossip that has already been put into the world.
Who did what with whom?
Where and why?
If possible, one should not bind the information (or assumptions) about the private lives of colleagues to the nose of everyone!
And if someone does open up and reveal his innermost secret to us, we should not abuse this trust!
It is best to be silent like a grave, rather than aligning those who are not present, even if others know about your colleague's problems.
Reported ill for no reason?
When you call the office to report that you are ill, citing excruciating headaches, because you are feeling unwell, or just want to rest, you should be clear about one thing: your own work, non-postponable tasks, projects with fixed deadlines must now be done by your colleagues instead of yourself.
So don't hold your colleagues in contempt!
If you know the day before that you won't make it to the office the next day, or that something might happen in between so you have to stay at home, you should report it in good time so that neither your colleagues nor your boss are unexpectedly confronted with your absence.
Giggling, Phone, Phone
You are immersed in your work, but are you suddenly disturbed by the loud giggles of your colleagues?
Inadvertently overheard a phone conversation that should not have been heard?
One should not annoy colleagues with buzzing, singing, loud conversations (which one leads over their heads), stomping, constant cursing or grumbling.
All this can be very disturbing, even if they are not engrossed in a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Is it always the other's fault?
If a project is not completed on time, if you forgot to send an important letter or important news, you should not blame others for your forgetfulness!
If possible, one should not make excuses for the chaos in the office or the noisy colleagues!
It is best to acknowledge your mistakes and apologise if others have been affected!
The question of how to make up for the mistake, or how to make up for the omission, is all too pertinent!
In the office - a feeling like at home?
Tracksuit bottoms and slippers: Comfortable at home, but has lost nothing in the office!
Not even then should one dress so casually, if the workplace would actually allow it!
Just don't get too sloppy - you should respect your colleagues as well as yourself to the extent that you dress appropriately in the office - if desired, also pretty and elegant!
Want to do it for everyone - or how to become uninteresting to others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the morning traffic jam.
A strange melody rings out from the radio: the sound of a violin paired with electronic effects.
I turn up the volume.
The tempo changes, the bass is added to the previous sounds, and a female choir is a real sonic jewel.
It is the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar, which is played on mr2.
The local music scene has not spoiled us with quality electropop for a long time.
But now you even see the traffic jam differently when listening to Zagar's new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, many new and exciting productions from the local digital underground scene slowly contribute to a change in the overall picture, and even if garage rock with its guitar squeal is "in" again, the domestic electropop proves: there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started out in Pécs, playing in the band Yonderboi himself, before embarking on his own path - perhaps because an inn cannot tolerate two pipers.
His breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which fuses elements of jazz, electronic and pop, was only achieved when he was approached with the request to compose the soundtrack for a film (e.g.
"Szezon" by Ferenc Török).
The formation, which had initially appeared in smaller clubs, only became known to the wider public when the magazine "wan2" ranked their first album from 2002 among the top 50 domestic albums and named Zagar, together with Yonderboi, almost the only trendsetter marketable in the West.
Undoubtedly, Zagar and his band were "trendy," but no one cared if they liked to wear this brand.
The band reacted as it should: with a new, even better album.
The new album "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open up new avenues for them, but the title itself expresses a desire for continuity with the Pécs years.
The term comes from the time when Balázs Zságer was still on the road with another band.
The airy, flying allusion would be fine, but apart from the ethereal character of the music, the louder guitar - in keeping with the zeitgeist and trends - and the influences of rock'n'roll are noticeable.
The singer György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle," introduced himself with these songs at the premiere at Millenáris.
One song from the album even made it to the radio hit - the mr2 Petőfi, which broadcasts pop music from early to late, successively catches the listeners "eye with the number" Wings of Love, "which was recorded with the participation of six local singers (" Underground Divas ").
All right then (?).
The hvg.hu has contacted Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent does your music remain the preserve of a certain layer?
Balázs Zságer: The term "stratified music" doesn't really mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two castes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative or underground music can be shallow and meaningless, but they can also only be produced for sale, which makes them commercial music.
Even a good pop number can come from an honest motive.
The receptivity of the listener also works according to this principle, independent of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences towards your music?
For example: In foreign countries, especially in the west of us, pop music has a larger tradition.
Not only teenagers or Twens go to concerts, but also the older audience.
They pay much more attention to the trends in pop music that are happening around them, because they also consider them to be part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Is it important who, where, how many people listen to your music?
B. Zs.: Of course it is a good feeling to see that more and more people come to our concerts.
But we never composed for the market.
For us, music is not created to serve a purpose, but for a specific reason.
The role of the audience is mostly noticeable at the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but this in turn only exists in the intangible changes of the moment.
Nevertheless, one thing struck me: If you want to please everyone, you are no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far would you like to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is on the road as a soloist and has rather built his career in the West.
E.g.: We don't really go his way, apart from the fact that we always try to interpret this into our music.
We see ourselves rather as team players who trust in the musical presence of the other and let it unfold.
In the beginning, of course, comparisons between our work and that of Yonderboi were inevitable, as several of us came from his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Petőfi, "Wings of Love" comes first.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening deliberately staged with a slightly more popular style in the direction of a wider audience?
E.g.: We had no plans to write a hit, which should then serve as a driving force for the album.
This song is about more than that.
It was meant to be the finale of the album, with which we wanted to resolve the orgy of sounds and the somewhat more difficult themes.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why them, what was the guiding principle?
E.g.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea to compose the choir from talented soloists from the local music scene.
This is how the six-member choir was created - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then christened "Underground Divas."
hvg.hu: Did you want to have the song in the same way, or did the girls co-design it?
E.g.: The number has been in the instrumental version for some time, but when the material for the album was ready, we thought that this number "needs something."
The sequence of chords called for a vocal part.
I sang the melody the same night, later they learned the girls.
It all came practically straight away and frighteningly spontaneous.
I remember I was quite electrified at the time, but it took the "divas."
With my voice alone, the song would never have become so powerful.
hvg.hu: But on the record as well as at the concert one had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo part (apart from Judy Jay's short solo), they have no role of their own, sing together perfectly and are no louder than the music, so their singing is not just accompanied by the music.
They also stood at the back of the stage.
Is it intentional?
B.Zs.: The fact that they stood at the back was because of purely technical problems.
However, we deliberately did not want to give them solo roles.
The number is also about forgetting one's ego a little bit, forgetting who has come from where and where, we simply allow these particular wings, the wings of love, to lift us up.
I would like others to feel the euphoric state that we felt when the song was written.
hvg.hu: Which was the most elaborate song?
For example: In the case of musical creativity, actually none at all, there have been rather more difficult tasks in mixing.
For example in "Dorian Gray's Dilemma," in which I play a concert piano, or in "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls," where the groove didn't want to work any longer, but little by little everything came together, like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favourite number from the new album?
E.g.: That constantly changes with the concerts and even now that I have "let go" of the album.
Currently it's "Prophet Is A Fool," "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same."
Fraudulent estate agent risked billions for inferiority
Bottomless cheat
This is what the French banking giant Société Générale, owner of Komerční banka, calls its former employee Jerome Kerviel.
It was because of him that it lost almost EUR 5 billion.
It seems more likely, however, that Kerviel was just a great player who wanted to do the same as his colleagues, but was certainly not incapable.
Unlike all major banks, he recognized the crisis in the American mortgage market in good time.
"He is rather weak mentally," could be heard from the mouth of his superiors, who reported him to the police.
However, as can be seen from Kerviel's statements, published by the French media, such as the daily newspaper Le Monde, he was a man who, at the end of last year, made a profit of EUR 1.6 billion from his businesses.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he claims in his statement.
In the summer, he managed to earn half a billion euros from the American crisis in particular.
He had already spotted the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
Back in February, there was initial news that so-called sub-prime mortgages, given to low-income customers or those who had previous payment problems, would be in trouble.
But this crisis should not have an impact on the entire economy.
Kerviel did not believe it and was proved right.
At the end of the year, it had raised its profit to 1.6 billion euros.
"Even when I made the first half a billion, I didn't know how to explain it," Kerviel admits, adding that he definitely didn't keep anything to himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he admits that he falsified documents to avoid being caught.
He even managed to deceive his bosses, even though the Eurex Exchange gradually became interested in his business.
Risk profiles
Was he afraid to fly?
Hardly.
'I thought it was satisfying the simple fact that I'd made £1.6 billion for the bank. '
Where did he get the courage to risk so much?
He had to work out his position step by step.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
After two years he was already an assistant to a real estate agent and in 2005 he became a freelance real estate agent with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew he would never earn as much as others.
"I knew from my first conversation in 2005 that I was being watched.
Because of my education and also because of my professional and personal development, "Kerviel told investigators.
But soon after he joined, the first great success came.
He made a lot of money from Allianz's shares by betting half a billion euros on its share price falling in the London bombings.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you make a profit, we will let you
"It's like a snowball," he told police.
But the bosses supposedly knew, or suspected, everything.
'As long as I was making money, they'd shut their eyes. '
But then came the big blow earlier this year.
In a single day, he lost one billion euros.
One weekend in mid-January, he wanted to make up for that.
By the time he got to work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros because of him.
And how did they come to him?
He made himself suspicious by taking a holiday.
'I've only taken four days off from the previous year.
A real estate agent who doesn't take a vacation is one who doesn't want you to look at his cards, "Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic has a chance to reach 365 billion
Czech ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed yesterday a total of nine development programmes, through which the Czech Republic will be able to reach 14 billion euros (about 365 billion crowns) over the next few years.
This is about half the amount that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Approximately 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive approximately 100 billion crowns under the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
Most of the money, about 150 billion, will go to transport expansion.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and comprises up to 22% of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the fund.
This money correspondingly increases the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have 90.8 billion next year.
The "Enterprise and Innovation" programme aims to help entrepreneurs and firms attract funds for innovative ventures.
The aim is to attract finance for the introduction of new technologies, for business research, but also for the introduction of more effective organisational methods.
The Czech Republic has so far been one of the least successful of the new accession countries in terms of acquiring funds from EU funds.
Nicaraguan court upholds 20-year prison sentence for ex-president
An appeals court in Nicaragua on Thursday upheld the 20-year prison sentence handed down to former President Arnold Alemán in 2003 for financial fraud amounting to 100 million dollars (almost 1.8 billion kroner).
But he was later released from prison and lived under house arrest on his hacienda near the Nicaraguan metropolis.
Whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state will return to prison is currently unclear, according to the AP news agency.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will now depend on the prison officers whether Alemán is allowed to serve his sentence at home or whether he has to go to prison.
A court found four years ago that Alemán had routinely moved government money into accounts held by foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious, and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest supporters.
Some of that money ended up in a fund set up by Alemán to finance his 2001 election campaign.
Budget is through
Yes, it's done.
The state budget has been approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget this government has drafted, and it was passed without the support of the opposition by the coalition majority.
The one for the current year was approved with the support of the ČSSD (social democrats), because Minister Sobotka (from that party) had presented it, and the ČSSD could therefore not afford to reject it.
Unlike the lively debate that preceded the vote on the motion of censure against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Representatives quietly approved this traditionally little-noticed, yet highly significant, law.
This is somewhat paradoxical.
All governance begins and ends with the individual chapters and items of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is obscured by the power struggle between the government and the opposition.
This is a more rewarding subject for the media, which is why they pay more attention to it.
An argument among politicians is much more interesting to the public than sober numbers.
Under previous social democratic governments, state budgets suffered from three weak points, which the budget for 2008 cannot remedy all at once:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure that is legally obligatory, not only pensions, but also social expenditure, which was decided by the "tacit" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (communists) last year before the elections.
The second is deficit budgetary policy as a consequence of the first weakness.
The third constraint is public finance deficits, i.e. municipal budget deficits.
The biggest risk, however, is not the government budget deficit.
This budget is public and reasonably under control.
A real time bomb, however, is the municipal budget deficit.
Many mayors, in order to tap other sources of investment besides income from taxes, levies, and bank loans, often unwittingly issued bonds that left their town halls in excessive debt.
In recent years, they have been able to repay this debt by selling en masse shares in energy and other utilities that they received from the state in the course of privatization.
Now that source has already dried up.
Insofar as we adhere only to official and verifiable facts, we note that:
For several years now, our economy, like the rest of the world, has been going through a period of growth of which the ČSSD prides itself ceaselessly.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to put their public finances in order.
Instead, these governments owed the state even more.
Other countries, with a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more sensibly than our republic.
This is a huge disgrace, largely attributable to the previous governments.
We are one of the countries that are least at risk of poverty on a global scale.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes, which, unfortunately, have been unnecessarily inflated on a gigantic scale in recent years.
Although we have managed to eliminate some of the nonsensical populist expenditure adopted this year before the elections, it is clear that unless there is a postponement of the retirement age and pension reform in the near future, practically all politics in this country will end and, whoever is in power, he will be left with nothing but pure administration.
It is only a slight exaggeration to say that ruling politicians then become civil servants who mechanically allocate most of the tax revenue to pensions and social expenditure.
This is why this year's budget cannot be a revolution; it can only stop ordinary expenditure being squeezed out by compulsory expenditure.
The deficit of SEK 70 billion planned for 2008 would be superfluous if previous governments had not spent what they could in the last ten years.
If we do not really want ruling politicians to become mere administrative officials, then we must be patient and wish this not too strong coalition government, which is aware, however, that the state can only spend as much as it is able to collect in taxes and fees, peace of mind as it prepares further reform legislation.
Only these will allow a gradual implementation of a balanced state budget.
Jiri Krejci
Banks to tackle crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis in the financial markets.
More than $100 billion will enter the currency markets through auctions.
At these auctions, banks are auctioning off interest rates at which they are willing to lend to each other.
For example, the US Fed is auctioning off $40 billion, with the European and Swiss central banks loosening another 24.
It is the first time since the attacks of 11 September that the central banks of individual states have agreed on such a coordinated approach to avert or mitigate the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This move is designed to address the economy's biggest difficulties, namely the growing shortage of freely available capital that banks can lend," Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group wrote in a report for his clients.
"Coordinated central bank action has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the US from 65% to about 50%," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion because of unserviced loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further losses of billions.
"" The central banks must have been really afraid of what else might follow when they decided to do this, "" said ABN Amro chief economist Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he said.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves have difficulty accessing bonds, loans will become more expensive for their customers.
That would reduce consumption and plunge the American economy into recession, possibly with repercussions for economic growth around the world.
The central banks decided to do so after failing to lower the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank rate used to lend money between banks.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to lend to each other, despite the fact that the central banks of the US, Canada, and the United Kingdom had cut their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"This will have the same effect as another rate cut," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this move by central banks is contributing to the heat of the crisis, because it does not solve the fundamental problem, which is the fall in the US housing market.
Klaus: Debates of ecologists are unbelievable
Global climate change is said to be hurting developing countries the most.
President Václav Klaus spoke again on the issue of global warming.
The criticism was now directed at the UN's international conference on climate change in Bali, which is drawing to a close.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A blue planet, not a green planet," he said that the debates of ecologists were unbelievable.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which is a strange mixture of government officials and non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a firework of words that is only a substitute for a real solution to current problems," Klaus said.
At the presentation of his book, the Czech President emphasized that the topic is very important to him and that is why he is so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appeared in German translation, because "I often come across caricatures of my views."
So now prospective customers can read his attitude unbiased.
Klaus pointed out that he was not a climatologist, but he believed that he had sufficient qualifications to write such a book.
He is, after all, an academic, able to understand and judge technical treatises, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
The main thrust of the book is that the climate is constantly changing, and that its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consensus among scientists on global warming, that the consequences of the current changes are not too great and serious, and therefore do not pose a threat, and that efforts to influence the development of the climate are superfluous, ineffective, and unacceptably costly.
Furthermore, as someone with experience of totalitarian systems, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven views on others; he considers this to be a dangerous restriction of freedom.
In response to questions from those present, he repeatedly stated that he was not against "sensible environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who take no account of the relationship between effort and yield."
Klaus had already spoken about the same topic two months ago in Vienna at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people failed to change their driving licences
600,000 motorists missed the deadline to exchange their old licence, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when you can apply for an exchange so that the authorities can issue a new driving licence by the end of the year.
But the ministry does not fear that hundreds of thousands of drivers without valid driving licenses will take to the roads after the New Year.
According to the authorities, it is mainly those who no longer want to drive who have not changed their driving licences.
While small towns have reported a sharp drop in interest in the exchange, the capital's offices have been inundated with applications, and interest in the exchange grew this week.
The municipality handles around 2000 customers every day.
You have to queue for about half an hour.
In Prague, around 140,000 drivers have not yet exchanged their driving licences.
Issuing a new driving licence takes 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shortened period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver will have to pay 500 kroner.
Motorists who fail to make the required change by the end of the year and drive without a valid driving licence will face a fine from January.
The culprit pays a maximum of 2000 kronor.
However, the police can leave it at the transgression also with a reprimand.
In case of transgression, the penalty can rise to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, even those who do not drive at all can be fined by the municipality.
He could, it was said, face a fine of as much as 30,000 kronor.
The ministry has already called on the authorities to show leniency and impose a maximum fine of 1000 kronor.
According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, no one is threatened with a thousand crowns fine.
The driving licence is a document in which everyone can decide whether or not to possess it.
It is not an identity card that everyone, and a valid one at that, must have.
People who no longer want to drive should surrender their driving licence.
It is sufficient to take him to the competent municipal office or to send him there by registered mail.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will become invalid.
Drivers will also gradually have to change other types of driving licences.
People with driving licences from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to exchange them.
Driving licences issued between 2001 and 2004 will expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this involves about 2.6 million additional driving licences.
Court cuts sentences for detectives who were allied with Berdych
Former policemen Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, accused of colluding with the gang of David Berdych, received 13 and 10 years in prison respectively.
This was decided in a final judgment by the Prague Higher Regional Court, which reduced her sentence by one year and two years respectively.
Initially, the detectives from the Office for the Fight against Organised Crime were given 14 and 12 years respectively.
Today's ruling cannot be appealed, only an appeal to the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself has also been charged in the case, but is yet to be sentenced.
At other trials, however, he had already received sentences totaling 16 years.
He cannot be sentenced to anything more.
A district court found 19 people guilty in January, mainly for involvement in robberies, and the Higher Regional Court heard the appeal of 16 of them today.
Most of the accused denied the charges from the outset on the grounds that it was a fabricated case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, in consultation with, among others, Berdych, members of the police handed criminals information from police sources, covered up various robberies and helped members of the gang evade prosecution.
The gang left 30 per cent of the loot to Opava and Koňařík.
The charges relate to offences committed by the gang between 1999 and 2001.
In particular, robberies, the victims of which often suffered serious injuries, but also presumption of office and illegal possession of weapons.
During house searches, police discovered illegal pistols, ammunition with a steel core, a laser scope and a submachine gun.
According to the indictment, the gang has enriched itself with many millions of crowns through their robberies.
In addition to nearly 20 men in the case, courts found Berdych and a number of others guilty of other robberies.
More men from Berdych's entourage are due to stand trial in a different trial, with other cases yet to come to court.
So far, Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish custody awaiting a final decision on their extradition for prosecution in the Czech Republic, have escaped the main hearing.
Children swapped - invoice: 12 million
Igor Veleba, lawyer for the injured parents, wants to demand 12 million crowns in compensation plus court costs from the hospital in Třebíč for the exchange of children in a maternity clinic.
For each of the mothers three million, for the fathers two million and for the children one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each pair of parents.
Therefore, the legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, does not agree at all with Veleba's proposal.
"We reject such a proposal, it is many times too high," said Dostál after today's hearing.
"However, in order to be able to form an opinion on this counter-proposal, we need the expert opinion that the opposing party had prepared.
We will see if it has any value at all.
But we insist that it should be in the hundreds of thousands for everyone, "Dostál said.
According to him, the amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 kroner for each of the four parents.
In the beginning, the family from Jabloňov wanted one million crowns for each month they did not raise their biological daughter.
Veleba's compensation negotiations were based on an expert report prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague Motol.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, the parents of the children suffered psychological damage and stress symptoms of varying degrees and depth.
The men tolerated the stress situation better, even if they faced accusations that they could have prevented the confusion of the newborns.
The women, on the other hand, are less able to cope with the after-effects of the trauma they have experienced, as well as with what is happening now, Veleba summarized the content.
Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses from the maternity hospital in Třebíč on 9 December last year.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov.
At the end of October, the Regional Governor of Vysočina (Bohemian-Moravian Heights) handed over 100,000 crowns to each family as compensation for expenses incurred as a result of the mistake of the hospital in Třebíč, which is under the authority of the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally covered by liability insurance.
If in doubt, they will have to resort to a reserve fund, but only in exceptional cases can they apply for assistance from the institution.
The courts have so far awarded comparatively small amounts of damages to those affected, the amounts have been determined by spreadsheets and have ranged in the hundreds of thousands, exceptionally by millions.
Polívka lost his kingdom of Wallachia
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the trademark "Kingdom of Wallachia."
According to the judge at the District Court in Ostrava, although he was the first to use the name "Wallachian King," the project had been built up over many years by a team led by Tomáš Harabiš in collaboration with the actor.
Polívka did not attend the hearing today.
But according to his lawyer, the case is unlikely to end there and his client is likely to appeal.
"The dispute is about the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team want to share in the popularity of Bolek Polívka," Polívka's lawyer said after the hearing.
Everyone imagined the actor and comedian with the words "Wallachian Kingdom."
Harabiš agrees.
"We have been working for almost ten years.
fundraising and concepts of activities, "he said.
According to him, the cause is dispute over money.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful and that they could benefit from it.
They want to be part of our work, "he said.
Profitable business
According to the court, Polívka used the term "Wallachian King" for the first time in one of his television programmes.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
But at the time this had nothing to do with the intention of establishing a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing Wallachian passports.
What was originally a fun event turned into a business and entrepreneurial activity, which was followed by the establishment of the Wallachian Kingdom.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to the use of his name and signature in the passports and even offered their owners discounts on visits to his farm and his theatrical performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also stated today that Harabiš used only the very idea that Polívka made public in the programme "Manege" for his entrepreneurial intentions.
"The popularity of Polívka certainly helped the project of the Wallachian Kingdom," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the project is Harabiš and his team, who have dedicated themselves intensively to it.
Cooperation between the parties at odds today lasted until 2000, when Harabiš organised the official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, disputes between Polívka and Harabiš began to mount, culminating in the deposition of "King Boleslav I elected to the day of the saint."
At the suggestion of Harabiss Jarmila Šuláková, the Queen Mother assumed the leading role.
In 2002, Polívka filed a lawsuit against Harabiš and his company, which the Court today dismissed.
The contest for the throne and half a princess prepared by Harabiš could bring clarity to the dispute.
A new king was to emerge from this.
He did not want to reveal details or a date.
'We don't want to rush anything.
It was to be something like the royal procession in Wallachia.
The king should be elected for a certain period of time.
Mr Polívka can also register, "added Harabiš.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Advance parts dwindle
To tell the truth, I've never been a particular fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not worth much, the quality of the gearshift, the steering and also the workmanship could be described as rather below average.
But now its successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and it is much better.
The station wagon with the designation SW is still a bit further, and I only have to revise my opinion.
When I tested the classic hatchback of the 207, for example, I had to complain about the lack of headroom in the rear seats.
These complaints no longer exist, because the body of the station wagon is designed in such a way that not even two-metre men will suffer.

I only go through the interior for a short time so as not to repeat myself too much.
It is a quite successful design, where I have objections only because of the meagre central tunnel.
I would like to see a bit more design where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and the days of complaining about seats or head restraints being too short are over.
The side support has also improved considerably compared to the 206.
As far as the space is concerned, you can feel the increased dimensions of the body here as well.
The aforementioned lack of headroom is also eliminated in the station wagon.
Suitcase in the trunk
The main thing about this car, however, is the cargo space.
I have to describe it (also because of the hinged rear window) as very well loadable and space-saving.
The cavities are equipped with restraints, which are an ideal compromise.
They do not disturb, can be pulled apart and hold even heavier objects.
But let's talk about the loading volume.
According to the table in the basic equipment, it is 428 litres, which is a rather average value compared to the competition.
However, not in comparison to the best-selling car in this class in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we notice that the Peugeot lags significantly behind by 52 litres.
This value is already critical for a holiday abroad or when loading a pram.
But in order to emphasize the positives, I have to mention the completely flat cargo space after folding the rear seats or also the very low loading edge.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder 1.6-litre petrol engine with an output of 88 kWp.
And frankly, that's what a 1600-cubic-cubic-inch engine should look like, powering a family hatchback.
It is quiet, has a low consumption and moves well.
When I compare him to his counterpart at Škoda, who sometimes looks as if his exhaust is clogged with a rag, I can only be delighted with him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not very popular.
However, we must remember that we have tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 petrol engine in the amount of 329900 crowns still goes on.
With our engine it costs from 410900 crowns, which is quite a lot.
The Premium equipment of the test car adds another 80000 crowns to the bill.
We did, however, have head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic windscreen wiper deployment, rear electric windows and and...
So the car costs a simple 531900 kroner in total.
That is a lot, but add up the additional equipment of a Fabia and you will arrive at a very similar sum.
All that remains is to decide which brand to choose.
Integration of Slovak pupils in UK schools fails
British schools are seeing an increase in the number of children from Eastern European countries, raising fears among locals about the future development of the local education system.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has so far encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools are even seeing cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants are increasing in violence.
The problem of integrating children from Eastern Europe into British schools is aptly illustrated by the case of North Kent, where disputes between locals and Slovak immigrants are gradually increasing.
Squabbles, bullying and scuffles among pupils have spread to relationships between parents.
The situation has already developed to the point where police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron bar.
The defendant defended herself by claiming the boy had insulted her with racist abuse.
Police also had to intervene after an attack by two underage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls allegedly made racist remarks towards the man and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a boy climbed onto a bus shelter and spat on us.
When I told him to stop, he threw apples and pears at us and then bared his buttocks, "a mother of Slovak students described another unpleasant incident to The Times newspaper.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even described the dispute with the immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases cited show that the atmosphere between locals and immigrants in British schools is becoming increasingly tense.
There are 70,000 Slovaks registered in the UK who have come here looking for work.
Around 30,000 Slovak pupils attend UK schools.
Cuba - most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors, it really is an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, it will come true if you only choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a calm sea like a pond.
Palm trees and all inclusive with waiters serving pizza, ice cream and beguiling cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find this in abundance.
But there is only one island where you will find much more, and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Greater Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place ever seen by a human eye.
Havana was once a warehouse or transit camp of treasures that the Spaniards had looted in America and then transported to Europe.
And then came the American epoch.
The Hotel Nacional was founded at the end of the 20th century.
It was built by one of the heads of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the USA (especially during Prohibition) was welcomed and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were:
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, skyscrapers grew, and the wide boulevards were crossed by cars, which were among the cult symbols of the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, stars of showbusiness and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
You can also leave your autograph on the walls of the Havana Bodeguita.
At the bar of the Hotel Nacional, cocktails can be mixed to your liking.
And the cult cars of the fifties still drive around Havana today, because the once imported schigulis and fiats have long since fallen apart in the salty and humid air.
Havana, especially its oldest part, may have been very run-down, nowhere in the vicinity you will find so many wonderful colonial sights as just here.
Other places are being cleaned up, such as Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism brings much-needed money, this development has been given the green light.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have sprung up not only in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín, and also on islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a quirk that is unique in the world and especially attracts railway lovers.
Sugar cane from remote plantations brought narrow-gauge steam and diesel trains to the sugar factories.
Their fleet has not been renewed for decades, and so you can see cute and fully functioning locomotives, whose contemporaries have long since been in the museum elsewhere.

The majority of visitors to Cuba do not miss the most important places.
You don't have to write about Varadero or Havana in detail anymore.
It is worth mentioning that the aforementioned Hemingway estate houses a museum, which should not be missed by anyone who likes this writer.
The Viñales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The lush vegetation grows on limestone soil.
The Mogotas, limestone hills and rocks, rise steeply from the valley floor, and fertile soil accumulates in their cavities, through which even weathered rock areas are covered by dense vegetation.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can meet it when you visit one of Havana's cigar factories.
It may also seem interesting to some that the Chilean episode of the television series "Major Zeman" was shot there.
Trinidad
An ancient city founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
The trade in slaves and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
The wealth was embodied in the pretty beauty of the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, situated between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is such a remote place that even in the 1950s there was no road connecting the area to the rest of the country.
This isolation contributed to the fact that it went unnoticed.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing was demolished, everyone was happy that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than an afternoon in Trinidad, it is worth visiting interesting places in the area, such as Playa Ancon beach or the Valley of the Sugar Factories.
In the evening, one should then go to the Casa de la Música, which comes alive after dark, and where the music is not silent until the morning.
Baracoa
This small town in the far east of Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful on the island.
Surely this view is also influenced by the way there.
Both roads leading from Guantánamo have to cross high and rugged mountains and run through a landscape barely touched by human intervention.
Thanks to the unspoilt nature there, UNESCO included this eastern outpost of Cuba in its World Heritage List.
This is where the best chocolate is made, where the cross of Columbus is displayed in the church (in fact, it was made about a hundred years after Columbus sailed), and from the hill where the former castle, now the Hotel El Castillo, stands, several table mountains can be seen, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
Many pages could be written about coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountains, the Bay of Pigs and the Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban patron saint Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion professed by the descendants of slaves.
But, as they say, it's better to see things with your own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans say.
According to the United States, too few troops and the lack of necessary equipment are affecting the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO should, in the words of Defense Secretary Robert Gates, draw up a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going according to their ideas, the representatives of the countries that have units stationed in the south of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to growing Taliban resistance, the eight participating states are also discussing further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, called on NATO units to be more active, Britain sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and stepping up development assistance.
"There is progress in Afghanistan, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to allow people to start developing the economy and security themselves, "UK Defence Secretary Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
Activity by Afghan insurgents has reached its highest level in five years, according to the U.S. Army.
The number of violent incidents has risen by 27 per cent compared to the previous year, and by as much as 60 per cent in the southern province of Helmand.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have reached an absolute limit in terms of the organisation and equipment of the units.
Specifically, they are calling for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about the concrete objectives for the next period and how we can achieve them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop made a similar statement today.
"I am not pleased with what we have on land and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the troops and equipment we need, and that's not enough, "De Hoop told Reuters at the end of three days of talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the countries involved, there has also been a dispute in recent months over whether all allies in Afghanistan are doing their best.
Germany, for example, has been criticised for its passivity.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is a minimum of violence and the fighting demands are not as high for them as for us in the southern and eastern parts of the country, "Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun this week described the German soldiers as lazy.
"Afghan idlers exposed: Germans play games while our boys fight," wrote The Sun in a post accompanied by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild newspaper went on the counter-attack and printed a picture of a British unit at a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
Government debt set to soar to £1trillion in 2009
Each Czechs has a national debt of CZK 84,000.
Total debt rose to 842.7 billion kronor by the end of September.
The government had planned to borrow $159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion, thanks to the better development of state budgetary policy.
The public debt of the Czech Republic rose to 842.7 billion kronor by the end of September.
As a result, they rose by 40.2 billion in the first nine months of this year.
Since June, however, they have fallen by $13.4 billion.
The Treasury confirmed its figures on the national debt at the start of October.
For every Czech there is a debt of 84000 kronor.
Over the whole of last year, the state was indebted by more than 111 billion kronor.
"So far, it seems that, thanks to the lower deficit for next year, we may not exceed the one trillion kroner mark until 2009.
Next year, the debt should be between 900 billion and 1 trillion kroner, "David Marek, an analyst at Patria Finance, told iHNed.cz.
Vladimír Pikora, analyst at Next Finance, takes a similar view: "We could exceed one trillion in the course of 2009.
Exactly when depends on the next budget, which we do not yet know.
If it turns out that the situation on the political stage is changing, and politicians are willing to save more, it could take until 2010.
But I don't expect that to change, "he said.
Debt Growing
The national debt stems from the debts of the state government and, above all, from the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
The public debt is financed by Treasury bills, government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, bonds issued by the European Investment Bank.
Domestic public debt has now risen to 719.4 billion kronor this year.
The foreign debt of the state meanwhile rose by 1.7 billion kroner to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable public debt reached 803.3 billion kroner at the end of September and has fallen by 13.7 billion kroner since June.
The average maturity of government debt rose to 6.5 years.
Total debt rose 13 percent over the year from the first to the third quarter, which is really a lot given how well the economy is doing.
It is interesting to note that the growth is particularly noticeable in bonds, where the increase is 20%.
It is bad that debt is rising, but on the other hand it shows that something can be done even before the pension reform comes, "Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
According to the financing strategy and the management of the national debt for 2007, the government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion kronor this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion kronor thanks to the better development of the state's budgetary policy.
This amount is mainly due to the state budget deficit, which is expected to reach 76 billion kronor this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion kronor.
There is also a maximum budget for the Consolidation Agency of CZK 13.3 billion, a reserve of CZK 10 billion to pay pensions, the financing of public bonds of CZK 43 billion and installments for bonds with the European Investment Bank of CZK 1.8 billion.
She was brought before a court in Khartoum today for giving a name to a teddy bear.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher, who had been accused of insulting Islam in Sudan, was sentenced by a court in Khartoum on Thursday evening to 15 days imprisonment and subsequent deportation.
The British woman has been accused of allowing six to seven-year-old pupils to give a teddy bear the name Mahomet, despite the fact that any depiction of the Islamic prophet is forbidden.
She deserved to be flogged.
After parents of students complained several times to the Sudanese Ministry of Education, the 54-year-old primary school teacher, who worked at Unity High School in Khartoum, was apprehended at her home on Sunday and charged under Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code with insulting Islam.
In fact, the affair began in September, when the teacher asked her six to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the classroom teddy bear.
The children suggest eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, school principal Robert Boules said.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 of 23 children choose Mohammed as their favorite first name.
Sure, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all a very common first name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for the class, with a photo of the bear on it and the caption: 'My name is Mohammed.'
The bear itself did not carry a sign with that name, but the problem is quite simple: the depiction of the Islamic prophet is considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said that he knew her well and that she had never done anything to offend a religious faith, I only regret that she asked the children to vote for a name, in his opinion it was just an innocent mistake.
An opinion shared by many of the teacher's students, who describe her as very attentive to her students and as a person who never talks about religion in class.
Consider that the first name Mohammed is also the second most common middle name in Britain, with 14 different spellings in English.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, is considered a kind of homage to the Prophet (it is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Can you give it to a toy, for example?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
At the last negotiating session in Vienna on Wednesday, no agreement was reached on the future status of the province.
The End of the Failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo concluded a sixth and final discussion session Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, without being able to overcome their controversies over the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties could not reach an agreement on the status," European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that peace in the region is at stake, its American counterpart Frank Wilsner called on Belgrade and Pristina to fulfill their obligations to maintain peace and to continue the talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
No violence is expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult period, he added, indicating that there are clearly tensions.
Conciliation ended on 10 December
The mediators of the troika, which brings together the European Union, the USA and Russia, will meet for the last time in Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, which is inhabited by 90% Albanian speakers, could become clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and the Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The Baden talks, near Vienna, were the sixth and final negotiating session since the troika received a mandate from the UN last August to mediate.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation mission to end on December 10.
The Russians, who had already blocked the approval of Kosovo's independence at the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations beyond that end date.
Russia has been and remains an advocate of a negotiated solution, an amicable solution, Botsane-Khartchenko said.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
After eight years of UN administration in Kosovo, Western countries see independence under EU supervision as the only solution with a future.
Pristina is prepared to announce them unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in their favour.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached, announced the President of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the hotel in Baden, where, since Monday, these last-chance negotiations have been held.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, shared his regret.
However, he added that the plan for autonomy proposed by Belgrade belongs to a past that has led to murders and deportations.
Domino's effect
Serbian President Boris Tradic, for his part, said that a compromise should always be sought and warned the Kosovo Albanian majority against the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence by the province.
Belgrade says it particularly fears a "domino effect" in a region so weakened by the independence wars of the 1990s.
For Serbia, this does not mean that compromise is impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision would be taken solely in the Security Council, where its Russian ally has veto power.
The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word
Only a decision from the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia, stated Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
These negotiations took two years.
They must end as they began: in the Security Council.
Fatmir Sejdiu told reporters that the Kosovo parliament would have the final say on the status, adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking population would be made in coordination with Western countries.
Bush elicits agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, which he chaired on Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He also said that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately to find a final settlement to the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything he could to help them reach a peace treaty before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy terrorist infrastructure, and Israel must halt its colonization work, Bush said, reminding the two parties of their commitments to the 2003 Roadmap for Peace.
The White House chief stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority under Abbas ultimately aim for a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues without exception, including the core issues.
This designation encompasses the three major issues at the heart of Israeli-Palestinian disputes: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of Arab refugees displaced from their homes in what is now the State of Israel in the 1948 conflict.
After the American president, Abbas spoke and insisted that the coming negotiations be comprehensive and thorough, and provide a settlement on all points, enumerating Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water and security, among others.
When Olmert spoke, he pledged that the upcoming cease-fire negotiations would be conducted directly and without interruption, and that he would seek to bring them to an end before the end of 2008.
Bush has set a deadline of the end of 2008 for implementing his vision of two states, one Palestinian and one Israeli, co-existing.
Saudi Arabia has disclosed that it received an assurance to this effect from Bush before deciding to attend the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis represents a major success for Washington, has initiated a plan adopted by all Arab countries that offers peace to Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis represents a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central points of view, the Saudi Arabian prince says in his interview with the Saudi-funded Arabic-language daily.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this type of local news, official versions and rumors are pitted against each other.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation by the National Police Disciplinary Office (IGPN), shortly after 5pm on Sunday, a police car drove along Rue Louise-Michel towards Villiers-le-Bel.
He was not deployed but was on patrol and was driving at 40-50km / h with no flashing lights, a police spokesman said.
A green motorcycle of the brand Kawasaki, without registration, thus not released for public traffic (see below), came, driven by two youths without helmets, with very high speed hit.
It rammed the left side of the police car after disregarding its right-hand drive, a police officer said.
The alcohol control carried out on the vehicle passengers turned out to be very negative.
The condition of the car (dented mudguard, splintered windshield, torn bumper) testifies to the severity of the impact.
Very quickly, as early as yesterday morning, the Public Prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she had entrusted to the IGPN an investigation into the "facts of involuntary homicide and failure to provide assistance to persons in danger," in coordination with the main public security directorate of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor stated that she excluded the responsibility of the police at this stage.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses to the accident, who were heard on Sunday evening, confirmed the police's version of events, namely that the moped approached her left side relatively quickly.
Yesterday a kind of groove, certainly caused by the friction of the footrests on the ground, showed that the two vehicles had remained interlocked until the police managed to brake.
The vehicles have been impounded and will be the subject of a technical appraisal.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday in Villiers-le-Bel, a rumour quickly circulated that the police had left the scene of the accident very quickly, and that without providing any assistance to the two youths.
Although the IGPN remains very cautious, it would also rule out any serious error in this matter.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigation that requires further investigation and needs to be handled very carefully.
Libération has met an eyewitness of those few moments shortly after the accident.
He had a direct view of the scene from one of his windows.
We immediately went out with my cousin, who is a nurse at the hospital, to try to resuscitate her, this witness says.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely distraught policeman limping.
Two others tried to resuscitate one of the teenagers, the fourth on the phone.
In view of the tension that had quickly built up around the event and, it seems, the certainty that those present had about the unexpected situation of the young people, the police officers were taken away in the car by colleagues who had arrived at the scene of the accident.
Still according to the witness statement, rescue workers arrived about twenty minutes after the police officers left.
They have also used heart massages, but to no avail.
I will not allow it to be said that the police did not help the young people.
These young people have been given first aid.
The fire brigade came immediately.
Every effort was made to try to save her, the prosecutor said.
Tensions rise in Pakistan
On Monday, Pakistani police crushed the first demonstrations since General Musharraf declared a state of emergency two days earlier.
In the eastern city of Lahore, about 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against the state of emergency were wounded by tear gas grenades used by police there, according to witnesses.
They then threw stones, injuring the policemen.
At least 350 lawyers have been temporarily detained.
There were similar scenarios in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and injured lawyers.
Several have been temporarily detained.
In Islamabad, lawyers for the Supreme Court's lawyers have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations following a wave of about 500 arrests of opposition activists, human rights advocates and lawyers over the weekend.
On Monday morning, the roads leading to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent the gathering.
Further demonstrations were said to have taken place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (north-east).
The legal movement won the support of the religious parties united in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal on Monday, whose president called on the population to send flowers to judges who have declared themselves against the state of emergency and to those who have taken an oath before Musharraf.
Musharraf's promise no longer applies
Pakistan's Supreme Court is directly affected by the special measure, which was announced Saturday night.
In the days that followed, he had to take a stand on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in a direct ballot on 6 October.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed from office and replaced.
All that we represent is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court, the magistrate told the newspaper The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to hand over command of the army and become a civilian president has not been fulfilled since a state of emergency was declared, Assistant Information Minister Tariq Azeem said Monday.
He was expected to give up his military uniform by November 15, the date his first term as president ends.
The Deputy Minister for Information has also confirmed that the elections could be postponed from January.
The Pakistani government also denied persistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf had been assigned a whereabouts by his deputy commander.
More than a third of pregnancies are still unplanned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth law allowing contraception in France, one in three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, according to a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined).
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the various methods of contraception, such as the pill or the coil, still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the institute, which notes that the percentage of women between the ages of 20 and 40 who use the pill has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalisation of contraception has nevertheless enabled better control of fertility.
In any case, eight out of ten births these days are carefully planned.
At one in five couples even calculated exactly for a month, and, if possible, in the spring, the season when it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the International Space Station (ISS) crew will have spent more than seven hours in space carrying out the spectacular repair of a faulty solar collector that is essential to the continuation of scientific work on the station.
A daring exit that has set several records due to its duration, the removal of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools crafted by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem arose on Wednesday when the astronauts unloaded the Harmony module from the space shuttle Discovery, a large cylindrical part that will soon house European and Japanese science laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module laboratories.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The crew's second task was to move a 17.5-ton solar-powered module that was already on the ISS to its final position.
After moving it, the crew set about restructuring the module's solar panels, which span 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors, which can be unfolded like accordions, was damaged by a trapped cable on a length of about one meter
Restructuring has been stopped so as not to further damage the collector.
The astronauts, who were originally supposed to leave the space shuttle Discovery for a check-up and then repair another solar collector whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to walk around the end of the 30-foot remote-controlled arm of the space shuttle that had been attached to the station to carry out the repair.
He is one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
Tall, tough, very skillful, he has a well developed upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old trained doctor was chosen to operate on the injured solar panel.
After carefully assessing the damage, he severed the faulty cable and attached a kind of rail to the damaged area.
He was joined by a second spacewalker who stayed close to the lock, and, from inside, by the other astronauts, including Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick wrapped in insulator to prevent an electric shock on the solar panels that generate several hundred volts, was conceived and crafted by the astronauts on board the station.
When the action was finished, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was fully unfolded before counting his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed a half-day of relaxation before seven astronauts returned to the space shuttle Discovery today, expected to return to Earth on Wednesday.
The EADS Stock Exchange Title Sanctioned
EADS shares are showing a marked decline on the Paris Stock Exchange after the aerospace and defence group announced that it would have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to tackle the backlog of A400M aircraft.
EADS is currently losing 4% to €21.96 on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to revise its business forecasts for 2007, citing the backlog caused by the slow development of the A400M engine, which is delaying the aircraft's maiden flight.
The costs announced in October to compensate for the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft amount to between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than one billion for Airbus, the parent company of European manufacturer EADS announced.
Because of these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operating performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 when it presents its quarterly results next Thursday, he added, without giving further details.
The group also says the assessment of the new costs is linked to the six-month delay.
As a reminder, EADS "business performance has fallen from 86% in 2006, largely due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, the very large A380 carrier.
The group originally planned to deliver the first A400M to the French army in October 2009.
Choosing the Status Quo
On Sunday, the counting of the polls will not be exciting: the mass of Russians will vote for President Putin's party, United Russia.
After a very closed election campaign, it confirms its desire for stability, even authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin is sending a message to voters broadcast on public channels, which has already been recorded but whose contents are being kept secret.
He does so in his capacity as the front-runner of United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party, for which a resounding victory is imminent.
Yesterday, the President left nothing to the imagination when he received the foreign ambassadors, and was content to deliver a new attack on the Western powers accused of meddling - his favorite topic during the election campaign.
We know the price of true democracy and we hope for honest elections, very transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the opposition's point of view, they got it wrong.
It denounces an election campaign tainted by oppression.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there had never been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After the suppression of the demonstrations last weekend, applies to former world chess champion Garry Kasparovder was sentenced to five days imprisonment for unauthorized demonstrations, according to his lawyer continues to ban visitors.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus
After this tense general election, two much wider questions arise:
Who will succeed Putin as president?
Yesterday, the official newspaper announced the date of the first round of the presidential elections, 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive term.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Chairman of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia party, which will select the government and president?
Whatever it is, in the parliamentary or presidential elections, the previous power will triumph.
That's tradition.
According to sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Levada Independent Centre, the Russians have retained the mentality of Homo Sovieticus and are not in control of their destiny.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the St Petersburg State University goes even further: in this country, which has been Christianized to Europe for five centuries, civil society has developed very slowly; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin resumed the model of a paternalistic state, which was fully embraced by the population, all the more so because this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by a certain economic prosperity, argues Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, Russians voluntarily relinquish the personal responsibility that they briefly displayed after the collapse of the USSR.
Why bother?
This phenomenon affects all walks of life, including the business world.
And the governing elite knows how to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 Russian regional leaders) top the United Russia's local electoral lists.
The new freedoms emanating from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: Why think for a long time?
Those in power are not so bad, so why replace them?
A heavy memory
After being kept confidential for more than 60 years, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are housed over a total length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen, could not be consulted until now, unless with a humanitarian intention, i.e. individually and by name, i.e. on request of a former victim or his relatives.
The eleven states entrusted with its administration - including Germany, France, Israel and the USA - agreed in May 2006 to make it accessible to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will make it possible to carry out research, especially on the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of the concentration camps and the state of health of the forced laborers, explains Reto Meister, director of these archives, which are administered by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were opposed to making these name-related documents available to the public because of the delicate nature of certain information.
For example, the alleged homosexuality or mental handicap of some deportation victims.
The prisoner lists of the concentration camps or the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo were compiled after the war for a practical reason: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labor, and possibly to provide them with evidence of their arrest, in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen process tens of thousands of personal enquiries.
Nevertheless, a part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
One must not expect anything fundamentally new in these documents, said Pr. Wolfgang Benz, head of the Research Centre for Anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin, in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008.
Currently, mutual trade between India and Europe already reaches some 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India's main trading partner, accounting for 18% of its external trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, said the European Union and India hoped to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
Last April, EU foreign ministers gave the green light to the European Commission to open negotiations with a view to signing Free Trade Agreements (FTA) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). Mutual trade between India and Europe already reaches some 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner, accounting for 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to European Commission figures, India is only the EU's ninth trading partner.
A free trade pact will boost the two economies enormously and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans, Peter Mandelson confirmed.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most frequently exported products by India, said the European Commissioner. Asian and European giants exchange goods worth 47 billion euros and services worth 10 billion euros annually, Daniéle Smadja, President of the European Commission's delegation in New Delhi, said this week, and regrets that reciprocal trade has not yet reached its full potential. On Friday, the EU and India will hold their eighth diplomatic meeting in New Delhi, attended by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barrosso.

Bank of England takes note of concern and offers £10bn for five weeks
The Bank of England showed concern on Thursday about easing recurring concerns about credit conditions by announcing a £10billion offer at a base rate of 5.75 per cent for five weeks, an offer with an unusual maturity.
In order to alleviate fears that conditions on the financial market will be particularly tough at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty about the way in which they should organise their liquidity positions during this period, the bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its savings during the conservation period, which begins on 6 December, in the form of an open market operation for five weeks, it states in a communication.
The bank also says that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put into circulation on December 6 at 12.15 GMT, at the basic rate of tax, and only until January 10.
This is apparently the first time the BoE has issued liquidity for five weeks in an open market operation.
This is usually done for a week.
In its communication, the BoE adds that it stands ready to take further action to maintain the day-to-day variation in the interest rates of interbank lending at its base rate.
The interbank lending rate, which varies from day to day, stood at 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month rate has levelled off to 6.6%, slightly higher since September 18.
Since the start of the financial crisis in the summer, the sums circulated by the Bank of England have been coupled with punitive fees that have discouraged banks from using them.
According to certain rumours, reinforced by the development of the pound against the euro, many preferred to sign for the sums put into circulation by the European Central Bank, at more advantageous interest rates and with safer discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to review PS 'spending power proposals
On Thursday, the groups UMP and Nouveau Centre refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
The text, drawn up in the context of a socialist niche (meeting at the initiative of a parliamentary grouping), indicated about ten measures adopted on Wednesday by the National Committee of the PS, the majority of which were on the employment allowance, the reintroduction of the floating tip, a transport cheque or the restriction of rents.
After the UMP and NC voted against the review of the articles (180 votes against 115), the meeting was dissolved after the main discussion, which led to sometimes violent exchanges of words between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's televised speech on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS, Jean Marc Ayrault, announced that his group would present the entirety of its proposals as an amendment to the Finance Correction Bill, which was examined by the Assamblee last week.
A new festival is born
Following numerous rumors regarding the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter / producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic by British producer Melvin Benn.
"It is an honor for our company to work with someone who has served as a role model for the current festival movement in America, no more and no less," Charlie Jones of C3 shared on Bilboard.com.
C3 hosts the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer camping destination.
The festival is scheduled to take place August 8-10 on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Festival Republic director Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the producers of the world's most prestigious festivals.
In 1989 he took over as director of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80,000 people a year.
In 1999 Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn, in his capacity as co-owner, has also taken care of the production, licensing and organisational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event he has ever been to, says his company and Melvin Benn's are working in parallel to offer the area a European-style festival event.
"We have chosen Philadelphia as the market and are working diligently with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia," said Charlie Jones.
We negotiated with the city and the commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we are stuck in political debates about the current administration, continues Charlie Jones.
"Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are making preparations to create a great festival in an exceptional place that will ultimately benefit the people."
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza Festival in Grand Park Chicago in 2005 after establishing itself in the festival world in 2002 together with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The two events generated gross tax income of $9.8 million and $11.8 million, respectively, in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
"Melvin Benn's European model is a rural festival, whereas ours tend to take place in urban green spaces," says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is, in one way or another, to merge these two concepts in order to give the impression of a rural festival in the European way and an urban festival in the American way."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, is joyfully shouldering the burden of this event," said Charlie Jones.
The latter declines to disclose the terms of the agreement, but confirms that "they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and to record a festival that will hopefully have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the festival's recording capacity is "very large," roughly equivalent to the 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says the invitations have been sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse, hoping to attract all kinds of viewers," says Charlie Jones.
His partners in C3, which won the Top Independent Promoter award at last year's Bollboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
It is not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood films to Montreal if none other than the Terminator opposes it.
These temptations are part of delegate duties.
A politically "sensitive mandate" because the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces "Runaway Productions."
Is it difficult to negotiate with the "governor"?
'You have to be careful because it's the industry that decides where to go.
If she thinks the conditions in Montreal are favourable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those we think are the best, "he says.
The run to the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, advancing cinema there is a top priority at the moment.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
All festivals on the West Coast, including Sundance, Denver, Seattle and San Francisco, will be about showcasing the films from Quebec, evaluating them and making sure the producers give interviews.
The Dark Ages had a successful showing at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be featured at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month, Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Is the stock market on the verge of an end-of-year rally? Experts disagree on the US mortgage crisis
With just under five weeks to go until the end of the year, investors are already rubbing their hands in anticipation of the coming end-of-year rally.
However, experts are unable to make reliable predictions in this regard.
Banif believes that purely statistically, the month of December on the stock exchange is usually accompanied by a positive market development.
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to make short-term forecasts based only on statistics, especially when serious tensions are dominating current market activity.
Although other experts do not approve of such a sharp rise in prices in the last few weeks of the year, they note that the market price is determined by the given liquidity of the market and of market participants, who, due to the lack of safe equity funds, mainly invest in pension funds, which are severely affected by the upward trend towards high-yielding assets.
Consequently, according to these experts, the stock market will tend to exhibit a more lateral price trend influenced by market fluctuations, mainly because we cannot yet estimate the extent of the possible fall in the US Federal Reserve's interest rate, an uncertainty that is mainly due to the rise in the price of crude oil and the risk of an increase in the rate of inflation.
Javier Barrio, head of sales at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a risky time to announce an imminent market rally.
The odds are not very good, the expert assures.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost 4% since its peak on 8 November of 15,945.7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative view.
According to Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could end the year successfully with almost 16,000 points, thanks to the restructuring of investment funds and the traditional subsidy to the pension fund, which takes place around this time each year.
Nevertheless, the expert points out that this year things could turn out a little differently, mainly due to the end-of-year rally already taking place in the second week of December, and thus immediately after the day leading up to Constitution Day.
According to the analyst, the price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, analyst at Bank Inversis, assessments of the market situation so far are at an almost technical level, which could lead to a deviation from the index values in the near future, the extent of which depends on the consequences of the US mortgage market crisis.
The analyst is confident that these will be positive.
Analysts agree on the selection of values that should push the Ibex to new highs.
Solana from Intermoney says that this year it is the turn of the big values.
The expert would count the two big banks and some real estate companies among the value winners, as the electricity sector will be too expensive in due course.
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha of Bank Inversis assures that the increases will be linked to the banking and industrial sectors.
If the rally does happen, real estate companies will benefit.
ACS has been catching up in recent months, and we hope other real estate companies like Ferrovial and FCC will follow suit, the expert said.
Regarding the increased consumption during the Christmas period, periodic consumption will dominate the market in the last half of the year.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are only present in a small number on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has seen prices fall only in two cases.
When the technology bubble burst at the end of 2003, this led the stock market out of its crisis and at the same time initiated the last real end-of-year rally.
This year, with the Ibex 35 up 28.17 percentage points, December's share price has risen 6.68%.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth profitable year in a row (the Ibex is up 8.36% since January) and also show an end-of-year rally remains to be seen.
Popular will have its 200 credit institutions open 12 hours a day from Monday to Friday.
Popular has decided to modernise a large part of its stores.
A total of 200 of these are located in the most economically powerful regions of Spain.
For the institute, which operates under the brand name Popular Max, these branches represent a major milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutions, as Popular is the first banking group to take the leap to extend the opening hours of its branches on weekdays until 8.30pm and on Saturdays from 10am to 8.30pm.
Banking group BBVA, which has also repeatedly announced the extension of opening hours in its branches, has not yet made a final decision.
The bank's ongoing negotiations with the unions appear to be aimed at reaching an agreement whereby 75% of all branches will be closed on Saturdays and open in the afternoon on a weekday, although not for customers.
Whether more banks will join the new initiative, which adjusts to business hours, will depend on Popular Bank's experience.
And that is precisely the intention that Popular pursues with its project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches which, due to their location, are able to capture the purchasing clientele of independent, small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as those of large department stores.
The bank plans to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months as opening hours are changed, not new.
To this end, the Bank will transform the premises of those branches that are already located in business zones, while adapting them to the individual customer profile of the different zones.
Thus, the extension of opening hours is combined with a new interior design of the branches, which is characterized by a more up-to-date, more colorful design.
The responsible bank representative, Ángel Rivera, asserts that the restructuring does not require major investments, but that it is accompanied by increased recruitment, as one branch no longer required six employees, but eight or nine.
The branches, which will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its concept at nine branches in Madrid.
And the results were positive, according to Ángel Rivero.
The branches of Bravo Murillo, O'Donell and Gran Vía have been chosen for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently manages about 2,500 branches.
And another 60, operating under the name Mundocredit, specialize in immigrants and also have extended opening hours, even on Sundays and public holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax, the BBVA model will not be used, as most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
"We don't want to be a competition for our customers," Rivero said.
With Telefonica, they have tentatively come to an agreement to sell mobile phones with the help of external bank staff.
The Spanish private broadcaster Telecinco doubled its stock market value for the first time, overtaking its rival Antena 3.
We made it.
With this sentence, the CEO of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, expressed his satisfaction at the close of the stock exchange, which had increased its value by two times that of its rival Antena 3.
But one aspect dampened his joy: That's exactly what hurt me; not that we had higher growth, but that we had lower losses, he noted.
He stressed that despite the weak market, they did not sink too low.
Telecinco ended the day up 2.54% yesterday.
The gain reduces its previous losses this year to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the goodwill has now reached 4,488.88 million euros, with Mediaset controlling the majority of the capital (52%) and Vocento holding only 13%.
Rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has posted a total loss of 40.5% since January, halving its market value to $2,193.46 million.
The market value of other listed communications companies, on the other hand, is increasing; in the case of Sogecable to 3,571 million, in the case of Prisa (publisher of the magazine Cinco Días) to 2,518.53 million and in the case of Vocento to to 1,779 million.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that these are two similar companies.
There is still uncertainty as to the extent to which we can actually trade on the stock exchange, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at customer level.
Telecinco announced a week ago its intention to become the first television station this year with more than 1000 million gross profits from advertising revenue, according to Guiseppe Tringali, CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group's advertising company.
If implemented, the deal would boost the broadcaster's advertising revenue by 3.6% from last year's $965.4 million.
In the case of Antena 3, net revenues increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million), while net revenues from the television business increased by only 0.7% (630.4 million).
Analysts believe that the main factor behind Telecinco's better performance on the stock market is the high payout ratio that the company has been able to show to date: in 2006, the company, headed by Alejandro Echevarría, initiated a 100% dividend payment.
However, Vasile assures that the ratio could still vary following the purchase of 33% of Endemol's shares, with Mediaset as the parent company, although it is too early to make an official announcement.
We are obliged by the official compromise to pay out at least 50% of the shares, even though we have always stated substantially more.
I hope that this year we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, whose share values we have already increased by buying 33% of Endemol's shares.
According to analysts, the market is currently showing some tendencies towards losses.
Lehmann Brothers recently cut its profit forecast for Telecinco by 4% for this year and 7% for 2009.
This is the consequence of the reduction in the projected growth rate, which will fall from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
It also lowered Antena 3 "s projected earnings forecast for 2008 by 4.5% and for 2009 by 7.5%.
3 options.

Ibersecurities: relies on its high effective yield and its sustainable potential and therefore recommends buying both stocks.

Caja Madrid: assigns Telecinco (buy) a more advantageous position than Antena 3 (hold) due to the multiple incentives and the prosperous market.

JPMorgan: Reset expectations in both cases in light of similar threats (saturated market and deteriorating economic climate)
Congress approves the MIFID directive, which entered into force on 1 November.
Parallel to the parliamentary drafting, which concluded its session today with the Congressional resolution in the Senate on the amendments / supplements to the project, the government published the provisions resulting from the new law with the intention of enabling the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
Representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of the members of Congress and the Senate, who in their negotiations and votes had pursued the goal of establishing the best possible regulation, which guarantees the safety of investors and regulates the individual business activities, in order to guarantee generally efficient market operations.
MIFID, which redefines the rules governing investment services, aims, in addition to the modernisation of financial markets, to improve investor protection, increase the supervisory role of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and promote cooperation between the various supervisory authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive will make it possible to offer financial advice to specialised firms as well as to natural or legal persons and will also contribute to the establishment of new financial services companies (ESIS), the advisory firms joining forces with investment and intermediary companies in securities.
It also expands the number of systems for executing financial transactions, adding to regulated circulation markets the multilateral systems of securities transactions and the systems for internationalising trade orders, which would eventually compete with current economic operators.
The law obliges investment companies to disclose to the market the focus of their company profile, the confrontation and ways of dealing with risks, and to register all projects carried out in order to facilitate the CNMV's control task.
The Congressional Economic Commission made further amendments in retrospect, and the decision that the securities must now be considered complex financial instruments due to their high level of risk for the investor was confirmed by the US mortgage and banking crisis.
It also took advantage of the entry into force of the directive on the legal limitation of the work of graduated economists, 30 years after the adoption in 1977 of the regulation restricting the work reserved for economists.
The Senate, for its part, determined new positions in the financial sector, such as that of the business mediator, who works on behalf of others, does not require authorization from the CNMV and can offer his services for the commercialization of products and customer acquisition simultaneously to several investment companies.
The harmonised index of consumer prices (CPI) rose by five-tenths in November and now stands at 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess inflation within the European Union provides the average price development in Spain in November.
Its publication is in accordance with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which aim to compare the location and quality of US products through the disclosure of the data.
The forecast for the indicator can be made ahead of time using the same approach as for the harmonised index of consumer prices, but at the same time using various other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not available at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) warned that the early indicator was only indicative and therefore did not have to correspond to the final result, which will be announced on 14 December.
The consumer price index (CPI) will remain at a relatively high level
According to the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Economy and Finance Pedro Solbes, the increase in the CPI in November was a temporary development, while at the same time he assured that the price index would remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
Nevertheless, in the halls of the Congress building, Solbes noted that even if the current figure is not good, Spain's inflation differential with the other members of the monetary union has remained more or less the same in recent years.
He also said there were fewer surprises in November than the previous month, when the government did not expect such a big increase.
We expected a figure of around 4%, the Minister of Economics and Finance announced in view of the forecast published today.
Virgin expects Northern Rock to generate revenues of more than £42bn over the next three years
Northern Rock's holdings fell by more than half after the bank asked the UK central bank for an emergency loan in mid-September last year in response to the crisis, and now stand at just £12,000 million (€16,800 million).
At that point, the bank's assets stood at a record £25,000 million, a sum that has fallen considerably in two-and-a-half months as customers lost confidence and will continue to fall until the end of the crisis, despite the Government's 100 per cent guarantee that the money is safe.
The company Virgin, which would continue to run the group under the Virgin Money brand after the takeover, would have to contribute about a quarter of the UK banks "revenues, which will come from assets held there over the next three years, to acquire exactly the £18 billion needed to meet its target of £30 billion.
The group of multi-millionaire Richard Branson, known for his eye-catching advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to pour 50,000 million pounds (about 70 million euros) a year into advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week named Virgin Group, in which three other companies have stakes, as its preferred bidder to lead it out of insolvency.
The mayor of Totana arrested for alleged involvement in urban corruption
This morning, Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the municipality of Murcia, Totano (Partido Popular), on suspicion of involvement in urban corruption, which was uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the head of the municipal police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, currently a member of the Popular Party and then the president of the Totana municipal council, last May and may have been the original mastermind of the plot, according to Cadena SER.
Officers are continuing to search the business records of the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and are not ruling out further arrests in the coming hours.
The lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the corruption case uncovered earlier this week, has also been charged.
According to the Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular and therefore privileged deputy Juan Morales was arrested while leaving his client's residence on the basis of important incriminating documents allegedly connected to the plot.
In addition, other sources tell of the alleged payments Morales made to a Galician construction company, which provided for the conclusion of an urban planning contract in which the development of a 200 hectare area was decided.
There are currently eight people in custody.
Bono agrees to accept the PSOE's candidacy in Toledo and, if elected, in Congress.
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. Accordingly, he will head the list of PSOE candidates in the upcoming general elections in Toledo and, if the Socialists win, assume the office of President of the Congress.
This was announced by José Blanco, PSOE Organizing Secretary, and Bono at the press conference following a meeting with Zapatero at the party's headquarters today.
The Prime Minister believes the offer to the former minister is justified because in politics it is important to be able to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
Moreover, if the Socialists win the upcoming elections, the Mancha-born politician would appear likely to run as the party's leader in Congress.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as Congress president, who announced last November 15 that he would not run in the next general election, ending his career in public policy and instead working in the university field to fight climate change.
The former minister was forced to admit that since resigning two years ago, the Prime Minister has been continually pushing for his return to politics.
He also pointed out that, as with the appointment of the Vice-President of the Economy, the party did not want to deprive citizens of who would take over the post of Congress President in the event of an election victory, calling it an act of transparency.
If he does take office, he hopes to turn the Chamber into a house of respect, not insult or shout-out, in order to make it look more and more like the people.
Unfortunately, from time to time, the impression is given that the only place in Madrid where it is not possible to speak calmly and calmly is the Congress; for example, the President of the Government was interrupted up to 26 times in the Senate.
At the same time, he praised the current President Manuel Martín and his good work and indicated that he did not want to give the impression that he had already taken office, otherwise his political opponents would call it arrogance.
Climate propaganda
Since the climate debate is relentlessly critical of both climate change skeptics and those who put social and political debate at the forefront of it, the movement as a whole needs to show strong cohesion.
Especially when it concerns a leader of the movement who, as in the case of Prime Minister Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change to be more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
However, this proposal leaves him short of explanation as to the actions or non-actions of his government, which has been instrumental in putting Spain at the forefront of the countries that have least complied with the Kyoto Protocol's requirements within the EU.
Who are those responsible for the non-fulfilment of the targets, to which sectors is this due, and why has his government, which had proposed the Treaty with the Planet, not stopped this development.
Furthermore, he is now obliged to explain to the Spanish citizens the measures he intends to take to combat climate change in no uncertain terms.
Which firms will be affected, what citizens' behaviour will be changed, what individual and collective austerity measures will have to be implemented, and what economic consequences will ensue.
Specifically, who has to sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
However, there have been and will be no such declarations in the future.
Precisely because it is about sacrificing and paying.
The measures that can be used in real terms to combat climate change are unpopular.
They are costly, inconvenient and threatening the accounts of businesses and citizens.
Even the gasoline cent proposed by the PSOE seemed so dangerous to Zapatero in terms of electoral strategy that he was forced to withdraw the proposal.
Accordingly, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, i.e. with pure propaganda and empty slogans without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, minutes and new offices.
With his treaties with the planet, the politician who is usually so suitable for election campaigns does not have to talk, accuse or demand, but instead pursues the demanding task of decorating the meetings and inspiring others with his gentleness and kindness.
However, this can only be done if the Treaty does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not stipulate that the bicycle will be the only means of transport in future or that we may refresh ourselves with just one compartment.
The mayor and the police chief of Totana due to alleged involvement in urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the town of Totana in Murcia, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo. In addition, the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor's office and a hotel entrepreneur were taken into custody on suspicion of urban planning violations, it was reported today from investigative circles.
The councillor was arrested at his residence, from where he was taken to the Municipal Office, where he remains to this day, surrounded by numerous agents who had also arrived at the Municipal Administration and the Municipal Construction Management Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests relate to last Monday's searches in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, which revealed that more than 2 million hectares of undeveloped land for urban development projects were to be transformed under the direction of the Galician construction company Nuaria, which was to build 4000 apartments on the site after receiving illegal commissions from the local administration during the last parliamentary term.
In addition, two other people were not directly arrested, but underwent an investigation, which is initiated and carried out by the first court of Totona.
The first six people arrested were brought before the judge today.
Investigators say the former mayor of Totana and current independent PP lawmaker Juan Morales is also under investigation.
His ex-wife, who owns a property company registered in Totana, and his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, are also under suspicion.
The president and owner of the Nuaria group, Manuel N.A., a lawyer and entrepreneur from Vigo, was arrested in the village of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as was Pablo José M.G., the managing director of Suelo de Inmonuar, whose company is said to have acted as a sub-group of Nuaria and received the bribe.
The investigation is being carried out by the Municipal Authority for Urban Crime, under the supervision of the Central Unit of the Civil Guard, whose representatives, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven other searches, most of them in companies directly linked to the arrests made in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry breeding business, who is said to have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was commissioned to construct the largest residential complex in the municipality of Murcia, comprising more than 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired an area of 2.2 million square kilometres in Totana, which was to be rebuilt with the aim of completing a construction project that would increase the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates in Vigo the parking spaces of the streets Coruña, Venezuela and those of Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the sector of direct marketing; and Preconiza, specialized in the promotion, sale and installation of components.
Things that can happen

If you agree, we will move away from the term Book of the Month and instead try to invent a different name with appropriate competence.
I already have a proposal.
People, life is about change.
Of course, you are cordially invited to submit your suggestions.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us the commentary published yesterday in the most important Finnish newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat (Finland, by the way, is at the top of the PISA study), which responds to the comment published in the same newspaper, on 18 November; coincidentally, on the day the issue of which contained the criticism of Blackburn's book.
After the tragedy at the Jokela School, the subject of philosophy has become the subject of public debate.
Responsible for the gruesome murders is a high school graduate who quoted the works of Plato and Nietzsche in his messages.
In an interview with the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper, Pekka Elo, chairman of the Council of Education for Philosophy, called on teachers to take a more critical stance towards Plato and suggested that Plato's teaching be removed from the lower-level curriculum for philosophy at grammar schools.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading a song would be a violation of the law, punishable by six months in prison.
However, if you rob a music store with a value of less than 400 Euros, this is only a simple offence (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the shop up to a value of 1000 Euros, then theft is considered a criminal offence, but the penalty is less than for a download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it forty hours later, the penalty is still less than for a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a brawl than in a music data exchange.
Participating in a rebellion carries a prison sentence of three to twelve months (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while the exchange of data results in imprisonment from six months to two years.
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment in the workplace is considered less serious than downloading a DVD film from the Internet.
F. The trade in copyrighted films, the authorisation of which has not taken place by the authors, is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).
Well, if my colleague is right, someone has stepped up his demands quite a bit.

My GP gives me one of his long, strange research articles entitled Money leads to activation of certain areas of the brain, especially when others get more of it.
So the feelings generated by the monthly paycheck depend on the salary of colleagues.
The study was conducted using a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the latest issue of the scientific journal Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Bonn Brain Research Center Life & Brain, the activation was strongest when the participant gave correct answers and his teammate failed.
The researchers could see that the brain activity was always very moderate if both participants were correct in their answers and therefore received the same content; but if one of them received double the brain activity was also stronger.
I am not quite sure that it really takes so much scientific effort to reach such a conclusion.
The Prosecutor from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly searching for the perpetrators of the Balkan wars for eight years. Her office is located in the Prosecutor's Office of the Criminal Court of the former Yugoslavia, located in La Haya.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave office with a weeping and laughing eye, as the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre - which killed eight thousand Bosnian Muslims - namely ex-General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, remain at large.
Their names are on a list that Swiss-born director Marcel Schüpbach uses as a model for the title of his documentary La Liste de Carla (2006, not yet released in Spain), a film that follows the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York at the pace of a political thriller as she seeks to track down the criminals who have escaped and put pressure on the respective governments to tighten their networks.
Which insurance is best for me?
Car insurance, which covers a possible damage caused by the driver, involves a high cost, the amount of which in turn depends on various factors, such as age, gender, time of issue of the driving licence, marital status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
Owning a car is just the beginning.
This is because it is even more difficult to find the right motor insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, let us be clear what we are dealing with here.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and a policyholder.
This agreement is set down in writing by means of an insurance contract, which stipulates that the company receives the agreed insurance premium and in return is obliged to submit the corresponding compensation amount in the event of damage.
The insurance premium is the price of insurance made up of several factors, including age, gender, time of issuance of the driving licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
Insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that higher premiums become due in the event of a higher risk of accidents.
This is why both over-25s and women have to pay less, as statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate thanks to their prudence.
The same applies to married people, since, according to the statistics and therefore also according to the conviction of companies, they are more prone to accidents than single people.
The benefits attributed to the vehicle affect the frequency of driving and hence the likelihood of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
Insurance companies must take a number of points into account when setting premiums.
For this reason, the driver also needs to study the situation thoroughly in order to select the car insurance that best suits his or her personal needs.
Here, we list the most important points to consider when choosing insurance, in order to be able to make not only a service-oriented, but also a price-oriented choice.
Those under the age of 25 face numerous obstacles when choosing low-cost insurance, such as poor driving experience and a young driver's license.
Even if it would be best to take out full comprehensive insurance for ideal cover, there are still cheaper alternatives.
Cautious drivers can choose a comprehensive comprehensive insurance with a deductible, so that the benefits of a comprehensive insurance are covered, but offered at a low price.
This type of contract implies that the customer must pay part of the amount incurred by the damage.
The amount is determined before the contract is concluded and based on the amount of the insurance premium, which is higher the lower the amount to be paid, explains Luis Noguera, principal representative of Spain at First Europa, an online insurance intermediary.
Another option is extended insurance, which insures the customer against external accident damage, but not against damage to the own car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's some advice.
If you are under the age of 25, it is up to you to reduce the cost of insurance, so your credit will be increased by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction of the basic rate with the corresponding insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment implies an increase in said tariff.
The amount of the fines depends on the company and its earnings.
When the company has had a profitable year, it can afford to increase bonus payments, Noguera explains.
As soon as the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to conclude a contract, due to the fact that the accident rate decreases with increasing driving practice.
It is therefore best to opt for comprehensive insurance with a deductible.
Usually, young people are not able to take advantage of their previous experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving, explains the Spanish head of the European company, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice, after the fear of the beginner has been overcome.
However, for a married customer who does not have children, it is more advisable to take out comprehensive insurance; of course only if the financial situation of the person concerned allows it.
Insurers consider married couples with children to be the customers with the lowest accident rates, and their premiums are correspondingly low.
In this case, a fully comprehensive insurance with a deductible (for an amount of around 300 euros) would be the best option. In the event that you have received a high credit, an extended insurance policy is recommended, which does not take effect until the third year of the vehicle.
Overall, they drive more relaxed and have greater purchasing power, which allows them to pay a higher premium, Luis Noguera notes.
For retirees, it is advisable to take out comprehensive insurance with a deductible (for an amount of around 150 euros), or an extended insurance policy, which only starts with a sufficiently high credit.
Finally, it is important to note that car insurance is very important, not only because it protects the driver against possible accidental damage, but also because it involves high costs, which require a thorough selection that corresponds to our personal situation.
Celtic's Glasgow hope to qualify for the quarter-finals in Milan
FC Milan and Celtic will battle it out in the San Siro next Tuesday for the point they need to reach their respective goals before the end of the Champions League group stage, with the Italians needing the point to go top of their group while the Scots will decide whether to take part.
The Italian side already have five points and have already confirmed their place in the fifth round with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic need another nine points to ensure that Shakhtar FC do not catch up with Befica Lisbon on six points.
The two Group D matches will take place a week before the end of the sixth round, as FC Milan will have to compete at the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, where it will compete for the first time in the semi-finals on the 13th, which will take place on the 16th.
So this group will be finished ahead of everyone else and the draw at the Guiseppe Meazza Stadium will be the result everyone expected, even though both teams will try to win. Because the Italians will not want to speculate at home, because Celtic Glasgow knows that if they win they would be first in the group and thus have a better starting position in the round of 16.
Even a defeat by Shakhtar FC could be enough for Gordon Strachan's team to qualify. However, he should not have too much faith in such circumstances, as the Ukrainians are entitled to participate in a nine-point tie, having lost in Glasgow last week (2-1), but were able to win the second game (2-0).
So Milan will try to spoil the evening for the Scots, who will be hoping to reach the last eight of the revamped Champions League for the second year in a row, having been beaten in the same round last season by a goal from Kaka in injury time (1-0) and a 0-0 draw in the first leg.
While Shakhtar FC awaits the victory of the Rossoneri, the team will have to focus on their own game, as both reaching the quarter-finals and joining UEFA will depend on their victory and defeat of Celtic Glasgow.
Benfica Lisbon, despite their low position in the table and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the biggest European championship, could win the third place and thus play in UEFA.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls kicked off their first tour since the band disbanded in 2000 in front of 20,000 people in Vancouver, Canada.
'Posh Spice '(Victoria Beckham),' Scary Spice '(Melanie Brown),' Baby Spice '(Emma Bunton),' Sporty Spice '(Melanie Chisholm) and' Ginger Spice '(Geri Halliwell) declared just before the start of their concert at the GM Place stadium in Vancouver that the mood in the reunited band was excellent.
Around 20,000 people were able to watch the concert in the sold-out stadium, where a video about the history of the band, which caused a sensation at the end of the nineties, was shown.
The reunion and the world tour coincide with the release of a new album featuring her biggest hits and two more new songs, headlines and voodoo, which will be released in Spain under the EMI label.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore gold armbands on stage, given to them by Posh Spice's husband, English footballer David Beckham.
The sportsman was among the crowd of fans who made the Palace incandescent, despite his wife Victoria's nerves having prevented him from doing so in the previous few days.
During the preparations for the show, Victoria Beckham revealed that the British star has never seen our wardrobe, so I'm really looking forward to seeing what he thinks of the performance.
Sporty Spice, whose departure from the group in 1998 due to internal disagreements led to the breakup of the group two years later, expressed her nervousness at a press conference two hours before the concert.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world had changed, that feelings towards the Spice Girls had changed.
And that's why I thought why not, so I'm glad I made that decision, "Chisholm said of the band's split nine years ago.
The singer also revealed that the disputes have been resolved and that they are now very much back together.
However, many things have changed since the Spice Girls last appeared together in 1998.
The group first arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane, according to CTV television.
Upon arrival at the airport, the band was greeted by an army of nannies.
The five have seven children together.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will next perform in California, San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
They will take to the stage in Madrid on December 23.
Fresh fears over gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute is brewing between Ukraine and Russia, increasing the risk that Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe will be affected.
Most of Russia's natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) pass through Ukraine, and any dispute between the two nations is closely monitored.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for the natural gas, it will be charged higher transit fees by Russia.
A previous conflict between the two states last year reduced supplies to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes at a time when the Ukrainian government and Russia's state-owned gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine must be charged more, as the group has agreed to pay up to 50% more for natural gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for Gazprom's imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in talks," Ukraine's Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters news agency.
"Changing gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments about the level of transit charges [to Western Europe] via Ukraine."
In the last major natural gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom cut supplies to Ukraine.
This led to a fall in exports to Western Europe, which pushed up prices dramatically.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union's supply.
Russia has the world's largest gas reserves, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom is supplementing its own reserves with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS needs to improve checks on criminal records for workers from outside Europe, a member of the watchdog has said.
The recommendation from chief financial officer Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was linked to the attack on Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also raised concerns that the Scottish NHS does not have a clear idea of the number of foreign staff it employs.
But his report pointed out that other key checks were carried out correctly in a sample of five health authorities.
The chief financial controller was investigating staff recruited outside the European Economic Area in the wake of the attack on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after an SUV drove through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video broadcast at the Old Bailey in October and has been charged in connection with the alleged car bomb attack in Britain.
The NHS is expected to carry out pre-employment checks on foreign staff to ensure they have the qualifications, experience and authorisation to work in the UK.
Although health boards use Disclosure Scotland to review criminal records, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside the UK.
The chief auditor's report now says, among other recommendations, that the board should adopt guidelines from the Criminal Records Review Act, which helps employers carry out inspections in different countries.
"Although we found evidence of these checks in some personnel records, they were not carried out routinely," the report said.
Black said Scottish health boards would follow their screening guidelines to a large extent before hiring, but added: "Our report identifies areas where the system can be improved to ensure accurate information is available on the number of overseas health workers."
BMA Scotland chairman Dr Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that pre-recruitment investigations would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks.
"The report states that current pre-appointment testing by NHS Scotland is working well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will provide," he said.
Scottish health boards say they currently have 1,161 foreign staff, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the Financial Conduct Authority warned that the number was likely to be higher, in part because boards were struggling to identify those employees who were on indefinite leave.
The investigation also found that established control procedures had largely been followed by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian.
These include passport, work permit and qualification checks.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policy and guidance on pre-employment checks for foreign staff in the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was keen to carry out this work in the light of the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
She added that the Scottish Government, in conjunction with health boards, would take into account the report's recommendations and ensure that best practice was reflected in updated guidance on pre-employment screening for all staff - including those from abroad - which is due to be published next month.
Joy Division dominates film awards ceremony
Control, the film biography of the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including best film.
Prizes were also awarded to lead actor Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before being cast for the role of Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and supporting actor Toby Kebbell.
Dame Judi Dench was named best actress for the thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond actor Daniel Craig won the Variety prize for bringing British film to the world's attention.
The awards were presented at a ceremony at London's Roundhouse.
Control follows Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
The black and white film - which features The Killers, David Bowie and New Order on its soundtrack - was made for just £3million.
Nevertheless, it won Dutch photographer Corbijn, best known for the iconic cover of U2 "s Joshua Tree album, two prizes - for best director and best directorial debut.
Rock music was the focal point of another award winner at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film about Clash singer Joe Strummer won the award for best documentary.
The best actor award went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as a Russian mafia boss in David Cronenberg's London-set thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing tough guys, has picked up the Richard Harris Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award, which was named in honour of Camelot and Harry Potter star Harris, who died in 2002.
"It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me," he said.
'I've been lucky enough to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my type of person, a great actor of his time, I'm really honored. '
The independent film awards, known as Bifas, are selected by a group that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organisers.
Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia over terror plot
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants for belonging to cells that had planned an imminent attack on an oil plant, as well as clerics and security forces.
State television of the world's largest oil exporter said one of the cells had planned to smuggle rockets in.
Al Qaeda sympathizers have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign citizen, was planning an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000-strong Rapid Reaction Force to protect facilities after a failed al Qaeda attack on the world's largest oil refining plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, citing an Interior Ministry statement, said 18 of those arrested belonged to a cell led by a "rocket expert" who entered the country illegally.
He said the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the kingdom.
Another 22 of the detainees planned to kill clerics and security forces, according to the report.
The government has warned clerics to do more to stop Saudis seeking to join forces with al Qaeda militias that want to fight allied forces and the U.S.-backed Shiite Muslim government, which is seen by hardliners among the Sunni Saudis as heretical.
Al Qaeda militias see many clerics in Saudi Arabia as cooperating with the authorities in supporting the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militias - accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born al Qaeda leader, to target the pro-Western Saudi government - have targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings, and energy facilities.
"This has been a very big effort by the security forces over the last... five months," an Interior Ministry spokesman told state television.
The arrests also concerned a "media cell" of 16 from Medina aimed at promoting "Takfiri thinking" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims that supports violence against Muslims branded as infidels and apostates.
Among those arrested were 32 people accused of providing financial support to the militias.
The climate on Venus could offer a glimpse of the future of Earth
Venus may once have been a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from an orbiting European spacecraft show that the planet resembles a distant twin of Earth even more than previously thought.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor of Earth.
The two worlds are about the same size and have similar planetary orbits, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Billions of years ago, Venus would have had conditions very similar to those on Earth and could even have been habitable, scientists believe today.
But because of the unchecked carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by solar radiation, and a slower pace of rotation, Venus took a very different course of development.
Today, the planet is deprived of water and has a surface temperature hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-force winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the European Space Agency's Venus Express spacecraft, which has been studying the planet for a year, offer a sobering look at how the Earth could evolve in the face of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor, from the Department of Physics at Oxford University, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: 'It is becoming clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, while the planets are otherwise quite similar.'
'Our new data allow us to construct a scenario in which Venus began billions of years ago like Earth, possibly with a habitable environment, 'he said.
'Enriched uranium 'seized by police
One kilo of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and that the material was being examined.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for $1 million (480,000 pounds).
All still open
Mitt Romney said he doesn't think it's worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Still, the Republican nominee for president eventually agreed to face a debate on YouTube in which ordinary voters videotape and submit questions to send to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday night, November 28, were as ridiculous as the snowman interviewing Democrats about global warming in the other party's YouTube debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time accurately reflected the state of the Republican Party heading into next year's elections.
It is not known how the producers of CNN, who co-sponsored the debate, chose the aspiring candidate to show YouTube clips.
But in the first half-hour of the debate, the longest devoted to a single issue, immigration took center stage.
The issue is one of the most potent topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to serve up a dial when they heard things they liked: The television station noted spikes in approval as the candidates talked sternly about the boundaries.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national front-runner, and Romney, who has moved ahead in crucial Iowa and New Hampshire polls.
Giuliani is trying to shake off a reputation for being soft on illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney, accusing the former Massachusetts governor of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
The two clashed particularly fiercely when questioners asked whether any of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (giving illegals regular status and the option of citizenship).
Minor candidates, such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, managed to catch up on the issue.
Neither man has a serious chance of winning the nomination, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they hit the immigration picket earlier and harder than others.
On immigration, at least, the candidates broadly share the same views: tighter borders, intolerance of illegal migrants.
This issue, along with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate clearly became problematic as other issues were raised.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported gun restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One of the questioners asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to argue that while the Bible was his favorite book, he might not literally believe the story of Jonah and the Whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, against all expectations, in first place in a recent Iowa poll thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When pressed on whether Jesus would endorse them, he laughed and said Jesus was too intelligent to run for political office.
The race remains exceptionally wide open.
Huckabee's rise in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul's recent fundraising success and his thunderous applause in Wednesday's debate.
These two have sprung up out of nowhere, because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the better-known and more traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one candidate united the party convincingly from the outset with a winning message about America's greatness and a wink to both wings of the party.
This time, the party is divided, and the outcome is far from clear.
Labour's pain
Gordon Brown has discovered another pit to fall into; his way out of it remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly slippery.
No titles appear to have been sold, no politician has paid Paris hotel bills, no extra-marital toes have been sucked.
But the revelation that a wealthy businessman has concealed donations to Britain's ruling Labour Party of more than 650,000 pounds ($1.3 million) over four years under other people's names, and that the party failed to report them, is something the embattled Gordon Brown would have done well without.
When, two months ago, the Prime Minister ducked the call for an election, foolishly insulting the intelligence of the British people by claiming that opinion polls had not influenced this decision, there was hope that he would provide a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly shrewd leader of the Liberal Democrats, put it, the once-feared Brown has gone from Stalin to Mr Bean.
The clumsy rescue of Northern Rock, a troubled bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire.
Badly thought-out proposals to change tax laws have turned business groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million people's personal data by the tax authorities exposed unimaginable administrative bottlenecks.
A trio of retired generals launched a rebellion in the House of Lords in protest at cuts to military spending: being an Armed Forces minister, they claimed, was a part-time job.
Now there are the multiple donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour's general secretary (and its former performance director) has already resigned.
None of this means Brown is heading irrevocably for resignation.
Yet governments can reach a tipping point after which they feel it impossible to govern.
People neither like nor trust politicians, but they usually hold back their skepticism when a new force takes office.
Once it is clear that a prime minister is unlikely to improve the situation, and he does not even need to be there for long, that delay is over: the civil service is beginning to leak; cabinet ministers are starting to talk; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is becoming defensive and aimless.
In one way, Brown's position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new broom.
As much as he would like to disown Tony Blair, he was his lieutenant-in-chief.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax dodgy dossiers, for example, are linked to decisions made by Brown as Chancellor of the Exchequer.
And even if he was not directly involved in Blair's misfortunes - as with the long "money for honours" inquiry into political party funding - voters may assume he was.
Still, Brown's situation isn't quite as bad as it looks
The failings are not as terrible as the Conservatives describe them.
As with Mr. Bean, no one has died, or been robbed entirely.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Brown's naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: reliable, solid, and slightly brutal government.
The new fuss about political donations is a good example.
The Garboesque Abrahams, who compares his donations to his charitable gifts, says he doesn't want public recognition for his benevolence.
It may be so, but it was not for him to decide.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear, and they exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who run the country.
Watt, who says he knew about Abraham's agreement but did not think it was illegal, will of course have to face some questions, as will Jon Mendlesohn, Labour's chief fundraiser, who was told about the strange donations in October.
But so far, Brown is not involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew about the confusion, even though most of the payments were made after he took office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the job.
He was quick to condemn his party's violation of the law, but he diluted that resolve by reaching for a well-known tool, a committee of inquiry into the issue - led, to put it mildly, by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the "lessons to be learned" are not very complicated.
If the law has been broken, it's a matter for the police.
Apart from that, there are other things Mr Brown needs to do, such as find a permanent chairman of the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has been vacant for six months, and move forward with sweeping reform of political party funding.
That would require Labour hardliners to work with the Conservatives and possibly abandon the special financial relationship with the unions - bitter pills for a party colleague like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some partisan facts.
The Conservatives now have a clear lead in the polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way he can win is through unimpeachable probity and solid competence.
Card sharks
Is America's credit card market on the verge of a credit crunch?
When there is blood in the water, it is only natural that dorsal fins twirl around excitedly.
Now that America's housing market is ailing, the predators have their sights set on the country's credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs reckon credit card losses could reach $99 billion as the contagion of underfinanced credit spreads to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There has been an increase in both cancellations and default rates, which measure the proportion of loans that are either non-recoverable or more than 30 days late.
HSBC announced last month that it had taken a $1.4 billion charge from its American consumer finance arm, in part because of the weakness of credit card borrowers.
However, it is too early to panic.
Losses and delays are still low.
According to ratings agency Moody's, the third-quarter default rate of 3.89% was nearly a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can partly be explained by technical factors.
A change in America's private bankruptcy laws in 2005 led to an abrupt fall in bankruptcy filings, which in turn accounted for a large portion of card losses; the number of filings (and thus default fees) would rise again, whether or not the overall conditions for borrowers worsened.
The industry also reports solid payment rates that show how much of their debt consumers pay off each month
and confidence in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the stalemate in other corners of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup, a research firm, reckons spending in 2007 will ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
There are certainly direct channels of infection between the housing credit crisis and the credit card market: consumers are more likely to take out credit card debt now that home loans are drying up.
Card issuers, however, look at the flow of money rather than capital values, so falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the borrower's creditworthiness.
They can even be beneficial for card issuers.
The incentives for consumers to continue paying mortgage rates decrease when the real estate is worth less than the value of the loan; as a result, card debt becomes more important among repayment priorities.
Card issuers can also react much more quickly and flexibly than lenders to the stormy conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should, in theory, reduce the risk of a rapid revaluation of assets.
"We're not going to wake up one day and completely re-evaluate the loans," said Gary Perlin, Capital One's chief financial officer.
Even if a sudden underfunding crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained downturn are much more real.
If lower house prices and a credit squeeze push America into recession, the industry will no doubt face a grimmer future.
Keep an eye out for these shark fins.
British bankers plead guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who were due to stand trial for their role in the fraudulent scheme with Enron's former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow changed their pleas to guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally pleaded not guilty to seven counts of wire fraud for allegedly conspiring with Fastow in a secret financial scam in 2000 to enrich himself at the expense of his employer.
The trial had been set for Jan.
But during a court hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. each pleaded guilty to one count of fraud using telecommunications equipment.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, became known in Britain during extradition proceedings that lasted two years.
In the United States, her case marks the end of an investigation launched after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The charges originally filed against them in 2002 drew Fastow's attention to the fact that he was the target of a government investigation into Enron's demise.
The indictment against the bankers - dubbed the "NatWest Three" - alleges they came to Houston in 2000 to concoct a fraudulent plot with Fastow and his former top adviser Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partnership controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of myriad fraudulent Enron schemes that helped drag the company into the maelstrom of bankruptcy.
By early 2002, the bank had estimated the value of its stake in the subsidiary to be zero, but the three British men knew it actually had significant value.
A company controlled by Copper bought the bank's stake in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for a stake in the company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely claimed to Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its stake in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the $20 million went to British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others raked in about $12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy for his role in Enron's bankruptcy.
The British trio were arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year sentence in a Louisiana federal prison.
Kopper is serving a sentence of three years and one month at a facility in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was at large on a $1 million bond that required them to live in the United States while awaiting trial.
Enron, once the nation's seventh-largest company, crumbled in bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of accounting trickery could no longer disguise billions of dollars in debt or make failing ventures seem profitable.
The collapse wiped out thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion in market value and more than $2 billion in pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in the Enron collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were nullified after he died last year of heart disease.
Not at the bottom in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least $54 million.
But that's small change for some of the rich Russians.
"It can accommodate up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
'But none of you ask for that many seats because it's for a private family or a company president. '
Firer was at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaire's Exhibition, a four-day orgy of showcased consumption held in a nested exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury vendors had set up exhibition stands, hoping to interest newly-minted Russians in everything from mahogany-paneled yachts to diamond-encrusted car grills that would be reasonable for 50 cents.
Firer carefully set his sights on a shiny orange Porsche at the next booth.
"That's a nice car, but it's small change compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Fueled by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems as awash with money as Dallas was in its heyday.
"We went through the same phase in the 1890s, when some Americans came to gigantic wealth and flocked to Europe, where they were seen as materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a scholar at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arabian high flyers of the 1970 "s and the Japanese of the 1990" s, the Russians emerge as the world's most visible lavish spenders.
The most exclusive luxury brands are seeking their share of the gold rush.
Elsewhere in Moscow, a luxury industry conference this week attracted Donatella Versace, Tom Ford, and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell high-priced goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires who total $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
Moreover, 103,000 Russian millionaires are in the second class, worth a combined $670 billion, according to a study of the development of private wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists at the Center for Economic and Financial Research, an expert panel here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the subsistence level.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative for David Morris, a London jeweller.
It was the first time she had attended the show with the brand's Russian distributor, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all exemplary and the men are all worth a fortune."
Two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, describe themselves and their clients as millionaires as they wander the halls in evening wear on Sunday night.
"I've looked at the cars and I'm trying to choose between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Ms. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes she wore, like a red-carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The show seemed to be aimed primarily at the nouveau-riche, the type of brand-conscious Russian shoppers who would be willing to stand for several hours in traffic jams to visit a draughty warehouse that shamefully juxtaposed Cadillac Escalades, platinum pocket knives, Mövenpick ice cream, bespoke pool tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund teddy bears.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
"Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, sitting patriotically at a booth of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a Rembrandt painting made of hand-painted blue mosaic tiles.
"Of course Russians are more interested in Klimper-Klimper."
In fact, traders here say that Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old by Russian standards) have already moved from swaggering logos to the kind of sober, limited-edition brands that would not be marketed at a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people, whether millionaires, ambassadors of millionaires or simply tourists, crowded through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil Beds here, said he had sold two $70,000 mattress sets made of silk, cashmere and cotton with sewn-in gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with high-end alarm systems, said his company sold the bright orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for $170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said he had sold three car radiator grills for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, which resemble interconnected chain bracelets, for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter a car tire designed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes that he had covered with colored Swarovski crystals to make it look like a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for a four-pack.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a cubic zirconium picture of his wife's face is not necessarily going to ride those wheels," Mr. Karapetian said.
'He'll keep it in his 30- or 40-car garage. '
Although many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian said the phrase "Russian millionaires" doesn't mean much at the moment, given the rise in local real estate prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you are probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at a booth run by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four British-style red phone boxes crammed with piles of fake million-dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his staff printed 500,000 fake banknotes for the millionaire fair.
Passers-by stopped to toss piles of money around, take mobile phone photos as they recline amid the spare riches, get snapped by friends, or simply poke a few million.
"Look, everyone in Moscow can feel like a millionaire," Mr. Karryev said.
Bungled operation suspected in New Jersey death
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched an ambulance stop two doors down West Scott Avenue on white Cape Cod.
Soon after, there was a police car there.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the medical coroner's van coming up," Livingston, a supervisor at the restaurant, said Wednesday.
'That's when I knew someone had died. '
Authorities learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41, an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Investigators are now trying to determine whether she died because of a procedure performed by an unlicensed cosmetic surgeon, whom police did not identify, who worked at the house at 212 West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have not yet determined what caused Ms. Arroyo's death, and are hopeful that toxographic tests, the results of which may not be available for weeks, will help solve a mysterious death that has sent a shudder through Newark police leaders.
Ms. Arroyo had been an assistant to Police Chief Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard-working and tenacious," Mr. McCarthy said of Ms. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
's been my pitbull.
She protected me. ""
McCarthy said that Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she is survived by two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for Union County Prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow, said investigators were trying to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of unapproved surgical treatment.
"That's one of the possibilities," Ms. Walsh said.
'It's an ongoing investigation. '
Authorities said they arrived at the house about 3 p.m. on Nov.
And they found Ms. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was pronounced dead at the scene.
More than a week has passed and authorities have said little about their investigation or the owner of the house, who is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh would not say whether Ms. Castro was questioned by authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine whether part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Ms. Castro's house, where a wilted rose bush stands in the front yard and a Dalmatian barks behind the house.
A blue barrel labeled "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - sat in the parking lot next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo was invaluable and helped him navigate the provincial and tough political culture in his new city.
"She said, 'You have to pay attention to this or that,'" he said.
was always here when I got here and she was always here when I left.
It's been embarrassing. '
Hopes central bank will cut interest rates lead to rise in world stock markets
Stocks jumped yesterday on both sides of the Atlantic after market hopes that the central bank will try to calm credit markets with further rate cuts were buoyed by soothing comments from the vice chairman of the US central bank.
Stock markets rose in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kahn, the number two pick of Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the central bank, said policymakers needed to respond "flexibly and pragmatically" to ongoing pressures in financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm angry markets in the face of signs of rising credit tensions, Kohn said the recent turmoil had "partially reversed some of the improvements in market functionality from late September and October."
If the heightened turbulence persists, it would raise the possibility of further tightening financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were seized on by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to step in and stabilize credit conditions with fresh capital injections into US markets and possible further interest rate cuts.
The remarks also helped to calm Wall Street in the face of more bad news from the U.S. economy, as sales of U.S. homes hit a new record low in October.
The fallout from the financial turmoil was underscored by the announcement by Bear Stearns, the investment bank, that it would eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of its global workforce, in a cost-cutting move to offset heavy losses from its lost bets in the US mortgage lending sector.
Only 20 of those jobs are expected to disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial index jumped 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the broader S & P 500 index rose 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7 per cent, to close at 6,306.2, adding more than £39bn to the value of UK stocks.
Germany's Dax index rose 2.6 percent and France's CAC40 rose 2.3 percent.
Earlier, the resurgence of credit pressure on the markets was underlined after strong demand for an auction of European Central Bank three-month guarantees granted to European commercial banks was lent at a remarkable 4.7 percent, the highest rate since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England, the US Central Bank and the European Central Bank to follow suit and inject more capital into the money markets in London increased as credit tensions saw three-month "Libor" rates for lending between UK banks rise to 6.59 per cent, their highest since late September, after a steady rise since November 21.
England face decision on Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara claims
Here are two dilemmas, each almost as difficult as the other.
Who should bat at No 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a wider context than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the selectors "chairman, is here on call, at least under this particular title, to help head coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan decide, and because the table of High Morries, the England managing director, is gradually filling up with applications for national selections, if not part-time ones.
Whoever does not get the sixth bracket will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sport undoubtedly is.
It is never easy to nail down exactly what enables a person to reach the top of their profession, while someone else never gets above the lowest rank, sometimes for lack of luck rather than ability.
It's not just in cricket where selection is difficult, where judgments are always subjective in the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara to step up?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same might be asked in another area, for example, whether John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young executives with good degrees who know the business well, should be promoted.
Who can say what class a cricketer is, unless he is given the opportunity to swim or sink?
Of course, numbers have a big influence on decisions, but chances are they do.
Within a team, a cricketer needs to catch the captain's eye at the right time if he can take a wicket and a batsman needs to get regular opportunities on the order if he wants to make an impression as a one-day cricketer.
Catching the eyes of selectors is more complicated.
There were many who were better last season than, say, James Anderson, who looks set to play in the first Test even if Stephen Harmison declares himself healthy and bowls like the wind is blowing in the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets at 33 runs each to earn a place on this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average but both had their highlights and are hoping for more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays at Asgiriya Stadium can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it may just make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and was successful in the first, taking five wickets and scoring 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, then still struggling to cement himself, who made the breakthrough into a major Test cricketer and who, despite scoring a double hundred against Australia in Australia, is perhaps still underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after further discussion in today's nets session at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and gut instincts for Shah's greater experience of Bopara's youthful enthusiasm.
There is an argument for both.
For Shah, his scintillating and valuable 88 Test debut innings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and just six from Bopara, who at 22 is seven years his junior, and an excellent record against spin balls speaks for itself.
But Shah made just ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the Test at Lord's, his home ground as a Middlesex player, and this, plus his immediate rejection by the selectors when Vaughan was healthy to resume his position for the next game, appears to have taken the momentum from his batting, which was still evident in Bombay.
By contrast, the Essex all-rounder has a zest for life.
He is unfazed by anything on a cricket pitch and his attitude away from it was summed up when he knocked over a four-wheel drive vehicle in a recent exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was get his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) out and call his team-mate Alastair Cook, who had been watching it from afar, and say enthusiastically: "Did you see that?"
Bopara is a much better fielder, he bowls his middle pace with some impact here on the pitches, which seems to suit him, and beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe that's the real art of selection.
I'm inclined to give Bopara his chance now, which doesn't mean Shah might not do well if, as the tea set from Ceylon suggests, he's the one playing here this weekend.
Buses Bring Refugees Back to Work - and to Fight Al Qaeda
The first busloads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced people whose funds or visas have run out and others hoping the city will return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the rebels who had driven them from their homes.
At Mansour bus station, before 800 people arrived from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was busy with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transports.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspaper, about what happened in Baghdad and how it would be safe now."
They say that the Mahdi Army has stopped killing people, "he said, referring to the Shiite militias of militant cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to withdraw.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime does not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local, US-backed militia had helped drive al-Qaeda out of its stronghold west of the capital and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who was driven from his home in Sleikh, north of Baghdad, by a hand grenade attack after urging his fellow citizens to fight al-Qaida.
He was coming back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they were starting an anti-Al Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my boys.
That's why I returned today, "said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said they had been lured by the increasing calm in the capital since the U.S. troop surge and the growth of local "groups of concerned citizens" who are armed and working with the American military to defend their neighborhoods.
But more said they had been forced home by visa problems and dwindling funds in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old father of three, expressed widespread suspicion among exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees in order to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people are believed to have fled the country's sectarian death squads.
"We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government urged Iraqis to stop giving visas to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunni pensioner.
'I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house down after I left. '
Part of the reason for the drop in violence is that Sunnis have been driven out of Shiite neighborhoods and vice versa, creating many places where tensions have eased.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will reignite sectarian tensions and lead to conflict.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal state is a leader in vocational training and even boasts the international orientation of its universities.
Only in one area of education does the Saarland have the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"Yesterday, for the 50th time, I explained to a non-Saarland country that we are not French" - this slogan the smallest federal state self-ironically placards on its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in Saarland's education system, which ranks fifth in the Education Monitor of the Institute of German Business in Cologne (IW).
For example, universities have a long tradition of cooperating closely with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded by the French in 1948.
Until today, students can complete their studies here with a double or even triple diploma.
The proportion of foreign students is correspondingly high at 15.6 percent.
But Saarland also brings the state's children to higher education in above-average numbers - many of them without a high school diploma.
"In Saarland, people use the vocational education system," says Axel Plünnecke, an education expert at IW.
More than one in five young people acquire their right to study at a vocational school, which means that Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the national average.
The possibilities for combining vocational and academic training are also comparatively strong.
In terms of population, the provision of dual courses of study is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
That is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now obliged universities to launch a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
"We initiated a number of reforms in general schools after the first Pisa study," says a spokeswoman for the Department for Education.
For example, the government introduced nationwide comparative testing.
In order for children to start learning earlier, the last year of kindergarten is free of charge - a model that other federal states are now copying.
Only future comparative studies will show whether pupils "performance improves in the long term.
At Pisa in 2003, the proportion of high-risk students shrank from 29 percent to 20 percent.
Overall, however, Saarland did not increase as much as other federal states.
The Bavarians reckon better.
And to the annoyance of the Saarlanders, foreign language skills are not measured at Pisa - otherwise you could score points in this area.
For grammar schools are obligatory in the language of their neighbours - even if the Saarlanders are not French.
Chávez turns the clocks back
In Venezuela, the clocks are about to tick differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez has the clocks in the South American country turned back by half an hour.
In Spain, meanwhile, Chávez is becoming a joke.
According to a new law, clocks will be set to Universal Time minus four and a half hours, according to the Venezuelan Official Journal.
This gives the South American state a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
The anti-US Chávez justified his decision, among other things, on the grounds that the United States had imposed full-hour time zones on the world.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) that relations with neighboring Colombia had been severed due to a hostage affair.
The left-wing nationalist said that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia, he will not have relations with the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I cannot do this simply because of my dignity," said Chavez, who is pushing a constitutional reform that the oil country's citizens must vote on in a referendum on Sunday.
The reform would significantly increase his power in the country.
The dispute was triggered by Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate to negotiate with Marxist rebels in Colombia for the release of hostages.
Uribe had "spat in Venezuela's face" with his decision, Chavez had criticized on Sunday.
In Spain, too, Chávez is on everyone's lips.
A new mobile phone ringtone is causing a sensation in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you shut up) is the phrase that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the Internet.
He was spoken by Spain's King Juan Carlos, who at the recent Ibero-American Summit was annoyed by the constant heckling of the left-wing populist and had pushed him over the edge.
Germans face 2007 wage cut
Despite the strong economy, German workers are forecast to lose real wages this year.
Experts cited a host of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans Böckler Foundation, employees could expect less in real terms in 2007 than in the previous year.
Gustav Horn from the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research told the Bild newspaper: "This is due to the modest wage growth, the increase in value added tax and the price spikes in food and energy prices."
Employees could also face new burdens in terms of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung that the planned lowering of unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the turn of the year was right and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the SPD politician was quoted as saying that the Federal Employment Agency should not again be embarrassed to have to ask the federal government for loans or grants.
On Tuesday, it was revealed that the explosion in food and petroleum prices had driven inflation to its highest level in 13 years.
Overall prices rose by 3.0 percent year-on-year.
Venus is the hellish twin of Earth
Despite its hostile atmosphere, Venus is more similar to Earth than previously thought: the European space probe "Venus Express" has detected lightning in the atmosphere and wind swirls at the poles, which also occur on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have suspected that it is flashing on Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus Express" has provided the proof - it detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: The lightning flashes on Venus shoot from cloud to cloud at an altitude of around 56 kilometres, reports Christopher Russel from the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific journal "Nature."
According to the famous "primordial soup theory," lightning created life on Earth: thunderstorms are said to have triggered reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: "If there was ever life there, it must have been in very early history," says Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there is hardly anything alive on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, temperatures of 500 degrees sometimes prevail.
"Venus may be Earth's devil twin, but it's a twin," Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in mass and size, has embarked on such a completely different development is the fundamental question of the Esa mission.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, as no spacecraft has traveled specifically to explore this planet since the early 1990s.
According to the researchers, the latest research results, which are now presented in several "Nature" articles, underline not only the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"They also show that the similarities between our neighbouring planet and Earth are greater than first thought," says Esa.
In addition to the already known whirlwind at the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloud vortex at the South Pole that rotates much faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents in the earthly winter hemisphere, according to a research team headed by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as Earth and is almost as large with a diameter of 12,100 kilometres.
The planet, also known as the morning or evening star, orbits the sun in just under 225 days.
But it rotates much more slowly around itself: a Venus day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, bears little resemblance to Earth, scientists assume that the two planets formed under very similar conditions.
On both, water accumulated, which remained in oceans on Earth, but was lost to space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed in carbonate rocks on Earth, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler calls for an end to the partisan dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for its attacks on the chancellor after the September meeting.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's reputation and has called on the grand coalition to put an end to the dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue," Köhler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler signaled understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity for me, even though I have respect for the diversity of cultures," Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany must maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, stressed the Federal President, but defended Merkel from the accusation that she is pursuing a new policy on China.
The Chancellor has not abandoned the traditional one-China policy.
China knows that, "Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed displeasure at the reception given to the Dalai Lama and had therefore come under attack from within the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier deplored the Union's "window dressing" policy in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery, there were violent irritations in German-Chinese relations.
For example, the Chinese leadership not only unloaded German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also froze the so-called Strategic Dialogue between the foreign ministries of the two countries, according to Spiegel.
China's leader, Wen Jiabao, has now called on German Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit that receiving the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China refuses for European politicians to receive the Tibetan religious leader in an official capacity, Wen Jiabao reiterated the Chinese position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama showed that he was trying to separate Tibet and the wider Tibetan region, which also includes other provinces of today, from China.
Schäuble warns of riots like in France
Street battles with the police, gunshots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns of riots like in France.
Everything must be done to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not turn into violence on the streets, the Federal Minister of the Interior called for.
Barricades were burning and rioters fired shotguns at the police. After the serious youth riots in France, the Federal Minister of the Interior, Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU), fears a similar development in Germany.
"We must take care that social explosives do not build up in our country and explode into violence.
We have to take this seriously, "he told the" Neue Presse "newspaper in Hanover.
Not every young person can cope with the rapid change in social reality.
The federal government, states and municipalities were already working hard to reduce problems, Schäuble said.
This does not only concern the integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islamic conference, this is already showing initial success."
However, it is too early to give an all-clear.
Schäuble also pointed out that there are no urban and sociological problems in German suburbs as there are in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, youths had been engaged in heavy street battles with police in recent nights.
Cars and public buildings also burned in Toulouse.
However, the chairman of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat, called for greater integration efforts by the Federal Government.
In the light of the riots in France, Kolat warned of "copycat effects."
Admittedly, the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, there is a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people with a migrant background under 25 years of age is "above average."
Above all, more training places had to be provided.
Kolat stressed: "We have to give young people a perspective."
But the head of the Turkish community added that in Germany, more than in France, "there is social control in the families."
In addition, many young people with a migrant background did not want to destroy what their parents had built up here.
Kolat cautioned: "But we must be careful nonetheless."
Young people must be "given the opportunity to participate quickly in work and training."
Meanwhile, the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel remained largely quiet through the night.
Hundreds of police were deployed, with a helicopter flying over the area with spotlights.
Authorities reported three arrests, as well as a few burning bins and cars.
Since the day before, a contingent of around 1,000 security personnel has been keeping calm.
The police will take as long as it takes, announced Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie after a visit to the suburb.
Around 80 police officers were injured in riots in Villiers-le-Bel on Tuesday night.
On the following night, the riots spread to Toulouse.
The riots were sparked by a traffic accident that killed two teenagers on Sunday.
According to the initial findings of the public prosecutor's office, the police are not to blame for the deaths of the youths.
In the realm of Angela Wolke
The Chancellor's out-of-touch performance shows that the Coalition is finished - and there is no room for complacency.
What country does this Chancellor live in?
After her dismal performance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was sour and devoid of content, it must be said: not here - not in the country that she would finally have to govern.
Angela Merkel has rejected the accusation that she concentrates too much on foreign policy with a very arrogant sentence.
This is provincial, she said, showing that she doesn't want to understand what the critics are talking about.
In the Bundestag, it has been clearly documented for all to see how true their reproach is.
There was no tangible interest or even a sense of the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Merkel presented herself: an aloof politician who takes refuge in foreign policy and stays in the rough even there.
Take climate protection, for example: she is full of praise for the Heiligendamm resolutions, but does not say how the climate goals are to be achieved in this country.
In general, the self-praise - the CDU leader would have refused so much immodesty just two years ago.
Now it is clinging to the mantra that the recovery is with the people.
In doing so, she tarnishes her image as a pragmatist who solves problems rather than whitewashes the world.
But in Angela Merkel's kingdom, domestic problems are a fringe issue.
Child poverty and the concerns of low earners?
She has a few subordinates left over for that.
It is telling how often she promises herself when it comes to the child benefit.
Merkel needs three attempts to come up with a reasonably straight sentence.
It stumbles as if on strange terrain, when it becomes concrete.
Attack Unit
In the Republican presidential candidates "YouTube debate, the two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, face a tough battle - and must now fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates discharges itself already with the first topic.
Mitt Romney has accused his opponent Rudy Giuliani of turning New York into a "sanctuary for illegal immigrants."
For his part, Giuliani counters with serious accusations: "I would say his own house was a haven for illegals," Giuliani counters, accusing the former Massachusetts governor of privately employing undocumented immigrants.
With the Republican base still without a clear favorite, the eight presidential candidates are using the debate on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The self-shot 30-second videos, which Internet users have sent in via YouTube, are little more than catchphrases.
"With this kind of isolationism, we brought Hitler to power," John McCain blames his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one in the room to call for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney, too, gets a strong read from the Vietnam veteran when he refuses to condemn so-called "waterboarding," an interrogation technique that simulates drowning, as torture.
But the reactions of the audience in St. Petersburg, Florida, show that the important issues of the campaign are now beyond the Iraq war and the debates on torture.
Whenever conservative values are exalted and future tax increases are opposed, applause erupts in the auditorium.
It shows once again where the weaknesses of the two favourites lie.
"I was wrong then," Romney declares contritely, apologizing to his base and television audience for being among the abortion advocates in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, falters when asked for his opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf rules in civilian clothes for first time
A day after stepping down as army chief, Pakistan's ruler Musharraf has been sworn in as president.
That brings to an end eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in on Thursday for another five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live from the presidential palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the constitution and act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his post as army chief to his confidante Ashfaq Kiyani, bowing to international pressure, particularly from the United States.
Eight years after seizing power in a bloodless military coup, the former general is now ruling as a civilian leader for the first time.
By resigning as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a core demand of the opposition and the West.
Another key demand is an end to the state of emergency imposed by Musharraf on November 3.
Soon after his swearing-in, Musharraf will lift the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, fulfilling another Western demand.
The country's Supreme Court, which Musharraf filled with lawyers weighing in on him after the imposition of the state of emergency at the beginning of November, last week rejected all appeals against the controversial re-election of the head of state on 6 October.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and four others wounded in an attack on a military convoy in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan.
An army spokesman said the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The Fathers of Krautrock Return
Germany's seventies supergroup is making music again: the three band members of Harmonia took to their consoles again at a concert in Berlin.
The revival will be accompanied by a recording from her heyday, "Live 1974."
Even then, they were far more famous abroad.
The appointed sensation then takes the form of three seated gentlemen at the dinner table.
Everyone has their box in front of them, their cables and, above all, their buttons.
Dieter Moebius is enthroned in the middle in a white shirt at the age of 63.
Flanked on the left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who owns a laptop and guitar.
On the right, viewed from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, bends over in concentration at the console.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it inadvertently blends into a conventional piece of music.
This does not seem to bother the gentlemen much.
The fact that the band Harmonia is playing music again has caused quite a stir among Krautrock lovers.
Whereas we can reveal here: Targeted enquiries revealed that the name whirred through the collective pop memory, but by no means as lasting as missing this band painfully for 32 years.
But why shouldn't the German be allowed to celebrate his living legends from the seventies?
Especially since what is misleadingly called Krautrock has always been more valid in England and America than at home.
When the music industry presented the survivors of the Cologne group Can with the Echo Lifetime Achievement Award in 2003, there were questioning German pop faces in the hall.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in their laudatory speech, the amazement knew no bounds.
At concerts, Michael Rother would later crouch on stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers like an old buddy.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration abroad is one thing.
The memory is already overwhelmed with Harmonia, because the trio only existed for two years and developed a much less effective power during this time than was subsequently assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously performed with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
First they played in the cellar under the Berlin Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label run by the church.
Rother had briefly helped out at Kraftwerk and subsequently gained a reputation as a guitarist with Neu!, perhaps the most radical German group at the time.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed the cluster musicians into exile in Forst in the Weserbergland.
There, in the old Weserhof, a ruin from the 16th century, they lived as communards fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to work as a nanny.
Rather in a pointy-headed artistic existence.
Supposedly, a pennant of the singing association Harmonia Ottenstein and a name for art were also found in the bulky garbage.
Some of it was captured by Harmonia.
The first album was called "Music of Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe."
Because no matter how calm and modest the music sounded, the band suffered material hardship.
Gathering brushwood was not just for self-discovery.
The recently released CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of a record-breaking backdrop of almost 50 people, as someone remembers.
At the time, Rother expressed the desire to push harmony and practice it occasionally.
For Roedelius and Moebius this is an immoral demand.
The band announced their split in 1975.
Rother landed in the esoteric-spherical and secured his existence with albums like "Flaming Hearts."
Cluster was revived in the Eighties and has since been more successful than Harmonia ever was.
The Griessemer live album is thanks to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His record company Greenland has set itself the goal of cultivating Krautrock as a very own German contribution to living music.
New! has already been unearthed like Roedelius "solo work.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the Haus der Kulturen der Welt in Berlin.
Publicly subsidised, as part of the Woldtronics festival.
Julian Cope is here, the Briton, old punk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler."
There is also the inventor of Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
Whereby the entire range of influences of Krautrock on the following pop music would be outlined.
Harmonia fills in the blank of the supergroup.
Brian Eno's sentence floats with the strangest sounds in the hall: "The only true music, the future belongs to you."
There are pictures showing the producer with Harmonia in the farmer's parlor.
Projections of further black-and-white photos of tangled wired devices are used to create legends.
Before that, the three veterans are back to improvising.
No more by gluing microphones to the organ and the drums in order to elicit unheard-of sounds from the instruments via self-made effect devices.
Today electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three tinkerers immersed in the technical field.
The choir of the House does not change this.
Conducted by Barbara Morgenstern, they cough and whisper under clouds of sound and sing "Aaaaaaaah!" in a beautiful place with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never about rock.
The roots were sought less in the blues than in music academies (Can), technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Those who shout "'68!" here are not entirely wrong, and Harmonia will not let this disturb them even now.
Even the most self-evident things are thoroughly considered on stage.
Where does music start and when does it end?
This can rob you of your nerves or bring you fleeting moments of great happiness.
Richard Gere just isn't cynical enough
With "The Hunting Party" and "Murderous Peace," two films again deal with the Balkan War.
But both are unconvincing.
Either the concepts focus too much on action and banging, or they are too touching.
Even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help that.
The good news first: Although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, it is there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian war, that actor Richard Gere has now been found.
We had recently lost sight of the most beautiful man of the Eighties, because too many nicely irrelevant roles in feel-good films for women and too many press conferences on Buddhism made you want to look.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to watch "The Hunting Party - When the Huntsman Becomes the Huntsman" (Why do movie titles always have to be as long and confusing as train driver collective agreements?).
He delivers a wonderfully tongue-in-cheek performance: basically, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become if fate and the film industry were not so gracious: a man who has long since passed his prime, but who, even as a ruinous monument to his decline, has preserved considerable remnants of his former charm.
But despite this trump card, "The Hunting Party," along with the German production "Mörderischer Frieden," which also opens this week, continues only the endless series of failed Balkan war films.
"Murderous Peace" is a short film about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who rescue a Serb woman from Kosovar snipers, whereupon one of them promptly falls in love with her.
Although it is to be welcomed that the Serbs are not portrayed as the sole root of all evil, the TV-flat film gets lost all too quickly in bangers and action.
It remains a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway but with war.
In contrast, "The Hunting Party" is an almost exemplary exploration of why there has never been a really good Balkan war film.
The story of three US war reporters who set out to track down the Serbian war criminal "the fox" might have become a new "Apocalypse Now" at another time, with a different director and a different screenwriter (both in personal union with Richard Shepard).
Because the stories are strikingly similar: both times small teams go into the woods to accomplish something the military cannot do, and both times it becomes a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that Simon Hunt is not simply the down-to-earth cynic we are introduced to at the beginning.
No, on top of that, the script has to ascribe him a romantic affair with a Bosnian Muslim woman who was later murdered.
Finally, "The Hunting Party" goes down the drain when, in the last five minutes of the time-lapse proceedings, the reporters succeed in doing what NATO, the CIA and all the bounty hunters in the world have failed to do in five years: catch the war criminal and hand him over to the Muslim Bosnians for just revenge.
This is so bad that they want to go to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against cinema.
The film has a profoundly human purpose.
He wants to denounce the fact that Karadzic and Mladic are still running free, and he suspects the Americans and the French (they are supposed to agree on this for once) of not pursuing the persecution too intensively on the basis of collusion.
But the well-intentioned and the evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
It says of the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's desk: "Compassionate I see the swollen foreheads, indicating: how exhausting it is to be evil."
Movies like "The Hunting Party" have just such swelling heads, but they hint at how exhausting it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of Balkan war films.
It was recently reported in this newspaper that all of Hollywood's Iraq films were big flops.
You might add that there has never been a good South African film either.
It is almost always true that when a star roams the world's trouble spots or minefields, something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Beyond All Borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blood Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio comes out.
Perhaps all the conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, it had to be decades before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust with "Schindler's List."
Some films will probably still mature - the Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter," "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett," which are now regarded as classics, were by no means unanimously celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But perhaps we now know too much about the world's conflicts, too, given that every mass murder occurs in real time on two screens at home.
And that robs the scriptwriters of the ruthlessness needed to tell good stories.
After all, "To be or not to be" or "The Great Dictator" became so good also because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you don't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
You might have to have the sarcastic detached gaze of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about parallels between his historical novel Lemprière's Dictionary and the Balkan War, he replied: "It's just because some things never change.
Big cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in gruesome ways and there will always be war in Yugoslavia. "
Von Beust draws criticism for Olympic cancellation
The move of the mayor away from Hamburg's bid for the Summer Olympics has met with fierce criticism from politics and business.
Many want to keep fighting for the Games on the water.
But von Beust urges realism in assessing the opportunities.
The chief executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described a waiver on Wednesday as "not good for the business location."
No other project in recent times has developed such great motivating forces in the city as the Olympic idea.
'Without that goal, it wouldn't be possible to sustain the momentum of sports policy to the same extent. '
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach "based on a different timeline."
Mayor Ole von Beust on Wednesday stood by earlier statements that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions were unrealistic, at least until 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on an Olympic bid, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the sports federation, expected at the beginning of December, on Munich's bid for the 2018 Winter Games.
"For us, this preference means that we will not have any realistic chances in the period up to 2028 that we have envisaged so far."
Nevertheless, von Beust said, the dream was not dreamed of for all time.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) regretted Beusts "statements.
This would give the impression that Hamburg no longer wants to bid for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to squander an opportunity by burying the plans already at this stage," said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
A renunciation of the application would also contradict the statement of the head of the Senate at a reception for the General Assembly of the General German University Sports Association.
There von Beust described Hamburg's bid for the 2015 Universiade as "not a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week, the University Sports Association nominated Hamburg as a candidate city.
The SPD parliamentary group accused the Senate of not having used valuable time for housing construction in Hamburg.
"The development of Kleiner Grasbrook has been delayed for years by the Senate because it has put Olympia on the map and excluded housing construction," said SPD members Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD had always called for integrated planning for Olympia and subsequent residential use for Kleiner Grasbrook, the CDU had unilaterally relied on the "event factor."
At the time, the bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics had aroused great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Hamburg, however, had failed against Leipzig.
These are not Warhol's boxes
Anyone who combines the terms Sweden and wooden box thinks of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently, wooden boxes manufactured in Sweden cast a dark shadow over Warhol's catalogue raisonné.
Most of the ninety-four Brillo boxes listed there are "Stockholm type" counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" raised doubts a few months ago about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes from 1968, internal research at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm has now come to a sobering conclusion: the six "Brillo-Boxes," which former museum director Pontus Hultén donated to the Moderna Museet in 1995, are copies - and probably the majority of the approximately one hundred other Brillo boxes of the "Stockholm type" in circulation on the international art market.
The prehistory is nested, a confusing concatenation of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-and-white design of the cardboard boxes of the "Brillo" soap powder.
An exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet in 1968 exhibited - with Warhol's permission - hundreds of Brillo cardboard boxes: these were not from Warhol (for cost reasons), but were delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but their models, mere exhibits.
At the same time, Warhol probably gave permission in 1968 to have a few Brillo wooden boxes produced in Sweden, but these were not exhibited in the Moderna Museet.
Eyewitnesses now speak of around fifteen boxes, which at the time rightly went down in art and auction history as authentic Andy Warhol Brillo boxes with the designation "Stockholm type."
Some of them have fetched more than $100,000 at auction.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that around a hundred wooden boxes were produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, Hultén's 105 boxes were not produced in Malmö until 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time, Warhol had already been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief curator at Moderna Museet, examined the six museum-owned Brillo boxes as well as three privately owned Swedish boxes, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their chipboard was first primed and sanded off, and then white oil paint was applied with a brush.
The structure of the copies from 1990, on the other hand, reveals that the paint was applied directly to the chipboard with a paint roller without a primer - in addition, it is not an oil paint, but an acrylic paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes," says the director of Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "Unless the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York comes to a different conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies / exhibition material."
Back in July, however, the authentication board announced it would investigate the "serious allegations" made about the soap powder boxes.
But since then, there has been an unrelenting silence.
Rebellious soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who had barricaded themselves in a hotel in Manila and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo have given up.
He cannot be blamed for bloodshed, leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters at the hotel.
Soldiers loyal to the government had earlier stormed the hotel using tear gas.
The two dozen or so soldiers had been holed up in the building for hours.
Around half of them - including Trillanes - were on trial on Thursday for a failed coup attempt in 2003.
He used the trial to suddenly break away with around 30 sympathisers.
The military policemen who were supposed to guard him had apparently defected to him and joined his mutiny.
They broke into the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the ouster of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government forces cordoned off the area around the upscale hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the soldiers' actions.
"People have had enough," Trillanes said.
'We're calling on people to join us. '
Gen. Danilo Lim, who once commanded the elite Scout Rangers unit, said other army units would join the march soon.
Government critics had called for large demonstrations against the president on Friday.
Her government has been dogged for months by allegations of corruption.
Manila's financial district was the scene of an attempted mutiny against Arroyo by about 200 military personnel in 2003.
The uprising collapsed after barely 24 hours because of the army's refusal to join.
There have been at least seven attempted coups against democratically elected governments in the Philippines since 1986.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder in Versatel
United Internet has secured a stake of more than 20 percent in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, the company announced on Wednesday evening.
It now holds 20.05 percent of the share capital.
There had previously been speculation about a takeover.
One keeps the option open to increase the share of Versatel still.
The move is aimed at accelerating the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet said.
Earlier on Wednesday, speculation about a takeover had already arisen after Berenberg Bank increased its stake in the Düsseldorf-based network operator by a further 5 per cent to 15.1 per cent.
The money house holds the shares only for a third party, it was reported in the financial market.
The day before, United Internet had already acquired just under 10 percent of the mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch has placed 17.4 million new shares with a value of 106.4 million euros.
United Internet bought 5.15 million shares for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies have entered into discussions on marketing co-operations for DSL and mobile products.
"We are strengthening our partnership," a United spokesman said.
The two companies created the MSP joint venture to acquire competitor Freenet.
For the time being, the two companies want to be satisfied with a good ten percent stake in Freenet and do not want to make use of their right to acquire a further 18.49 percent stake in Freenet, United Internet announced on Thursday.
However, the two companies kept all options open, in particular to further increase their shareholding in Freenet AG, it was reported.
Talks between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had ended in mid-November.
The poker around Freenet, which has been going on for months and is difficult to understand, is part of the consolidation of the German telecoms market.
Freenet had 2.9 million mobile subscribers and 1.27 million DSL and full-line subscribers at the end of the third quarter.
The holding company of United Internet and Drillisch previously directly held 6.01 percent of the Freenet shares.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch will contribute a further four percent.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent stake from the investment company Vatas had already been agreed in August.
