This not only confirms that at least some of the dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as their color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Researchers say that the animal's wings were brown on top with a light or carrot-colored underside.
The find also provides information on the evolution of wing in birds.
Because dinosaur wings lack a fully developed shaft, called a tail, but have other features of feathers - "muscles and tails" - researchers concluded that the tail was likely a later evolutionary development than the other features.
The structure of the wings suggests that they were not used for flight but for temperature control or display, and scientists contend that although this is a tail from a young dinosaur, the specimen reveals adult plumage and not juvenile plumage.
The researchers say that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen suggests the folding of an adult rather than a baby.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty people.

They discovered that the Sun operated on the same basic principles that other stars were based on: it was found that the activity of all the stars in the system was guided by their brightness, their rotation and nothing else.
The luminosity and rotation are calculated together to define a star's Rosby number, which is related to the flow of plasma.
The star is so inactive in relation to magnetic reversals, the smaller the Rossby number.

The part of the work that was completed was mainly theoretical, however the program was designed to represent observations of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
What the team anticipated would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's counterpart.
Just as the moon exerts a pull on the earth, creating tides, so does the Milky Way exert a pull on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to infer that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter found in a galaxy is trapped around the galaxy, forming a kind of corona, and is made up of many small particles.
TV reports indicate white smoke emanating from the station.

Dr. Tony Moll has discovered XDR-TB in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview he said that the new mutation was "a cause of great concern because of its high mortality rate".
Dr. Moll believes that some patients may have been infected with the virus at the hospital, and at least two of them were health care workers at the hospital.
In a year, a person who is infected can infect 10 to 15 of his close associates.
However, the rate of hyper-resistant TB in the entire group of people with TB appears to be still low, at 6,000 out of the total of 330,000 people infected at any one time in South Africa.

It's colder by day relative to the surrounding surface and warmer by night.
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of large caves on Earth, which often maintain a relatively constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that these are deep holes in the ground", said Glenn Cousin of the astrogeological team at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the University of Northern Arizona in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, elections have always been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a shed and put in an envelope a pre-printed sheet of paper listing the candidate of their choice.
After the officials verify the identity of the voter, he drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voters' list.
The procedure is codified very strictly by the French electoral law.
Since 1988, voters have had to be visible in order to enable voters and witnesses to certify that no files were present at the beginning of the voting and that no files were entered in addition to those which had been legally counted and those of the registered voters.
Candidates can send representatives to observe each part of the process. Late in the afternoon, votes are counted by volunteers, under strict supervision, who follow specific procedures.

Four skiers from the women's sitting ski class were unable to complete their routes, while 45 of the 117 total skiers in the Giant Slalom failed to qualify for the race.
The Madhya Pradesh Police have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said: We have arrested five persons who raped the Swiss woman and we have recovered her mobile phone and laptop.
The accused are Baba Kanjar, Botha Kanjar, Rambhu Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police chief Chandra Sekar Solanki said the accused appeared in court wearing face coverings.
Although three people were inside the house when the car crashed, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered a serious head injury.
The accident road was temporarily closed as emergency services were removing the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He then went to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Antecoi has since been charged by the High Court of Edinburgh with the murder of her son.
She's in custody with an indictment and a trial pending, but any eyewitness evidence may have been affected as her image has been widely publicized.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but justice in Scotland works differently and the courts have ruled that the publication of photos is potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee reports that journalists seem to be waiting in line if they publish photos etc. of suspects.
The prosecutor's office, which is generally responsible for prosecutions, has informed reporters that there will be no further comment at least until charges are laid.
According to leaked information, the document will address the border dispute that Palestine wants based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Reportedly, among other issues covered were the future status of Jerusalem, which is a holy place for both states, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to allow such a presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplementary pest control test would be under close supervision by the rangers as the test would be tested and its effectiveness assessed.
In cooperation with the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and the Scouting Federation of Australia (NSW), volunteer experts were recruited as part of the Scouting Federation's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, General Manager of Parks Conservation and Heritage for the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the four shooters selected for the first hunting operation received detailed safety and training instructions.
Yesterday Martelly was sworn into a new Interim Electoral Council (IEC) consisting of nine members.
This is the fifth provisional election board for Martelli in four years.
Last month a presidential commission proposed the previous resignation of the Provisional Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to lead the country to new elections.
The committee was Martelli's response to the widespread anti-government demonstrations that began in October.
Some violent protests have been held over the lack of elections, some of which have been pending since 2011.
Based on official reports, there were about 60 cases of iPod malfunctions that resulted in high temperatures, starting six fires and leaving four people with minor injuries from the fire.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay in the report "really regrettable".
The quake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. Greenwich time Friday).
The Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management said there were no reports of damage on their territory.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A Filipino ex-police officer has caught hostages of Hong Kong visitors hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of his country.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are now confirmed dead.
Six of the hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early; so were the photographers from the Philippines.
The photographers later replaced an elderly lady who needed to use the toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and chose a career in medicine.
He trained and became a gynaecologist, starting work in 1959 at the State Women's Clinic, Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins, in his spare time, began researching preterm birth.
According to his research, if a hormone was given, the fetal lung would mature.
Xinhua said government investigators on Wednesday located two black box flight data recorders.
The fellow fighters paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first winner of the Queen of Extreme competition. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Unique as herself. Powerful woman".
Dustin Goldstein Runnels commented that Luna was as weird as I am... maybe even more so... I love her and will miss her... I hope she's in a better place.
Of the 1,400 people who took part in the poll ahead of the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a democracy have increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a crownless republic when Queen Elizabeth II's reign ends.
34 percent of those who took part in the poll agreed with this idea, because they want Queen Elizabeth V to be the last monarch of Australia.
Looking at both ends of the poll, 29% of all respondents believe Australia should become a republic without a monarchy as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic without a monarchy.
The Olympic gold medallist was expected to compete in the 100 and 200 freestyle and three swimming events at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his discomfort his fitness is in question.
She couldn't take the medication she needed to stop the pain because it's banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, on January 25 discovered the largest prime number ever found.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water transport to Earth as well as organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, as comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, who is 53, became governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He was referred to in the rumours as "political gossip and nonsense".
He's expected to run for president in 2016.
The Federal Aviation Administration claims that the new generation air transport system would allow airplanes to fly shorter routes, save gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
The technology it uses is satellite-based, as opposed to older ground-based radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately locate an aircraft and give more accurate information to pilots.
No additional transport is carried out and the underground railways will not stop at Wembley.
Fears of a lack of transportation raise the possibility that the match will be held behind closed doors, without the team's fans.
A study reported Thursday in Science has spoken of the existence of a new type of bird in the Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved within just two generations, although the process is thought to have taken much longer due to the breeding between the endemic Darwin's spider of the genus Geospiza fortes and the migratory spider of the genus Geospiza contris.
Gold can be carved into any shape, and shaped into shapes of the smallest size.
It can be carved into thin wire, then twisted and braided. It can be forged or wrapped in leaves.
It can be made so thin that it would stick to other metals, and it can be made so thin that it was sometimes used as decoration in hand-made book illustrations called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an index using red cabbage juice.
The color of the cabbage juice changes according to the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) of the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that no longer have their own electrons (as a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Stir the two dry powders together and then, with clean, wet hands, press them into a ball.
The moisture in your palms will react with the outer covering, creating a strange sensation and creating a peel-like effect.
The cities of Harapa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet with a water-filled bowl for each dwelling, connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
Also, in Greece, in the habitations of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, ruins of drainage systems have been found.
Toilets also appeared in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. Toilets in Rome were often part of the public baths, where all of the sexes were a mixed crowd.
When you call someone who's far away, it uses a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then sends it back to earth almost instantly.
The satellite was launched by a rocket, and scientists have space telescopes because our planet's atmosphere is altering our light and visibility.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet high to send a satellite or a telescope into space.
The contribution of the wheel to the world is amazing, but the most important of all is the simplest and fastest way to get around.
Thanks to him, we have trains, cars, and many other transportation machinery.
Below them are cats of more medium size that feed on medium-sized game from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
After all, there are many predatory kittens (including free-ranging domestic cats) that prey on the many animals, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the idea of position, a special role each cat has, that prevents competition between them.
Lions are the most social of the cats, as they live in large groups called herds.
The flocks consist of one to three adult males related to each other, along with up to thirty females with their young.
Females usually have a close bond with each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds act much like wolf or dog packs, animals that are strikingly similar to lions (but not other large cats) in behavior, and are also extremely deadly to their prey.
The tiger, as a complete athlete, can climb (not at a very good level), swim, make huge leaps and put five times as much force into lifting as a strong man.
The tiger is in the same category (genus Pantheriina) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four are the only cats that can bark.
The tiger's roar is not like the loud roar of a lion, but it is more like a phrase than angry, loud words.
The oseloth prefers small animals, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and even birds, almost all of the animals the oseloth hunts are smaller than the oseloth.
Scientists believe that the snelots track and find animals to feed (hunt) by sniffing, smelling the ground to see where they are.
They are very good at the dark through night vision and move silently, the oseloths hunt their prey through adaptation to their environment and then sudden attack on their prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) separates from the main population from which it came (for example if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return) they will often encounter a different environment than in the past.
This new environment has new resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor compared to what was required in the past.
The indigenous people have not changed at all, the same adaptations need to be made as in the past.
As time passes, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, the similarities to the rest of the population become smaller and smaller.
At some point, after thousands or perhaps millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be considered the same species.
This process is called pseudogenesis, which means the formation of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants create their food from the sun through photosynthesis.
Our homes and our clothes are made from plants, the food we eat is mostly plants, and without plants, animal survival would be impossible.
Mossaurus was the top predator of his time, so he was afraid of nothing but other Mossaurus.
Its long jaws had over 70 razor-sharp teeth combined with an extra row of teeth at the top of its mouth, indicating that there was no escape for anything that passed its way.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a split tongue, fed on turtles, big fish, other molasses, and may have been a cannibal.
It attacked anything that entered the water, and even the giant dinosaur, Tyrannosaurus, would not have been able to compete with it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans also had a variety of strange or unusual festive foods, including the following, wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called glyrids.
Another difference was that the poor and women ate their meals sitting in chairs, while the rich men preferred to eat at banquets where they could relax in their company while dining.
Meals in ancient Rome could not have contained foods that reached Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, there was no corn, tomato, potato, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever eaten turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a primordial temple that was considered the house of the god.
The people would sacrifice to the deities, and the clergy would try to meet the deities' wishes by organizing rites and feasts.
In each temple there is an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only the priests have access to.
Sometimes they built certain towers in a pyramid shape called ziggurats, and they were part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm Middle Eastern climate, the roof was not so important.
The Jewish family spent most of its life in the countryside.
Women cooked in the courtyard, while shops were open benches facing the street, and stone was used as building material.
The land of Canaan lacked large areas of forest, so wood was very expensive.
In the Norse sagas, Erik the Red is said to have been banished from Iceland for murder and, as he traveled west, found Greenland and gave it that name.
However, despite its discovery, the Eskimos were already living there at this time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland were very different.
If you have seen the movie In Search of Lost Treasure, you may think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence there is a treasure map written.
Although there is an inscription on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence was written the following: "Original Declaration of Independence issued July 4, 1776". This is written below, in reverse.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that from the beginning the large parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches) was wrapped for storage.
Therefore, the footnote may have been added merely as a highlight.
The Normandy landings and the battles that followed liberated the French North, but the South was still not free.
It was run by the Vichy government, which consisted of Frenchmen who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and were cooperating with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; this raid was called Operation Dragon.
Within two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated the south of France and Germany was next.
Culture is a unique tradition shared by a large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, which is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and this in turn describes the size of society.
Cities-states are the ancestors of states. A cultural culture involves the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, in a continuous cultural imprint and a sublime diffusion.
Often, smaller civilizations disappear without leaving behind relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as normal civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states initially created a powerless central government - with Congress being the sole constituent - based on the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and because there was no executive or judicial power, it relied on state authorities, which were not cooperative, to enforce all laws.
Furthermore, he had no jurisdiction to overlook the laws of taxation and customs between the states.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended, but the states took the government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The national football teams of Italy and Germany are the second most successful teams in the world and were the champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the Nordic countries, with Italians participating in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh largest island on earth!
Due to Japan's island cluster, the latter is often referred to as the "Archipelago" from a geographical point of view.
The origin of Taiwan is lost in the past, in the 15th century, when passing European sailors named the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan and began a transformation in the practices by which native grains were produced, employing Chinese workers in the rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) dominated western and northern Taiwan, which they made an administrative district of their empire in 1885.
After losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1984-1985), the Qing Dynasty then signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which allowed Taiwan to remain under Japanese control until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Idiwatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room with the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings in the complex have been built from scratch in order to give tourists a better idea of what they looked like originally.
30% of Matsu Pitsou had been restored by 1976 and its restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common form of still image photography is 35 mm worldwide, which was the most prevalent film size in the late analog film era.
It's still produced today, but the most important aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor shapes of the digital camera.
The 35mm font is actually 36mm wide, which is confusing, and 24mm high.
The ratio of the dimensions of this arrangement (divided by twelve to get the simplest ratio of integers) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS class of formats, for example) equal or closely approximate these aspect ratios.
The rule of three, which is often subject to abuse and ridicule, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining order to a meter in a picture.
It states that the most effective point for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, now possessing wealth and power, was brought under control.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has created unbreakable bonds between the European states despite any differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone, from kings to common mortals.
One of Christianity's main beliefs is that wealth should be used to relieve the poor and suffering, and the churches' funds are raised specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led many to question whether the doctrine was being properly implemented.
Great Britain began blocking Germany by sea, immediately after the beginning of the attacks.
The strategy has been effective, with cuts in vital military and civilian supplies, despite the blockade violating generally accepted international law, codified in various international agreements over the last two centuries.
The United Kingdom has placed mines in international waters to prevent the movement of ships in any part of the sea, threatening even neutral ships.
As there was little response to this tactic, Germany expected the same from its unrestrained submarine warfare.
During the 1920's, the attitude adopted by most citizens and nations was one of peace and isolation.
The nations, after seeing the horrors and savagery of war during World War I, wanted to avoid a repetition of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take a job with the Edison Company.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (a manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of differentiating each distinct period of time, each stage of China or each ruling family was a distinct dynasty.
Among each dynasty there was also a volatile era of divided provinces, the most famous of these periods being the Three Kingdoms period that lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
At that time, there was a fierce warfare between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, as thousands of people lost their lives fighting for the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
The social and political consequences are many and include the use of the metric system, a shift from authoritarianism to democracy, patriotism and the belief that the country does not belong to one ruler, but to all the people.
Also, after the Revolution, professions were open to all men seeking work, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same was true of the army, as instead of ranking by category, it was now by division.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed individuals of the working classes of other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was keenly interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He often visited a cave that became known as Hira on the mountain Nur (light) for meditation.
The cave itself, where he survived through time, provides a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual calling.
The cave is isolated from the world as it is located on the edge of a hill north of Mecca.
In fact, it's not easy for anyone to find it even if they know it exists.
Nothing is visible beyond the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains, and very little of this world is visible or audible from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many large pyramid-shaped structures built to honor dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "City of Giza" located in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, has several pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), a few small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of the pharaoh Heopus, and many of the smaller pyramids, as well as the smaller tombs and temples, were built in honor of Heopus' wife and family members.
The sign indicating that the boom should move upwards looks like a V and the sign indicating that the boom should move downwards looks like a seam or square without its underside.
Playing up means that you have to start from the edge, pushing the pole, and playing down means that you have to start from the frog (the place where your hand holds the pole) and pull it.
Playing the bow upwards produces a softer sound, while playing it downwards is louder and more powerful.
You are free to put your own markings, but keep in mind that the ones that exist do perform some musical function, so they often need to be taken into account.
On 6 October 1789, a mob of market women forced King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Thérèse, eleven, and Louis Charles, four) and the king's sister, Lady Elisabeth, who had been terrorized, to return from Versailles to Paris.
They rode back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a mob of people shouting and threatening the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the windows of their carriage wide.
At one point, a man in the crowd began waving the head of a member of the royal guard who was killed at Versailles, right in front of the terrified queen.
The expenses of the United States' imperialist war for the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover a large part of the costs and the bond rate was being manipulated on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the superprofits that resulted from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people were to be the main profits of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights, one must understand the context that prompted the creation of the order.
The time when these events took place is often referred to as the Late Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1,000-11,300 AD).
The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and preceded the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological rationalism is a term that encompasses a variety of ideas in practice, from the promotion or enforcement of technology, to the strict interpretation that the future of humanity is governed by an underlying logic directly connected to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two central ideas: that technology development in itself follows a path largely outside of cultural and political influence and that technology in turn influences societies inherently, rather than societies adapted to the present.
For example, one might argue that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for a small number of vehicles, so new production methods are being developed to reduce car ownership costs.
The collective ownership regime also leads to higher rates of road accidents, which in turn lead to new methods in health care for the repair of bodily injuries.
Romanticism had an important element of cultural determinism, coming from writers such as Goethe, Ficte and Schlegel.
In the Romantic world, geography shaped people, and over time customs and cultural elements related to this geography emerged, which, being in harmony with the position of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is considered the source of style in the modern era, so Constantinople is the corresponding European source in the feudal era.
Its reputation as a center of plenty began to spread about A.D. 400 and lasted until about A.D. 1100.
Its prestige declined in the twelfth century, largely because the Crusaders brought back materials such as silk and spices, which were of higher value than the products of Byzantine markets.
It was then that the title of the Capital of Fashion was transferred from Istanbul to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its zenith in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries, as well as in the 14th century.
Early dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, slow communication channels resulted in 25 to 30 years of delay in technology in the West.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the most important developments of the era, which came as a result of the Crusades, was that people began to fasten their clothes with buttons.
Maintenance farming is farming that is carried out to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family alone.
Survival agriculture is a simple, usually biological system of using stored seeds originating in the local ecosystem, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Traditionally, farmers were mostly self-sufficient, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel marginalized by societal norms, enabling them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are divided by age, origin, social class, location and/or race.
The qualities of a subculture that make it distinctive may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
To mark their identity, members of a subculture often adopt a characteristic and symbolic style, which includes various fashions, peculiar attitudes, and slang.
A key technique for meaningful socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, bad luck, or abuse, were not socialized with adults during their lifetime.
Some of these children have been abandoned by humans, usually by their parents themselves, in some cases due to parental rejection due to severe mental or physical disability.
Wild children are likely to have experienced severe abuse or traumatic experiences before they are abandoned or before they run away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are supposed to have lived alone in the wild.
A feral child, when raised entirely by animals without any contact with humans, exhibits behaviors (within natural limits) that almost exactly resemble those of the particular animal that raised it, such as fear or indifference toward humans.
While task-based teaching makes learning easier and more interesting, assistive devices go one step further.
The curriculum is not a way of learning but rather a handy tool for people undergoing a new teaching experience, such as learning a new computer program or starting a new project.
There are virtual and real curse words, in other words, the teacher is a form of curse word, but the same is true for the Microsoft Office linker.
Virtual assistants are embedded in software and are intended to ask, promote and explain processes that may have been very difficult for students to handle.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect and abuse to even blackmail.
No child should ever grow up in an environment without care, love and education, but it happens.
We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and affordable health care.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the needs that the child did not receive in the home from which he was removed.
The Internet includes elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet result in additional dimensions in the approach to uses and rewards.
For example, 'learning' and 'socializing' are considered important motives for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and Continuous relationships were also identified as aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) in their research of audience reactions to websites.
Videography has helped make important discoveries in understanding microscopic expressions, our expressions that hold up to the tiniest of things.
In particular, it is said that one can detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting the small expressions.
Oliver Sacks in his essay "The President's Speech" states that people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to discern sincerity with accuracy.
It is further thought that these abilities in how to understand human behavior are exhibited in animals such as domestic dogs.
A twentieth-century study showed that there are two forms of genetic diversity, latent and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variants and selection subtracts them from the pool of expressed variants.
Distinction and mixing redistribute the diversity between the two sides in each family.
Out on the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its need for amino acids from available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so had serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The most readily accessible plant resources would be proteins that can be accessed by leaves and algae, but are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
On the contrary, animal foods (ant, termites, eggs) are not only digestible but are also important sources of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
Given all the evidence, it's not surprising that our ancestors faced the protein issue the way chimpanzees in the savanna do now.
Sleep interruption is the process where you wake up consciously during your normal sleep interval and fall back asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock so that you regain consciousness without waking up completely.
If you catch yourself turning off the alarm clock while you sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room so that you have to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic effect) before bedtime, to force the patient to stand up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace that a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of stress on their body and mind.
The less pressure, the better the life force is present, and each individual has the ability to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only obstacles to that goal are the tension and negativity in each of us.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it was expanded from the path of love of mahayana and from many techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism, at its very core, is very simple, it consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of love that embraces all.
In Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini (illumination) energy is awakened by movements, inhalation and exhalation practices, mantras and visualizations.
The focus of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yoga. Through the vision of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakas are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the U.S. At the end of the war, conflicts at the level of systems, processes and culture led to the two countries' breakdown.
As two years had passed since the war ended, the former allies were enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for 40 years and have proxy wars, in battle zones from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, Poland's defenses had already been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup at the Romanian outpost.
However, these plans were rendered useless almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and formed the Belarusian Front and the Ukrainian Front, having invaded the eastern territories of Poland in violation of the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Non-Aggression Pact between the Soviet Union and Poland, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way of transporting large sections of the population and goods across the oceans.
The job of the Navy has long been to ensure that your country can transport your own people and goods, while preventing your enemy from transporting theirs and their goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, when the Americans were trying to get men and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using submarines in particular, was trying to disrupt this traffic.
If the Allies failed, the Germans could in all probability conquer Britain as they did the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes begin to keep them for easy access to milk, wool, meat and skin.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed hills or other pastures, often tended by shepherds who were usually children or teenagers, equivalent to the more widely known shepherds.
Log rails were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wooden rails consisted only of parallel wooden planks, these allowed the horses pulling the wagons to achieve greater speeds and to pull larger loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the day.
Wooden rail ties appeared early enough to hold railroad tracks in place, but gradually it became apparent that the tracks would be much more functional with an iron support at the top.
This was a common method, but iron created more wear on the wheels of wooden carriages.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767 the first purely iron railways appeared.
The first known means of transportation was walking, and humans started walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (which means "upright man").
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as is customary.
Evidence of bipedal movement has been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although the Sahel-man may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We have the ability to live more sustainable lives, to join the environmental movement, and perhaps to take some activist action to somehow limit the problems of the future.
It's like treating symptoms in many cases, but in case we don't want a temporary fix, we'll have to find the source of the issues and neutralize them.
It is quite evident that the world has changed a great deal because of mankind's scientific and technological achievements, and that problems have been increased by overpopulation and wasteful living.
After it was approved by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten memo signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing plant.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies of what are now known as the Dunlap Brochures were printed.
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon on July 8 in the outdoor area of Independence Hall.
A copy was sent on July 6 to George Washington, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9, another arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap pamphlets that we know of are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists now believe that one species of dinosaur has survived to this day, and that is birds.
They are not seen in the dinosaur category by many because they have fins and the ability to fly.
But there are many things about birds that make them look like dinosaurs.
They have scaly legs and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on two legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Computers are now based on the management of information encoded in binary form.
To use computer terminology, a binary number can only take one or two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal intoxication may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are sufficiently common that a direct diagnosis is not possible.
The most telling sign that someone has been poisoned internally is an open bottle of medicine or some toxic household chemical on the premises.
Read the label for specific first-aid instructions for this particular poison.
The term correa is officially used by etymologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from the familiarity of the ancients with bedbugs, which were insects that readily adapted to visiting humans.
The insect-killer and the bug are nest-dwellers, adapted to live in the nest or enclosure of their host.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological condition among young and middle-aged people.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research shows that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
Two partners may decide that raising an infant is not in their best interests or in the best interests of the child they have.
These couples can plan an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The basic goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, and the scientific method actually directs most scientific research.
But there is more to experimentation, and experimentation is a test conducted to disprove one or more possible hypotheses, and asking questions and observing also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and specifically on the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on scientific matters, including psychology, were widely accepted.
As Greek intellectuals lost ground, the West was cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have noted that frequently the rhythms occurring in physiology and behavior are dependent on the existence of endogenous cycles, as well as their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic signals, have been recorded for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators, continuing their cyclic function indefinitely even when they have no external stimuli.
Hersey and Chase's experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase took phages, or microbes, so they could put their genetic material into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments in which they marked either the DNA in the phage using radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein using radioactive sulfur.
Mutations may produce a wide variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the role of the part of the genetic material affected by the mutation, and whether the cells affected are stem cells.
Only mutations in stem cells can be passed on to offspring, as mutations in other cells can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who seek natural landscapes to enjoy nature, along with the wild flora and fauna of the area.
Examples of activities in a given location are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks, as well as studying information concerning the ecosystem.
For example, some visit, photograph, and learn about the Bornean orangutans.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to their workplace and meet others whose work destination is the place from which the first ones just left.
In dynamic shuttle transport, everyone is connected to each other in some way and supports a transport system based on private vehicles.
Today, science shows that this huge carbon economy has taken the biosphere out of a steady state that has supported the evolution of the human species over the last two million years.
Every individual participates in society and uses some transportation system, and almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges are rarely heard at the same level.
Why do transportation systems cause such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more substantial at work?
Traffic Flow is the analysis of the traffic of specific drivers and cars between two places and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, studying the flow of traffic is not easy, as it is impossible to predict with complete certainty the behaviour of drivers.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a range of reasonable consequence; thus, traffic flows tend to have some logical consequence and can be approximated by mathematical representation.
To better represent traffic intensity, relationships have been established between three main characteristics: (1) intensity, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships have helped in the preparation, design and operation of road network facilities.
The first animals to take off were insects, whose ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backward along their body.
This provides them with a greater variety of small hiding places than predators.
Furthermore, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and elapid moths.
Many years ago, Aristarchus mentioned that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some believed that he was right, but many thought the opposite, that the Solar System revolved around the Earth and the Sun (and even other stars).
It makes sense, since the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on the planet, carrying over eight times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, sometimes reaching six miles.
20% of the water that the Earth's rivers discharge into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, and it gathers water from thousands of smaller rivers.
While the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, none surpassed the Giza pyramids in size and technical perfection in construction.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom era were impressed by the monuments of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old.
Vatican City, with a population of about 800, is the smallest independent state in the world and the one with the smallest population.
The Vatican uses Italian in legislation and in official communications.
Italian is also used in everyday life by most people working for the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Man has known about the existence of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as all of these are found in nature in their raw form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle held that all things are created by the combination of one or more of the four elements, earth, water, air, and fire.
He mostly looked like the 4 forms of matter (in that order): solids, liquids, air and plasma, though he also assumed that they changed into new substances to form this presence.
Remember, there are many chemical elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals.
There are also alloys containing small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of very small particles, atoms.
The size of the atoms is so extremely small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, when lead was introduced, it became a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods have emerged, the pencil has been degraded in its place and usefulness.
People now type messages on computer screens without ever having to pick up a scissors.
One might wonder what will become of the keyboard when something new appears.
The fission bomb is based on the principle that energy is required to form a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pulling a heavy wheelbarrow up a hill, and then breaking through the core again, releasing some of that energy.
Some individuals have unstable nuclei, and this leads to their breaking if little or no pressure is applied.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust, and the outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 43 miles [70 km] thick on the near side and about 60 miles [100 km] on the far side.
It's thinner under the seas and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more sea nearby because the crust is thinner, and the lava could better go to the surface.
Content theories focus on figuring out what makes people click or what attracts them.
These theories hold that individuals have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature and reach adulthood.
These theories study what makes certain people want what they want and what's in their environment that will drive them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two factor theory.
In general, two behaviours can occur when managers start mentoring their former peers: one end of the spectrum is to try to remain as 'one of the kids' (or one).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, carrying out evaluations, assigning responsibilities and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you can turn into an unknown person who feels that he or she has to change everything that the group has done and make it their own.
After all, the one who is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team is the leader.
This behavior often results in a rift between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual groups are created with the same integrity principles as conventional groups, however there are minor differences.
Virtual team members often act as a link to their immediate physical team.
Often, they are more autonomous than conventional group members, as their groups may meet according to different time zones, which may not be acceptable to their local administration.
The existence of a truly invisible group (Larson and La Fasta, 1989, p. 109) is another unique element of a virtual group.
Each participant is presented to the invisible management team, which sets the standards for all participants.
Why would an organisation want to go through this time-consuming process of establishing the learning of organisational capabilities? One of the goals for the practical application of the concepts of learning organisational capabilities is innovation.
Creativity and intelligence are fostered when all available resources in the functional departments of an organisation are used appropriately.
As a result, the process in which an organisation works together to overcome a hurdle can lead to new innovative processes to serve the needs of the customer.
In order for an organisation to be innovative, management must create an environment of innovation, knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
Anhel's (2006) explanation of the continuous learning approach describes it as a method used to help organizations increase their level of performance.
Neurobiological evidence provides physical evidence for a theoretical study of cognition, so it narrows the scope of the research by making it more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is a help to researchers and their study.
It's been known for a long time that various types of brain damage, injuries, injuries and tumors affect behavior and may cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that humans have never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to create simulation models that will help us understand the processes that are going on in our minds.
Although AI is largely science fiction, it is nevertheless an important branch of computer science that deals with the adaptation of behavior, learning and intelligence to a machine.
Research in artificial intelligence involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
Examples include control, programming, responding to diagnoses and customer queries, but also handwriting recognition, speech recognition, and facial recognition.
These are now separate authorities, which focus on providing solutions to real problems of everyday life.
AI systems are now commonly used in finance, healthcare, engineering, and the military, and are even embedded in various home computer software applications and cyber games.
Excursions are an important part of any classroom, and very often a teacher would like to take his students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology offers the solution with virtual tours, where students can see museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful artwork while in their classroom.
In fact, taking part in an excursion is also an important opportunity to reflect on the trip and to share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from North Carolina's Bennet School design a website about their trip to the state's capital, and every year it is updated, but the old versions are kept online and serve as a notebook.
Blogs can also help improve a student's writing style. While students' experience with blogs often starts with poor grammar and spelling, audience presence generally changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to work on improving his writing style to avoid criticism.
Also, participating in blogs "forces students to become more understanding about the world around them". The need to maintain the interest of the public inspires students to become intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The management of a website is a technique that promotes teamwork and encourages students to learn more than what they are taught in school in the morning.
Proper use of blogs can encourage students to use more analytical and critical thinking, as through active response to online material, students can define their positions within the context of other people's texts, as well as express their own views on specific topics (Oravek, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, and it includes a wide range of galleries and museums that showcase old and modern Canada.
Further south are Niagara Falls and further north is the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these and more characterize Ontario as the quintessential Canadian character as perceived by foreigners.
Large areas in the still northern part are quite sparsely populated, while some are almost uninhabited wildlife areas.
For a population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadians.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and is a continent in its own right in terms of its wildlife species.
Almost all the islets are self-governing or of French origin, and they are famous for providing lush marine sanctuaries.
The Arabs also brought Islam with them to the region and this extended largely to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama traced the route from Europe to India that bypasses the Cape of Good Hope.
The area is bounded to the north by the Sahel, while the Atlantic Ocean encircles it to the south and west of the site.
Women: It is recommended that any woman travelling should declare herself married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive.
Women need to understand that habits that differ in culture can amount to acts that would be considered harassment and it is not uncommon to go behind them, to hold their hand and so on.
Be firm in your rejection of a man and do not be afraid to defend your position (cultural differences or not, it is not an excuse!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E. and became a strategic port for the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Merenids, who gave it the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city and named it Darou I-Batija, while the name Casablanca was given by Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
It's easy to find places around the old Medina selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tadjis, ceramics, leather goods, nard and a wide range of beads, but they're all tourist-oriented.
Goma is a city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo with a high tourist traffic in the eastern extremity near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by the Nyiragongo volcano, whose lava covered almost all the streets of the city, especially its center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside Goma should be considered in order to understand the state of the ongoing conflict in North Kivu province.
The town is also a base for climbing on the Niagara volcano along with some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking and observation programs in Africa.
You can use the boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. Usually the price (local) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Coupled with its relative inaccessibility, "Tibet" has acquired the metaphorical meaning of an exotic, distant country.
Today, Timbuktu is a poverty-stricken town, despite its reputation as a tourist attraction and its airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, because it is threatened by desert sand.
This is one of the most important stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special on the Wonders of the African World.
The city is completely different from the other cities in the country, as it has a predominantly Arab air rather than African air.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the northern and eastern part of South Africa and is located on the border line of Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, and the Crocodile River in the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecological areas, each supporting different species of wildlife.
It is one of the most notable attractions in South Africa and is referred to as the emblem of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are daily maintenance entrance tickets to the park.
It may be beneficial for someone to purchase a Wild Card, which grants entry either to selected South African parks or to all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the name of the territory of Hong Kong and is a magnet for many visitors.
The splendor of the buildings that form Hong Kong's urban panorama has been likened to a brilliant bar chart that is highlighted by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For a better view of Hong Kong, leave the island and go across to the Kaohsiung harbor.
The urban development of Hong Kong Island is for the most part concentrated in high density in arid areas along the northern coast.
This is the place where the British colonists occupied, and so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, it's a good place to start.
Sundarbone is the largest coastal mangrove forest zone in the world, stretching 80 km into the continental part of Bangladesh and India from the coast.
The Sandarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the part of the forest that lies on Indian soil is called the Sandarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps, however, but they include some of the last remnants of the mighty jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundorbon covers an area of 3,850 square kilometres of which about one third is covered by water/oil zones.
Since 1966, Sudorbon has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-regional station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and towards Jakarta/Bumalang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Because buses between the districts are usually full, it is suggested that you get your ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are noted for their comfort and durability.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 n.w.t.) and Punaha (200 n.w.t.).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, 378 meters long, and have two corridors 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (55 ft).[citation needed] The completion of the bridge took place in August 2011 and it was closed to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group inhabiting the territories now known as eastern Paraguay, and lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also engaged in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco area was home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaicuru and the Paihua, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called the "Great Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the conflict between the Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a three-century colonial period.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its native character and identity.
Argentina is renowned for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The main tournament is held annually in the last month of the year at the Las Cañitas water polo pools.
Here you can watch smaller tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
For news about the tournaments and ticketing points for water polo matches, check out the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands pound (FKP), the value of which is equal to the value of the British pound sterling (GBP).
You can make a currency exchange at the islands' only bank which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere in the islands and Stanley credit cards as well as US dollars are commonly accepted.
In remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted; ask the owners beforehand to find out what methods of payment are accepted.
It is almost impossible to convert Falkland currency outside the islands, so you do a currency conversion before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer when the northern hemisphere is winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone, and in summer, temperatures above 30 °C are common.
The cold of winter is deceptive: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to create the feeling that it is colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly 'rainy' or 'dry' seasons: the amount of rainfall remains almost the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are accustomed to human presence, their wildlife is still wild, so we should not feed or disturb them.
According to park authorities, keep at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from all other wildlife!
As calm as bison may seem, Canada deer, elk, bears, and almost every other large animal can still strike.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep proper distances, and these animals are big, wild, and can be dangerous, so give them some space.
Also, bear in mind that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking foods with strong smells and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of nearly 40,000.
Apia was founded in 1850, and since 1959 it has been the official capital of Samoa.
The harbor had been the site of a famous naval showdown in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave.
All ships were sunk except for one British cruiser, and about 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Maoist movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the assassination of the Tupua supreme leader, Tamashese Lyalophy III.
There are many beaches, as Auckland has two harbours, the most popular being in this area.
The North Shore (in the borough of North Harbour) beaches are washed by the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the North to Devonport in the South.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches suitable for safe swimming, and most of them are shaded by pohu-tokawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are in the Waitemata Harbour of the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These beaches are sometimes full of families with a good variety of shops along the coast.
The main local beer is called Number One and is not a complex beer, but is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called Manta.
A wide variety of French wines are available for tasting, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be a better choice.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're afraid, you can easily find bottled water.
In Australia the idea of flat white coffee is foreign, short black is espresso, cappuccino is topped with cream instead of foam, and tea is drunk without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive, but amazing.
Throughout the year, many trips are made to the reef and injuries due to any of these causes are rare on the reef.
Nevertheless, you take advice from the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Since 1770, the jellyfish have been appearing near beaches and river mouths from October to April, occasionally spotted at different times of the year.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people, and most sharks are afraid of them and would swim away from them.
Sea crocodiles do not live in the sea, their main natural habitat being the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking early ensures that travelers will have a place to stay when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often make arrangements with specific hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodation, such as camping, through an agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfer arrangements, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
Your application may be put on hold if you need time to reconsider the offer or to obtain other documents for your trip (e.g. visas).
However, any amendments or requests should be forwarded first to the travel agent and not sent directly to the hotel.
As for some festivals, most of the people who go to music festivals decide to camp there, and most of them consider it a very important part of the experience.
If you wish to be close to the action, you should start early to find a campsite close to the music.
Remember that while the music may end in the main scenes, there may be parts of the festival where the music continues late into the night.
Some festivals provide special camping facilities for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the position of your cabin, as when the boat goes through ice it makes terrible noises for those most affected.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time you will be staying in the city.
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by visitors, with no windows or clocks, and exits are hard to find.
Often special offers of food, drink, and entertainment are made to keep customers in good spirits and on the premises.
Free alcoholic beverages are offered at various places, but intoxication affects judgment, and a good gambler knows the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who is going to drive at high altitude or through mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, and very low temperatures.
On icy and snow-covered roads, there is not enough friction and it is difficult to drive on the bare asphalt.
During a blizzard, it can snow so much that it can trap you in a very short time.
Visibility may also be reduced by snow, moisture or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, where traffic runs for the most part without interruption all year round.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attractions in Africa and a sight for many visitors.
The term safari is widely used as the overland journey for the purpose of visiting the amazing African wildlife, especially the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get very close to cars, and basic equipment will help with visibility.
Lions, leopards and leopards are sometimes shy and are best seen with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a bush walk or hiking safari) consists of hiking either a few hours or a few days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events taking place at other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the Summer Olympics twice, having hosted them in 1964.
If you've arranged how you're going to fly and where you're going to stay for 2020 before the announcement that they're being postponed, you may be facing a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most coronavirus cancellation policies are not extended to July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
Most tickets for the events are expected to cost between 2,500 yen and 130,000 yen, while the price of standard tickets is around 7,000 yen.
Ironing can help dry wet clothes. Many hotels have irons and irons for borrowing, even if they are not in the room.
If an iron is not available, or if you are not interested in wearing ironed socks, you may use a sash if available.
Be careful not to allow the cloth to overheat (which may cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are various ways of purifying water, and some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas a minute of boiling water is sufficient, but in others several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have a concern, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter infectious animals that they are not used to encountering in parts of their country.
Parasites spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, carry poisons, and spread infections.
Communicable diseases or wild animals that have the ability to brutalize or kill humans are not often classified as harmful organisms.
Duty-free markets provide you with the opportunity to buy goods in specific locations without being charged with customs duties or excise duties.
Travelers to high-tax countries can save quite a bit of money sometimes, especially on products such as spirits and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont is very dangerous to drive on the Buffalo-Pittsburg highway, because it crosses many lonely rural parts.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your eyes open: roads with long gradients, narrow lanes and steep turns are the norm.
The posted speed limits are markedly lower than on previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and it is even more important to adhere strictly to them.
Yet, strangely enough, the cell phone signal is much stronger here than along other sections of the trail, such as the Pennsylvania Wilderness.
Germany's sweets are of a high quality, while Bavaria's is as plentiful and varied as its southern neighbour Austria.
Fruit desserts usually include apples, with which desserts are made all year round, and cherries and plums, which appear in the summer.
A large number of German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other dried fruits.
If you want a tasty little bread, try the so-called Berliner, Fankuchen or Krapf.
Curry consists of spices and herbs, and is accompanied by foods of animal or plant origin.
Curry can be found in either the dry or the wet state depending on the amount of liquid it contains.
In the inland parts of northern India and Pakistan, curry is mainly used for yogurt; in the southern and other coastal parts of India, it is mainly used for coconut juice.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an inclusive term that includes a wide variety of cuisines from regions across the country.
But, when used without other designations, the term tends to denote food from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Now found everywhere in the archipelago, Javanese local cuisine offers a menu of lightly spiced dishes, with Javanese-preferred basic flavorings such as peanuts, chilli, sugar (specifically Javanese coconut sugar) and many aromatic spices.
The suspension is used as support for the lower limbs of the rider and is held by the right and left sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider, however they can present safety challenges due to the possibility of their feet sticking to them.
If a rider falls off the horse but his foot gets caught in the reins, the horse can drag him down the road as he runs.
First, most riders have special shoes that have heels, a soft sole, and a relatively small bottom.
Then, some of the saddles, especially the English ones, have safety bars that allow a leather saddle to fall off the saddle if pulled back from the rider at the time of the fall.
Cochamo Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America with a variety of large walls and granite cliffs.

Snow climbing sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve skating on downhill terrain that is covered by snow with skis or snowboards placed on your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, often called ski bums, planning entire ski vacations at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old, cave paintings depicting skiers dating back to 5,000 B.C.!
Skiing as a sport dates back to the 17th century, and in 1861, the first recreational ski club was founded in Australia by Norwegians.
Ski backpacking: This activity is also called off-piste skiing, snowboarding or mountain skiing.
It is related to alpine skiing and mountaineering, but usually does not include them, as the latter are done on steep terrain and require much harder skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a similar distance covered by hiking.
In ideal conditions you will be able to cover relatively longer distances than by walking - but very rarely will you develop the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on the specially shaped tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, visiting many countries during the journey would require visa applications and multiple passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, could be said to function as a single country in this respect.
While staying in this zone you are generally allowed to cross the border without passing through passport control points again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa in each of the Schengen Member States, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what qualifies as an antique, and some tax authorities define antiques as goods over 100 years old.

Handmade goods can be defined as antiques, even though they are more recent than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer farming is an important occupation for the Sami while the culture surrounding trade is also important for many engaged in other professions.
Even by tradition, of course, not all Sami were involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but some made a living from fishing, hunting and more, using reindeer primarily as a source of sustenance.
Today many Sami work in modern trade, and tourism is an important source of income in the Sami region of Sámi.

A course will normally cover all the topics discussed here in much more detail, usually because of the practical training.
A class will usually last 2-5 days and will include role-play, lots of first aid training and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the desert are common, but publications dealing with the war zone are few and far between.
Those traveling and planning gender reassignment surgery in another country should make sure they have valid documents for the return journey.
The intention of governments to issue passports without gender (X) or updated documents to correspond to the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents also changes considerably.
Security checkpoint investigations have also become much more intrusive in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender people in pre-operative condition cannot expect to pass through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Surface currents are the returning currents of waves that crash on the shore, often on a reef or something like that.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flows are concentrated in some deeper sections where strong currents may be generated at great depth.
Most deaths are caused by exhaustion from trying to swim against the current, which is not always possible.
With you off the current, swimming to land won't be any more difficult than it should be.
You're trying to aim at a point where you've never been trapped before or, based on your skills and whether you've been located, it might be better to wait for rescue.
The shock of returning starts before the culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shortening), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have adapted easily to a new culture sometimes have difficulty adjusting back to their native culture.
When you return to your country after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and have lost some of your habits that were not part of the culture of your country.

In remote areas where there is no telephone service, a satellite phone may be your only option.
Satellite phone does not replace mobile phone in general, because you have to be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
The service is often used in shipping, including pleasure craft, as well as for missions that use remote data and have voice communication needs.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information on how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
It is particularly appealing to people who have finished school, as it allows them to take a year off before starting university without jeopardizing their education.
In several cases, enrolling in a gap-year course abroad can increase your chances of progressing to higher education in your own country.
Usually, tuition fees are required to enroll in such educational programs.
Finland is a great place for boating, and in the 'land of a thousand lakes' you will find thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelago.
The boat won't necessarily be of use to you in the archipelago and the lakes.
While the archipelago and larger lakes are indeed big enough for any pleasure craft, smaller boats or even kayaks provide an alternative experience.
Boating is a national hobby for Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand but is generally very unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the rate is one in forty).
Almost all private cruises in the Baltic include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic town for a few full days while returning to sleep on the boat at night.
If you disembark in the city only through excursions organized by the boat, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruise lines include Berlin, Germany, in their brochures. As shown in the map above, Berlin is not near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a very frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown or have had a traumatic experience.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fears and resentments of many people for other things.

Courier companies are well paid for the speedy delivery of goods, and time is often a factor when it comes to business papers, merchandise or spare parts for an urgent repair.
The larger companies have their own planes for some routes, but there are problems for other routes and smaller companies.
If they sent things by air freight, on some flights it might take days to unload and clear customs.
The only way to get it through faster would be to send it as checked baggage, but airline regulations don't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where your role begins.
The obvious way to fly to the first or business position is to pay a bunch of money for the privileged position (or even better, ask your company to do it for you).
However, this comes at a cost: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class and eleven times for first class!
In general, there is no reason to even look for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airline companies are well aware that there is a core class of passengers who are willing to spend a lot of money for the privilege of a quick and comfortable transfer to their destination, and they charge accordingly.
Chisinau is the capital of Moldova, the local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
