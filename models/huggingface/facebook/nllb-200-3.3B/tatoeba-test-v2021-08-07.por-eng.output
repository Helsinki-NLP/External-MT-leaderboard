White: rook on a1, pawn on b6, king on c8. Black: pawns on a7 and b7, king on a8, bishop on b8. White puts the opponent in zugzwang by playing the rook on a6, after which Black will have only two options: take the rook on a6 or play his bishop to any other house of the diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, White advances his pawn from b6 to b7 and then mates. In the second situation, White takes the pawn from black a7, with identical result.
