This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that's already widespread, but it also gives details that fossils can't usually give, like color and three-dimensional appearance.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were bone-brown on top and pale or carotenoid on the underside.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed handle, called the main shaft, but have other features of feathers - soft fibers and soft hairs - researchers concluded that the main shaft likely represented a later evolutionary development of these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but for thermoregulation or for falconry. The researchers noted that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers, not those of a chicken.

The work achieved is mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observation of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team expects should be caused by the tidal forces and the rift between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon affects the earth, causing tides and waves, so the Milky Way affects the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists could conclude that dark matter influences other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around the galaxy is surrounded by a kind of halo, and is made up of many small particles.

Their thermal behavior is not constant as in the large caves on Earth, which often maintain fairly constant temperatures, but is consistent with the fact that these are deep holes in the ground", said Glenn Cushing of a team of astrogeologists at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the University of North Carolina located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a screen, putting a pre-printed sheet of paper with their chosen candidate in an envelope.
Once the authorities have verified the identity of the voter, he puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the ballot.

Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent, so that voters and observers can witness that there are no envelopes in them at the beginning of voting and that no envelopes will be added other than those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to testify at any stage of the process.

Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee points out that "it really seems like journalists are going down a thin line if they publish photos etc of suspects".
The prosecutor's office, which has full jurisdiction over the prosecution, told reporters that no further comment would be made at least until the indictment.
According to the source, the document refers to the border dispute in which Palestine wants the borders to return to the pre-1967 Middle East war.
Other topics, reportedly, include the future state of Jerusalem, a holy place for both nations, and the dispute over the Jordan Valley.
Israel seeks a permanent military presence in the valley for 10 years after the agreement is signed while the Palestinian Authority agrees to leave that presence for only five years.
The shooters in the additional pest control trial were to be under strict supervision by the rangers, as the sample was observed and its effectiveness evaluated.
According to the Sport Hunters Association's hunting program, in collaboration with NPWS and the Sport Hunters Association of Australia (SHA), qualified volunteers are enrolled.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of Parks and Heritage Conservation at NPWS, the four selected shooters for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety instructions and training.
Martelli was sworn in yesterday for a new nine-member Interim Election Commission (CEC).
This is Martelli's fifth interim election commission in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission proposed that the SRK resign early as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
With the Martelli Commission, he actually responded to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Sometimes violent protests have been triggered by the failure to hold elections, some dating as far back as 2011.
About 60 cases of faulty iPod devices overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires, and four people suffered minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METTI announced that they had received a notification from Apple of 34 more cases of overheating, which the company considers "not serious".
In its response, the Ministry called the delay in Apple's report a "regrettable truth".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 am (09:19 pm GMT Friday).
Representatives of the Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said no damage was reported in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and adults, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers replaced the scene with an elderly woman who needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
She trained as a midwife and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to research preterm birth in his spare time.
His research showed that the hormone would accelerate the maturation of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two flight recorder black boxes in the middle.
Luna was also honored by fellow fighters.
Tommy Dreamer said Luna was the first Queen of Extreme, my first manager, Luna died last night at two months old, pretty unique just like her, a strong woman.
Dustin Goldast Runnels commented that Luna was as distant as I was... maybe more... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she's in a better place.
Of the 1,400 people polled ahead of the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic rose by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard during the 2010 federal election campaign argued that she believed Australia should become a republic after the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share this view, wishing Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
According to the extremes noted in the poll, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three Commonwealth Games relay, but his complaints have raised doubts about his fitness.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to overcome the pain because it's banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software by early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It's possible that comets were a source of water blasting down to Earth, along with organic matter that could create proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, specifically how the earth formed, because comets collided with the earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill to allow same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political talk and nonsense".
There's speculation that he's running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims allows aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to the old technology that relies on ground-based radar to help flight controllers more accurately locate the aircraft and give pilots more accurate information.
No additional transport is organised, and subways will not stop at Wembley and parking spaces and public transport crossing places are not available at the stadium.
Fears of lack of transportation increased the possibility of the match being held behind closed doors without the team's fans.
Research published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved in just two generations, although this process was believed to have taken much longer, due to the breeding between the endemic Galapagos chink, Geospiza fortis, and the large cactus chink, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into any shape, it can be curled into small shapes.
It can be pulled into a thin wire, which can be twisted and twisted, hammered or dragged in layers.
It can be made very thin and bonded to another metal, and it can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn images in books called "Illuminated Manuscripts".
This is called a chemical pH value, and you can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or moisture (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (as hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders and then, with clean, wet hands, squeeze them into a ball.
The moisture in your hands will react with the outer layers, which you will feel unusual and form a kind of envelope.
The cities of Harapa and Mohenjo-daro had running water toilets in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in Minoan-era towns on Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, in some situations toilets were part of public baths where both men and women went together.
When you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives a call and then rejects it back almost at the same moment.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket, over 100 feet high, to carry a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the best thing it's done for us is it's made transportation easier and faster.
He provided the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are several medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-roaming feline pets) that eat the many small prey species, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a domain, a special job that every cat has that prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called herds.
The herd is made up of one to three blood-related males, along with a maximum of thirty females and young.
The females are usually closely related to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
The lion pack acts similarly to a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in behavior, as well as a lot of lethal odors to their prey.
Like a sister athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the force of the strongest man.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars.
The roar of the tiger is not like the full-throated roar of the lion, but more like a phrase of words that resemble a roar and a loud roar.
Ocelots like to eat small animals, and if they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds.
Scientists think that survivors follow and find prey by smell, sniffing the soil where they were.
They see well in the dark with night vision and move stealthily, too.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from the main population from which it originated (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or river or if it moves to a new island where it cannot easily return), it often finds itself in an environment different from that in which it was previously.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different traits or adaptations to be a strong competitor, compared to what it needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, the new population begins to adapt to its new environment and begins to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans emit (or exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis.
Our habitats are made from plants, our clothes are made from plants, and plants make up most of the food we eat.
Mosasaurus was the top predator of his time, so he was afraid of nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were lined with more than 70 sharp teeth, along with another row at the top of its mouth, meaning that it had no escape from anything in its path.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible he had a chattering tongue, ate turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and maybe even was a cannibal.
It attacked anything that could get into the water; even a giant dinosaur like Tyrannosaurus rex was not grown.
Although most of the food is familiar to us, the Romans also had their own strange or unusual feasts, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called a pollo.
Another difference was that while poor men and women ate their meals in chairs, rich men preferred to have communal banquets, where they could rest while eating.
The cuisine of ancient Rome certainly did not include products brought to Europe from the Americas or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted mustard.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their primary gods, which they considered to be the home of that god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to serve the needs of the gods through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary that was only for the priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped elevations, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The top of the elevation was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
Most of the life of an ancient Jewish family took place in the open air.
Women cooked in the yard; shops were just open-air weights facing the street.
The land of Canaan was not heavily forested, so timber was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and in Old Norse lore, Eric the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each country was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure", you might believe that on the back of the Declaration of Independence is a map of hidden treasure.
Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence is inscribed with the words "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The text is inverted and is at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was originally wrapped for storage.
So it's possible the note was simply written as a sign.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still not liberated.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies entered southern France, and the invasion was called Operation Dragon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were heading for Germany.
A civilization is a distinct culture formed by a significantly large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and it also somehow defines the size of society.
Civilized culture presages the transfer of knowledge over several generations, a long-lasting cultural imprint and a fairly large expansion.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - where the only component was Congress - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, with no national executive or judicial branch, it relied on the often uncooperative state authorities to enforce all its laws.
Nor did he have the authority to overturn the laws of taxes and customs between states.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and states perceived the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion.
The most popular sports include: football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the group of islands that Japan has, it is often geographically referred to as the  archipelago
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by wrote the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning a change in local grain-processing habits and employing Chinese arghts to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took over the coastal areas of western and northern Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main buildings, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the edges of the complex have been restored to give tourists a glimpse of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, a thirty percent restoration of Machu Picchu had been carried out and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was the size of film that prevailed at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly its proportions are inherited from the sensory formats of the digital camera image.
The 35mm format is actually quite confusing, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore considered to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., the APS format group) are equal or significantly close to proportional.
The most abused and most often ridiculed right of third is a simple rule that creates dynamics while maintaining order in the picture.
It states that it is most effective to place the main subject at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Roman Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, was under attack.
Despite differences in language and customs, Christianity united European nations for over a thousand years.
Its all-encompassing power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds should be used for that purpose only.
The central authority of the church has been located in Rome for over a thousand years, and such a concentration of power and money has caused many to question whether the principles have been met.
Soon after the breaking of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off essential supplies to the military and civilians, although the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire parts of the ocean, thus endangering even neutral shipping.
With few options to respond to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920's, pacifism and isolationism prevailed among most citizens and nations.
After the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to begin work at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a collection of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Bachelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each stage of China or each ruling family was a separate dynasty.
The most famous of these phases was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years between the Han and the Jin dynasties.
During this period, there were fierce battles between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, when thousands of people died fighting to sit on the highest seat in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are numerous social and political influences, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the land belongs to all people, not just to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, jobs were opened up to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same was true of the military because instead of ranking in the army based on class, it was now based on caliber.
The French Revolution inspired many other oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things outside of this earthly life. He often went to a cave that became known as Hira on Mount Nur (Light) to meditate.
He locked himself in a cave, which has survived the ages, giving a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
Perched atop a mountain north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find even if someone knew it was fasting.
Nothing is visible except the clear, beautiful sky and the many mountains around it.
Of the seven wonders, only the Great Pyramid of Giza remains today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of a number of large pyramidal structures built in honor of the late pharaoh.
The Giza Plain or Giza Necropolis in Egypt's Valley of Death contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of the pharaoh Khufu, and most of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The upper arrow symbol looks like the letter V, and the lower arrow symbol looks like a joint or square that lacks its bottom side.
Up means you should start at the top and push the hammer, and down means you should start at the frog (where your hand holds the hammer) and pull the hammer.
Moving the hummer upward gives a softer sound, while moving it downward gives a louder and more aggressive sound.
Feel free to write your own notes, but remember, the printed notes are there for a musical purpose, so they should usually be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11 year old Marie-Thérèse and 4 year old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forcibly returned to Paris, from Versailles, on 6 October 1789, by a group of market women.
They rode back to Paris, surrounded by crowds screaming and threatening the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the windows of the carriage.
At one point, a man in the crowd waved the head of the royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The military costs of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of the costs, and the interest on the bonds fluctuated on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the super profit gained from the long-term exploitation of the Filipinos was a major asset of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that prompted the creation of the order.
The time when the events occurred, usually called the High Middle Ages, was the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from a technological impetus or technological imperative to a strong sense that human destiny is guided by a fundamental logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology, in itself, follows a path that largely transcends cultural or political influence, and that technology, on the other hand, has influences on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, someone might say that the motor vehicle necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a state-level road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new methods are being worked on in manufacturing to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass car ownership also leads to increased rates of road accidents, leading to the invention of new techniques in health care to sanitize injured bodies.
Romanticism contained a significant element of cultural determinism, taken up by writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography created individuals, and over time, customs and culture associated with geography emerged, so in harmony with the place of society, they were superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began about 400 C.E. and lasted until about 1100 C.E.
Its status deteriorated during the twelfth century mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts, such as silk and spices, that were valued more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
During this period the title of the Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style peaked between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, because of slow communication channels, Western fashion was often 25 to 30 years behind.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments of that time, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Existential agriculture is agriculture that is carried out to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Existential agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses preserved seed originating from the ecoregion in combination with fruit production or other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
In the past, most farmers farmed for their own needs, as is still the case in many developing lands.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by social norms, and enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ as a result of the age, ethnic group, class, location and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that define a subculture as distinctive may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often mark their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style that encompasses fashion, manners, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to turn to the several unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, poverty or deliberate abuse by adults, were left unsocialized while growing up.
Some feral children were confined by humans (usually their parents); in some cases this abandonment of the child was a result of the parents' denial of the child's serious mental or physical disability.
Rough children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or run away.
Others are said to have evolved from animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When fully grown from animals, the feral child shows behaviors (in physical limits) almost identical to those of the animal that cared for it, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, a technique called Scale Building goes a step further.
The technique called Scale Building is not a learning method but an auxiliary tool that provides support for individuals going through a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The ladder can be virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a kind of ladder, but so is the man with the connector in Microsoft Office.
The virtual scaffolding is built into the software and is designed to interrogate, encourage and explain procedures that might have been too difficult for the student to master on their own.
Children are placed in orphanages or foster homes for reasons ranging from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, yet growing.
We believe the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our care system should provide safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education and a secure health care system.
Care should provide for all the needs that were missing in the home from which they were previously taken.
The Internet contains elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of uses and access to pleasure.
For example, learning and socialization have been proposed as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Both Amy and McCord (1998) identify personal participation and "permanent relationships" as new motivational aspects, exploring audience reactions to websites.
Using video has led to significant breakthroughs in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last for milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that it could be detected if someone is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his book The President's Speech, stated how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are still able to accurately judge sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be common to animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection allows for the removal of expressed variations from the group.
Segregation and recombination move variation back and forth between the two groups in each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to meet its needs for amino acids from available plant sources.
Further, if it fails, there will be serious consequences: stunting, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant resources would be the proteins available in leaves and buds, but for primates like us, they're hard to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digested but also provides a high amount of protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
Given all the circumstances, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their protein problem almost the same way that chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking during your normal sleep and falling asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm to alarm you without completely waking you up.
If you accidentally turn off the clock while you sleep, you might put it on the other side of the room, so that you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, which is known as a diuretic) before bedtime, so a person must get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely related to the amount of tension in his body and spirit.
The less pressure, the more positive the life force present.
The only thing standing in the way of our goal is our own pressure and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, which were expanded with the Mahayana path of love and a variety of techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
With kundalini yoga, kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is "divine yoga". Through visualization of several deities the energy channels are cleared, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is formed.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and be a real fight, with proxy armies, on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, to Cuba and a host of other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defensive force had already been defeated and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize alongside the Roman Bridge Defense.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 troops of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian front after the invasion of the eastern parts of Poland, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international bilateral and multilateral treaties.
Shipping is by far the most efficient way of transporting large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
The Navy's job has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to transport your people and goods, while at the same time, making it harder for the enemy to transport his people and goods.
One of the most important examples of this recently was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, when the Americans tried to move people and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly U-boats, tried to stop such traffic.
If the Allies were defeated, Germany would probably be able to conquer Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to preserve them so that they could easily access milk, fur, meat, and leather.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that grazed on hills or pastures, tending to goats that were often children or adolescents, similar to the more well-known shepherds.
Horse-drawn trams were made in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the carriages were mainly built of parallel wooden planks, they could pull horses for greater speed and to pull a greater load than was carried on the then poor roads.
Railroad tracks were used from the beginning to hold the rails in place, but it was gradually found that the rails would be more efficient if they had a piece of iron on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first train with all-iron wheels was launched.
The first known mode of transportation was walking; humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, were not so used to walking upright.
Bipedal adaptations have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although perhaps Sachelanthropus walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start acting more environmentally friendly, join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
In many cases, this is similar to symptomatic treatment, but if a temporary solution is not sought, then the root of the problem must be found and thus eradicated.
It is quite clear that the world has been greatly changed by mankind's scientific and technological progress, and the problems have been compounded by mankind's overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, the draft in manuscript, signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomas, was sent a few streets down, to John Dunlap's printing house.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were made, known today as Dunlap's Pages.
The document was first publicly read by John Nixon in the courtyard of the Independence Building on July 8.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, read to his troops in New York on July 9, and arrived in London on August 10.
The 25-ten-page documents that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Today, most paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still make them look like dinosaurs.
They have claws and claws, lay eggs and move on their two hind legs like T. rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on information management encoded with binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or if computer jargon is used, they are called bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are fairly common, so a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The best indicator of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open box of medicines or toxic household chemicals.
Look at the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
For this group of insects, entomologists use the term bug in a formal sense.
The term comes from the ancient resemblance to bedbugs, which are insects well adapted to parasitize humans.
Both bedbugs and parasites are herbivores, adapted to living in a nest or to living in a home.
There are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) throughout the United States, making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to have multiple sclerosis.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or that of their child.
These couples have the opportunity to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, the biological parents terminate their custody so that another couple can have custody of the child.
The main goal of science is to learn how the world works by means of the scientific method, which is the method used in most scientific research.
But, however, it is not only that, but experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions, as well as observation, also drive scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, with a particular emphasis on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all questions of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West remained cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often knowingly depend heavily on the presence of endogenous cycles and their creation through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just reactions to external periodic signals, are documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue with a period of free cycling even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading hypotheses that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to embed their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments that either tagged the DNA in the phase with radioactive phosphorus, or the protein in the phase with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the genetic material involved, and whether the affected cells are sex cells.
Only mutated genetic cells can be passed on to children, whereas mutated cells anywhere else can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including the flora and fauna.
Examples of activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
An example of this is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to work and are met by others whose destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic shared transportation, everyone is somehow connected and supports the private car-based transportation system.
Science now points out that this massive carbon-based economy has displaced the biosphere from its stable state that has sustained human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems.
In developed lands, complaints about water quality or collapsed bridges are rare.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints, why do they disappoint every day? Are transport engineers simply not competent? Or is something more serious going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers know to stick to a reasonably constant frame; thus, traffic flows are known to have a certain reasonable constancy and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better illustrate the flow of traffic, relationships are established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to escape from enemies and more efficiently find food and mates.
Many insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back alongside their bodies.
This provides them with a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot gather wings are the fairy horses and the unicorns.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed otherwise; that the solar system revolved around the earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
This seems reasonable, because you don't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times the volume of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, at six miles wide in places.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows from rivers around the world into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River's main course is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long.
Although stone pyramid construction continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza were never surpassed in their size and technical excellence of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were already more than a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the world's smallest independent state and the least populous.
Legislation and official Vatican communications are in Italian.
Italian is also spoken daily by people working in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because all of these can be found in nature in raw form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle thought that everything was composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements, earth, water, air, and fire.
It's something like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also thought that they change into new substances to create what we see.
Alloy is actually a mixture of two or more metals.
Metals include elements such as calcium and potassium, and of course, there are metals such as silver and gold.
There may also be alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them could fit into the dot at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil became a good friend to many when it appeared.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new writing methods, the pencil has declined in status and use.
People now text on a computer and never have to go near a sharp edge again.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new appears.
The physical bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to create a nucleus of many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, and then, as the core splits again, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with or without a little push.
The Moon's surface is composed of rocks and dust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It's thinner below the seas and thicker below the plains.
There may be more basalt plain on the near side because the crust is thinner, making it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on discovering what excites people or what they like.
According to these theories, humans have certain needs and/or desires that are adopted as they mature from children into adults.
These theories look at what makes some people like the things they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
The two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge when managers start managing their former coworkers. One is the attempt to remain one of the boys (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, performing performance reviews, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable for their actions.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person becomes an unrecognizable person who feels he or she has to change everything the team has done and make it his or her way.
However, the leader has ultimate responsibility for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often results in conflict between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams operate to the same standards of excellence as standard teams, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often function as a contact point for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members because their teams may meet depending on different time zones, which may not be understood by their local leadership.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also an exceptional component of a virtual team.
The management team is the "invisible team" to which each member corresponds.
Why would an organization want to go through the long process of creating a learning organization? One goal for putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in all functional departments of the organization, creativity and ingenuity flow.
As a result, the organisation's collaborative process of overcoming barriers can lead to a new innovative process of serving customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, along with shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to researching consciousness, so it narrows the scope of research and makes it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is the foundation of scientists' research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and explore previously unseen structures and processes in the brain.
This provides a wealth of information and material to create simulation models that will help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, AI is a very important branch of computer science, dealing with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research on artificial intelligence involves making machines automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to user diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice, and face recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
After being incorporated into several software applications for home computers and video games, the AI system is now commonly used in economics, medicine, engineering and the military.
Field trips are a big part of every classroom, and very often, a teacher would like to take her students to places where bus travel is not an option.
The technology offers a virtual tour solution, where students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in class.
And virtual sharing excursions are a good way to reminisce about the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students at Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, each year the website is rebuilt, but the old versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogs also help improve students' writing, and while students often start the blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience changes that.
Since students are the most critical audience, the blogger starts to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
The need to nurture the interest of the audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to expand learning to an area far beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs can encourage students to be more analytical and coverage-minded; by actively responding to materials on the Internet, students can define their positions in the context of the written texts of others, and also highlight their own views on specific issues (Oraвец, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, characterized by a series of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south are Niagara Falls, and to the north is home to the pristine natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more make Ontario the perfect Canadian that foreigners think it is.
The large areas to the north are sparsely populated, and some of them are almost uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadians.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is arguably the largest and most isolated continent in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the islands and it quickly spread to the Comoros and the Maya.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, after Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west, the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all women travelers state that they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
It helps her to wear a ring (not a ring that looks too expensive.
Women need to understand that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider bullying and that it is not uncommon to be followed, held by the hand, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and do not be afraid to stick to your position (cultural differences or not, that's not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids used it as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and built it under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badja, but it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases here.
Casablanca is one of the most uninteresting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as mourning pots, pottery, leather goods, hooks, and a whole range of cheap ornaments, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far eastern parts near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Niragongo volcano that flooded most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside Goma should be checked to find out the state of unrest that exists in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing to the Niragongo volcano, along with some of the cheapest mountain gorilla hunts in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma.
Along with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu came to be used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Although the city is a tourist attraction and has an airport, today Timbuktu is a poor city.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
He was a main character during the PBS special, The Wonder of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city is a stark contrast to the rest of the country, because it has more Arab charm than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of the Republic of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park stretches for 19,500 square kilometers [1,200 sq mi] and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each with a different fauna.
The same is one of the biggest attractions in South Africa and is considered the forerunner of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily maintenance fees and park admission fees.
It may also be useful to purchase a "Wild Card" with which one can enter any park in South Africa or all national parks in South Africa.
The name of the territory of Hong Kong comes from Hong Kong Island and it is the place that is the main focus of many tourists.
The layout of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline is compared to a glittering graph that stands out in the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head opposite the coast of Kowloon.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the dry land along the northern coast.
It's the place that the British colonizers occupied, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, that's a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the longest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast, into the Bangladeshi and Indian interior.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forest area of Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But forests are not just swamps of rhizomes - they encompass some of the last remaining strongholds of the great jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered by water/marshes.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that 400 royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 deer now live in the area.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those traveling east and Jakarta/Bumtang leave between 06:30 and 07:30 hours.
Since inter-city buses are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
In most areas, small Japanese minibuses are used, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and efficient way to travel to nearby destinations, such as Paro (150 nhl) and Punaka (200 nhl).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Oiapoque River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oiapoque in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long and have two lanes each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical span under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft).[citation needed] Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The plan is for the bridge to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs posts are expected to be completed.
The Guaraná were the most important indigenous group that lived in present-day eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also engaged in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaicuru and the Payagua, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called the "Great Province of Southeast Asia", was born as a result of the encounter of the Spanish conquistadors with the indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted more than three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is in December at the polo grounds in Las Canitas.
You can also see smaller tournaments and competitions at other times of the year.
For news on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check out Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands pound (FKP), which is equal in value to one British pound (GBP).
The money is exchanged at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley, just across the street from the FIC West store.
British Pounds are mainly accepted throughout the islands and in conjunction with Stanley credit cards, and US Dollars are also commonly accepted.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted in remote islands, although you may be able to pay in British and U.S. currency; check with the owners in advance to determine which payment method is acceptable to you.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before you leave the islands.
Montevideo is south of the equator, so it's summer there when it's winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo has a subtropical climate; temperatures above +30 degrees Celsius are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combined make it colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no specific "rain" or "dry" periods: the amount of rainfall remains relatively the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, they are still wild animals and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park guidelines, keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from any other wildlife!
No matter how tame they may seem, bison, moose, bears, and almost any large animal could attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get hurt because they don't keep their distance.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking food with strong odors and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s, and since 1959 has been officially the capital of Samoa.
In 1889, the port experienced a notorious sea stalemate when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one British warship was sunk, with the loss of nearly 200 American and German lives.
In the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city ended with the assassination of the Toupua supreme leader Tamasese Lyalolofi III.
There are many beaches, because Auckland has two harbours.
The beaches on the north shore (in North Harbor County) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Davenport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches that are safe for swimming, and most have shade from the hutoqua trees.
Tamaki Drive Beaches is on the Waitematā Harbour, in the affluent suburbs of Messines Bay and St Helier in central Auckland.
These are family beaches that can get crowded at times, with a good selection of shops along the coast.
The most famous local beer is called Nambur Wan, which is not heavy, but a pleasant and refreshing beer.
There's a lot of French wine to take, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be better travel.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water can be easily found if you are shy.
The idea of regular white coffee is not unique to Australians; the short black coffee is espresso, the cappuccino is high in cream (not foam), and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is made to Belgian standards, and although expensive, the fruit juices are excellent.
Trips to the reef are common throughout the year and it is rare to have a reef injury from these causes.
However, listen to the advice of the authorities, observe all signs, and heed safety warnings.
The cube jellyfish occurs along beaches and estuaries, from October to April, north of 1770.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans anyway.
Sea crocodiles do not live constantly in the ocean, their original habitat being in the estuaries, north of Rockhampton.
By making advance reservations, a traveler can be assured that he will have a place to sleep as soon as he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents usually have agreements with certain hotels, although you can also book accommodation elsewhere, such as a campsite, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They may also hold your reservation if you need some time to think about the offer or to provide other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Any changes or additions or requests should be checked first with the travel agent, not directly with the hotel.
At some festivals, the majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on site, and most attendees consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be as close to the event center as possible, you'll have to get in early and get a campsite near the music.
Remember that although the music on the main stages has ended, there are parts of the festival where it plays late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are crossing the North Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin location because crossing the ice creates a terrible noise for those most at risk.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include transit through the city. Passengers on the cruise are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests.
They usually have special food, drink and entertainment deals to keep guests in the mood and stay here.
However, drinking distorts judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who is going to drive at high altitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or very cold temperatures.
On roads with ice and snow, the friction is small and cannot be driven as on asphalt.
During snowstorms, it can quickly snow enough to trap you.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or snowfall or by condensation or freezing of vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal conditions in many lands, and traffic is almost uninterrupted year-round.
The safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most popular for many visitors.
The popular sense of the term safari refers to a land trip to observe the beautiful African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles closer, so even standard equipment allows for good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and are best seen with the double eye.
"Walking safaris (also called "wildlife walks", "mountain safari" or "walking") consist of walking, either for several hours or several days".
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the 1964 games.
If you booked a flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in an awkward situation.
There are differences in cancellation policies but as of late March, most cancellation policies caused by the coronavirus do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry out. Many hotels have a washing iron and ironing board that are available for borrowing even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have a hairbrush, or if you don't like wearing hairbrushed socks, then you can try a hair dryer, if you have one.
Be careful that the material does not become too hot (which in turn can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, burning).
Although there are many different methods of water purification, some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is sufficient, while in others it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in efficiency, which is something to be concerned about, and you should consider buying sealed bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that are absent in the regions from which they come.
Parasites can spoil food, cause inflammation, or in more serious cases, allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a person by force, are not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to buy goods exempt from paying taxes and excise duties at certain locations.
Travelers who travel to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The drive from Point Marion to Fairmont has the most exciting conditions for driving on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh freeway, passing through isolated forested areas.
If you are not used to driving on a country road, be aware: high hills, narrow roads, and steep curves dominate.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than the previous and subsequent sections, usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), so strict adherence to them is even more important than usual.
Yet, surprisingly, the cell signal is much stronger here than in other areas, such as the Penn Divines.
German biscuits are very good, and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit and apple cakes are common throughout the year, and cherries and plums are available in the summer.
Many German cakes contain almonds, nuts, and other spicy fruits. Popular cakes go well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you like small but rich sweets, try these, which are called berliner, fankouhen, or krapfene depending on the area.
Karito is a herbal and spicy food that contains meat or vegetables.
The carrot can be either dry or warm, depending on the amount of liquid.
In the continental regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used to prepare curry dishes; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
The word Indonesian food is a general term that encompasses a variety of regional cuisines found throughout the nation's 17,000 islands.
But when used without additional attributes, the term usually means food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine features a selection of simply spicy dishes, the most dominant flavors of Javanese cuisine being peanuts, chillies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The saddle's legs are supported by the rider's feet, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability for the rider, but there may also be safety concerns because of the likelihood of the rider's feet getting caught in them.
If a horse throws the rider but his foot gets caught in the saddle, if the horse runs away, he may pull the rider.
First, most riders wear high-heeled boots and a slim, very tight, skirt.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety handles that allow the harness belt to fall off the saddle if the rider pulls on it in a fall.
Kohami Valley - Chile's main mountaineering destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and crevices.
The peaks offer breathtaking views, and climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes through the limitless potential of the mountain's sides.
Winter alpine sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports in which you ski or snowboard on snow.
Skiing is a major travel activity for many enthusiasts, often known as "ski vagabonds", whose entire vacation revolves around skiing in a certain location.
The idea of skiing is very old - there are cave paintings of skiers as early as 5,000 B.C.E.!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, with the first recreational ski club opened by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Skiing: This activity is also called cross-country skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is related to, but does not always include, alpine skiing or mountaineering, which are performed on steep terrain and require much redder skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you could cover longer distances than by walking - but you would rarely reach skiing speeds without a heavy backpack and paved trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent states, and under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean having to submit multiple visa applications and passport controls.
The Schengen area, however, acts somewhat like a state in this respect.
As long as you're in this zone, you can generally cross borders without constantly going through passport controls.
Similarly, by holding a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa in each Schengen country separately, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique, and some tax agencies define antiques as objects that are more than 100 years old.
The definition varies by geographic location with the age limit being shorter in North America than in Europe.
Craft can be defined as antiques, although they are more recent than similar mass-produced goods.
Irvashi farming is the most important means of existence for the Lapps, and the culture associated with trade is also important for many other professions.
But even traditionally, not all Lapps were involved in large-scale reindeer farming, but lived off fishing, hunting and the like, while deer were usually used as working animals.
Today many Sami work in modern occupations. Tourism is a significant source of income in Sapmi, in the Sami region.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma, the word Gypsy is usually considered offensive because it associates negative stereotypes and misperceptions of the Roma people.
If travel warnings are issued for the country you want to visit, you may have consequences for travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance.
You may want to get advice from other governments, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The recommendations are just a brief overview of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, general, and overly simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Rough weather is a generic name for any bad weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social unrest and loss of human life.
