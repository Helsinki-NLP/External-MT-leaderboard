According to British media, US Navy Operations Deputy Secretary Colonel William Moran said that while the U.S. Navy is rebuilding its strength to respond to Russia’s increasingly worrying on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, the U.S. continues to put the Asia-Pacific area – the Pentagon expands its scope to the Indian Ocean – Asia-Pacific – as the headquarters of the Navy.
According to the British Journal of Defence on 24 September, the U.S. listed China Russia as a strategic competitor in the new defence strategy announced earlier this year.
Since then, the U.S. Navy has restored the second fleet in order to more directly confront the activity of Russia.
These actions raise some question and concern among allies and analysts who are concerned that the U.S. Navy may be far from the Obama administration’s “Asia-Pacific re-balance” strategy.
But Colonel Moran said the focus of the U.S. Navy remains in the West Pacific.
On January 24, 2018, at a round table meeting hosted by the U.S. National Asian Research Bureau in Washington, he said, “There was no significant change for us.”
Moran says, “The focus remains on re-balancing, focus transfer or no matter how you want to describe it.”
He acknowledges that the United States has a close relationship with Europe.
He said, “We will continue to focus on the growth of the West Coast and balance what we can do.”
While Moran pointed out that the general policy on Russia belongs to the scope of the U.S. Defense Minister, he warned: “Russia may face demographic and economic challenges, but history has shown that if we conflict with them, they will be very hard.”
Colonel Moran said, as part of the U.S. re-establishment campaign against Russia, China and other competitors, the U.S. Navy is dynamically deploying its forces into a "new operational model" which will help the opponent to stop the U.S. aircraft fleet battle groups or other assets to be deployed at any specific time and place.
“Our Navy and Navy support it—the concept of unpredictable fighting, not to appear again and again at the same place, almost like a line—this is our practice.”
The first attempt to take this new approach was the “Harry Truman” aircraft carrier battle group, the early deployment of which included work visits to the port and patrolling in areas that are usually only passed through.
Moran said the U.S. Navy is currently trying to ensure its allies know that these ships will continue to patroll in the traditional region and are still addressing logistics and family-related issues for the new implementation process.
The Australian Royal Navy Commander Michael Nunan will also speak in the event, saying the Australian army can cooperate with the U.S. aircraft carriers.
He said the situation will continue as the Royal Australian Navy plans to purchase nine more guard ships equipped with the Zeus Shield operating system.

On Friday, Japan’s ITU trading agency identified a $1.3 billion decrease in value loss in China’s CFD investments, reducing its largest enterprise investment transaction due to the impact of China and the U.S. trade tensions.
In May 2016, in Tokyo, Japan, a man passed the headquarters of the Toulouse Corporation.
Through the trade war, the U.S. grain sector, Gohong, has suspended financial transactions in the field of agriculture.
Previously, some Japanese heavy equipment manufacturers, telecommunications companies, and others, when announcing the latest results, have issued warnings about the impact of China-American trade friction, and now these Japanese trade agencies have also joined this line.
The U.S. and China impose tariffs on each other for hundreds of billion dollars of goods, and U.S. President Trump threatens, if the dispute cannot be solved, to expand the scope of taxation to a total of over $50 billion of Chinese transit goods.
Tsuyoshi Hachimura, Minister of Commerce and Finance, said the trade dispute could have a greater impact on China’s economy next year.
In 2015, it has invested $10 billion in ITU and Thai Bee Group, obtaining 20% of its shares.
Hachimura said it was a loss of 1.43.3 billion yuan ($1.3 billion) to this part of the shareholders, due to the assumption that the share price will not rise back in the near future.
Itto Trustins the profit forecast for the financial year ended on March 31, 2019 at 50 billion yuan.
In July, China imposed 25% tariffs on US soya imports to counter Washington’s trade friction.
“Our grain business has been hit by the U.S. and China trade friction,” said Mr. Vichy Yonghua, Chief Financial Officer.
He said Gong has stopped financial transactions on his own accounts since September.
Gohong spokesman Pat Burke said in a statement on Friday that the company’s move was “in line with internal policy limits and due to the lack of market opportunities.”
He also said the suspension of financial transactions will not lead to a decrease in employment.

On November 5th, the U.S. media announced that the votes for the middle-term elections had entered the time of recounting.
On 4 November, President Trump and Democratic opponents actively "called" to their core voters.
Both major parties pointed out that the voting rate will be the key to the right-wing election.
It is that 48 hours before the U.S. people voted, Trump was busy attending the Republican candidate's demonstrations, while former President Obama went to Indiana to call for the election candidate for the Democratic Federal Senate, Joe Donnelly, and shouted to the crowd the final appeal before the election.
On November 4, Trump arrived in Meghan, Georgia for the Republican Governor candidate, Brian Kemp Station, saying, “On Tuesday you have to go to the voting room and you have to vote.”
“The contrast of the election could not be clearer.”
The political enthusiasm of voters has risen to a rare peak, with early voting in some states far above usual.
The former U.S. president faces the first mid-term elections, and the seats of the parliamentary party he belongs to tend to decrease.
According to the Washington Post and the U.S. Broadcasting News Network (ABC News), the new poll revealed that although the Democratic Federal House election remains a major advantage, the Republicans can benefit from economic assessment and Trump’s strict attention to border security.
A survey found that registered voters prefer the Democratic House candidates more than the Republicans, with a ratio of 50 percent to 43 percent, but a decline remains compared to 14 percent points ahead in August.
Another poll by the National Broadcasting Agency (NBC) and the Wall Street Journal also showed that Democrats still lead the Republicans by seven percent points.
Obama said to the crowd on the occasion of Senator Don Noli’s protest: “When people don’t say the truth, when words no longer represent anything, there will be evil.
“When people can only lie out of themselves, democracy can’t work.”
“The only way to stop these Republicans is now you and your votes.”
The Democrat is facing the hardest election in the Senate in decades, and the Republican now holds the majority of 51 seats.
But the House of Representatives was more favorable, and the Democrat needs to win 23 more seats to be able to control the House of Representatives with 435 seats.
According to the analysts of the forecast election site FiveThirtyEight.com, the chances of the Democratic Party to win the House of Representatives are up to 85%.
The National Political Council held the important theoretical seminar of the Secretary-General Xi Jinping on the strengthening and improvement of the work of the People's Political Council.
The National Political Council held an important theoretical seminar on the strengthening and improvement of the work of the People's Political Council in Kyiv on 29-30 May.

He emphasized that the important idea of the Secretary-General Xi Jinping on strengthening and improving the work of the People's Political Coalition, deeply explained the role of the People's Political Coalition's status, objective tasks, responsibility missions, practical requirements, and scientificly answered a series of directional, global and strategic major questions, is a powerful ideological weapon to guide the work of the People's Political Coalition in the new era.
It is necessary to seriously learn to implement this important idea, to understand its major significance, rich content and spiritual essence, to truly learn to understand how to do real-world skills, to promote the quality of the work of the political association with the theoretical learning and the armed thought, and to effectively take on the new mission of the new era of the People's Political association.
On the 29th and 30th of September, the National Political Council held an important theoretical seminar of the Secretary-General Xi Jinping on the strengthening and improvement of the work of the People's Political Council in Beijing.
Since the 18th Congress of the Party, General Secretary Xi Jinping has proposed a series of new ideas and new views on strengthening and improving the work of the People's Political Coalition, for the first time has proposed that the People's Political Coalition is an important channel and special consulting institution of socialist and consulting democracy, is an important component of the state governance system, is a system arrangement with Chinese characteristics, for the first time explains the characteristics and advantages of the new type of political party system, emphasizes the correct treatment of consistency and diversity of the relationship, deeply reveals the truth of the people's democracy is that there are good discussions, the people's things are discussed by the people, reveals the logical connection of "China's governance" with the Chinese political system,
Wang Yan emphasized that political associations at all levels should use theoretical learning as an opportunity to further find the weaknesses and shortcomings of the political association work, in strengthening and improving the up-to-date skills and seeking breakthroughs.
It is necessary to fully strengthen the building of the Party in the Political Convention system, to ensure that the partial central decision-making implementation is continuously implemented in the work of the Political Convention.
It is necessary to strengthen the ide-political leadership, to improve the system, procedures and mechanisms of advisory finance and cohesion of the consensus, to implement the ide-political leadership to all aspects and the whole process of work.
The central task must be focused on fulfilling its duties, better obeying the service of the party and the state, improving the quality of advice and finance, and improving the effectiveness of fulfilling its duties.
It is necessary to strengthen the construction of the political association itself, to take the training of members and personnel, to play the basic role of the Special Committee, and to build the basis for the implementation of the functions of the political association.

Under the current wave of "Volkswagen Entrepreneurship, Volkswagen Innovation", more and more technology companies began to pay attention to patent research and related protection work, deepen the potential value of the patent and occupy the dominance of the market.
Similarly, there are many technology and technology companies that have suffered no small breach waves in patent technology authorisation, patent technology use, etc.
At the end of 2017, three people from Guangdong Province, Tandwa, Ho Chi Minh, and Rainbow, due to breach of patent rights, appealed the developers of the “Drop Drop” APP, Beijing Xiao Chung Technology Limited (hereinafter referred to as “Drop Drop Technology Limited”), Operator Drop Drop Drop Technology Limited (hereinafter referred to as “Drop Drop Drop”) and Seller Guangdong Pacific Internet Information Services Limited (hereinafter referred to as “Guangdong Pacific”) to the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
Three prosecutors requested a court ruling that the three prosecutors immediately cease the manufacturing, sale, promise sale and use of the prosecutor’s patent acts.
On October 30, 2018, the Chinese Judicial Document Network published the “Tanway, Ho Chi Minh, and others with Beijing Xiao Chiang Technology Limited and other violations of the patent rights dispute in the first trial civil ruling”, which revealed the details of some cases of the patent rights violation accused by Drop Drop APP.
Three prosecutors consider the patent rights and inventors of the "mobile terminal-based car service systems and methods" patents, while the entire operating process of the app "Drop Drop" app is in line with the technical program of patent protection involved, constituting a patent violation.
However, during the judgment of the court, Xi Jinping Technologies believed that Guangdong Pacific is not the suitable accused, it only provides on the internet the free download of the app "Drop Drop" involved, it does not implement the patent method involved, there is no direct or indirect violation of the rights, it should not be listed as the accused in the case.
Second, the place of the violation of the rights in the case is not in Guangdong.
In accordance with the provisions of the law, the breach of the patent in the case should be fully implemented by the place of the patent method in the case, therefore the court has objected to the jurisdiction, requiring the transfer of the case to the court of the place of residence of the defendant, the Beijing Court of Intellectual Property for trial.
The Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court believes that Guangzhou Pacific has provided app products on its online platform, and that it is not wrong that Guangzhou Pacific is listed as the accused.
The Guangzhou Pacific residence is in Guangzhou City and belongs to the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The accused called for the case to be transferred to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court for trial, on a lack of basis, rejected the objections submitted by the accused to the jurisdiction of the case, and will bear the costs of acceptance of the case of the objections of the jurisdiction.
Other proceedings in the case are not yet announced, and the journalists will also closely monitor the subsequent details of the patent breach.
Interview with Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Federal Scientific and Industrial Research Organization: Australian-Chinese technological cooperation results significant
“China’s science and technology has developed rapidly over the past few decades, and Australia and China’s two countries together in the field of science can rich results.”
Larry Marshall, Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Federal Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, said in an interview with the Chinese news agency in Beijing that cooperation between China and Australia in the field of technology, from addressing climate change to the "Sky Eye" project, is a vital opportunity.
As the largest national-level research institution in the Australian Federation, CSIRO has achieved numerous innovative research achievements in the fields of ocean, energy, biology, materials, astronomy and more.
CSIRO hasined close cooperation with research institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
“This is a period of lasting friendship, which includes a tradition of trust in the partner and long-term cooperation,” says Marshall.
In May of this year, China’s 500-metre diameter ball surface radio telescope – “China Sky Eye” installed the world’s first 19 wave L frequency receiver.
This is currently the most advanced 19 wave back source receiver internationally, developed by scientists from China and Australia.
Marshall said the successful development of the receiver is based on CSIRO’s technological accumulation for many years, and after the launch, the FAST will increase the speed by 5 to 6 times, while it will also expand more scientific observation targets.
“This is the strength of CSIRO’s contribution to FAST.”
In addition to the above cooperation, CSIRO also has close cooperation with Chinese research institutions in the field of construction of square kilometers of radio telescopes, research and development of new types of fuel technologies, energy saving and emissions reduction.
“First scientific research is often focused on a problem that is a hundred years later, and now it takes more research to solve the problem that is facing.”
Marshall believes that Australia and China are complementary in the field of scientific development, while both countries face a number of challenges in development.
For example, extreme weather occurs frequently in the world, drought and floods lead to food production decreases, and food shortage seriously affects human development.
Simultaneously, problems such as population explosions, aging and chronic diseases are also serious challenges that are facing today.
“The cooperation between Australia and China in recent years is mainly focused on solving these current difficulties.”
Marshall introduced that CSIRO and the Qingdao Marine Science and Technology National Laboratory jointly established the International Southern Hemisphere Ocean Research Center, its work focuses on observing the El Nino phenomenon and the Lannina phenomenon, researching the relationship between the two and extreme weather, and building the extreme weather warning facilities; CSIRO and the Central Academy jointly developed a new variety of grains to overcome extreme weather, and can also alleviate the food deficiency problem caused by extreme weather.
“In the present environment, technology and innovation is difficult to do alone, it takes very high costs and a lot of problems to be solved, so cooperation is important today.”
Marshall said that the closer cooperation, the more progress is likely to be achieved, which is also the importance of both Australian and Chinese sides to strengthen cooperation in the framework of the "Belt and Road".
“Strengthening bilateral cooperation is, for us, primarily in the field of technology.”
Marshall’s example is that CSIRO has recently developed a method of purification of gold that does not use cylinders, because the traditional method of purification of cylinders is very harmful to the environment, and many countries are hoping to find a method of purification of gold that is small to environmental pollution.
“We are willing to introduce this technology to China, which is one of the results of our participation in ‘Belt and Road’ cooperation.”

North Korean Foreign Minister Li Wanghao told the United Nations on Saturday that continuing to impose sanctions will deepen North Korea's uncertainty to the United States, and that it is impossible for North Korea to unilaterally give up nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Li Wanghao said at the United Nations General Assembly that the past year, North Korea has adopted "very friendly practices" including the cessation of missile and nuclear tests, the dismantling of nuclear test sites, and the promise not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“But we haven’t seen any corresponding response from the United States,” he said.
“If we don’t trust the United States, we don’t have confidence in our national security, in such a case we cannot first unilaterally give up weapons.”
Although Li Wanghao is repeatedly complaining North Korea against the U.S. against “phase-by-step” nuclear dismantling, his speech has a significant significance, because no one-sided rejection of nuclear dismantling, as it was before, has been a complete rejection.
Li Wanghao mentioned the joint statement of Kim Jong-un and Trump on June 12, when Kim Jong-un agreed on efforts towards the “Nuclear Disarmament” on the Korean Peninsula, while Trump promised to protect North Korea’s security.
North Korea has always sought to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says North Korea must first give up its nuclear weapons.
The United States also refused to relieve the demand for international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. is insisting on ‘the first de-nuclearization’ and increasing the pressure on sanctions to its objectives in a high-pressure way, and even refusing to publish the ‘declamation of the end of the war’,” Li Wanghao said.
“The idea that sanctions can make us wander and ask for forgiveness is that we don’t understand the people we dream of the day.
But the problem is that these continued sanctions deepen our uncertainty.”
Li Wanghao did not mention the President of the United States' second Turkey meeting plan mentioned earlier this week in the United Nations.
Instead, he emphasized Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon in three meetings in the past five months, saying, “If the other side of the nuclear disarmament is South Korea and not North Korea, then the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula will not become so stable.”
China has announced that it will reduce tariffs on imports for 1585 tax purposes from 1 November 2018.
Since this year, China has continued its initiative to reduce import duties.
On May 1, this year, the total reduction of drug taxes, will include anti-cancer drugs, all ordinary drugs and bioalcoholic drugs with anti-cancer effects, with actual imports of medicines and other 28 tax purposes of import tariffs will be adjusted to zero.
At the same time, it also significantly reduced the value added tax burden on the production and import of anti-cancer drugs.
On July 1, the tax will be reduced to 218 taxed cars and parts.
After the reduction of taxes, the China automotive total tax rate has been lower than the average level in developing countries, in accordance with the realities of China automotive industry.
This tax reduction will promote industry structural adjustment and resource optimization configuration, accelerate output, contribute to the improvement of the quality of products and services, and is expected to promote the price adjustment of cars to a certain extent, allowing consumers to get more affordable.
On July 1st, 1449 consumer goods were taxed for tax purposes.
The reduction of daily consumption goods is closely related to the needs of a good life of the people.
This reduction of the tax is not only a large number but a great force, the average reduction rate is 56%.
The daily reduction of consumer goods will directly benefit the large number of consumers and promote domestic industries to improve their competitiveness.
On November 1, the tax will be reduced on 1585 industrial goods such as mechanical electrical equipment, parts and raw materials for tax purposes.
The adequate reduction of import duties on some domestic urgent industrial goods, can attract more foreign investments, is favorable to increase domestic efficient supply, contributes to industry upgrades, while also helps enterprises allocate resources globally, reduces production costs, and is also favorable to reduce the pressure of domestic environmental transportation.
The relevant officials of the Office of the Customs and Customs Committee of the State Council of China presented that the above four independent tax cuts, as well as the third step of tax cuts implemented on July 1 according to the information technology agreement to expand the scope of negotiations, will reduce the total tariff level of China from 9.8% to 7.5% last year.
The overall tariff level after the adjustment is slightly higher than the EU, lower than the majority of developing countries, at a medium and low level, which is essentially matching the status and development stages of China.
The chief introduced that the total tariff level as one of the important indicators of the degree of openness in China’s trade in goods, should adapt to the stage of China’s economic development and reflect the characteristics of the time.
China's trade in goods is the world's first, has already a further expansion of the open economic basis, but the quality and efficiency of trade development remains a gap compared to the developed economies, and therefore, the total tariff level should be adequately reduced.
Tariffs are a means of compliance protection, the tariff level should adapt to industrial competitiveness, encourage good competition, excessive protection is not favorable to industrial development and improve quality.
The tariff rate adjustment should take into account the production and consumption needs.
The focus is on reducing domestic demand, contributing to the industrial transformation and upgrading of the goods tax rate, striving to increase the imports of goods with the characteristics of advantages compared to the demand of the people, constantly increasing the sensation of access to the enterprises and the public, and meeting the needs of upgrading of the industrial structure and the consumer structure.
The reduction of taxes should be combined with the sustainable capacity of financial income and industrial development.
On the choice of specific tax-down goods and tax-down scale, it is necessary to coordinate both domestic and foreign markets, up and down two aspects, production and consumption two relationships, and to maintain the dynamics of China’s economic stability and good development.
The chief stressed that this year is the 40th anniversary of the reform and opening, China’s initiative to reduce the total import tariff level is a major initiative made according to China’s own achievement of high-quality development needs, which is beneficial to the integration of the use of both international and foreign resources, to promote the quality of the domestic supply system and to meet the needs of the people’s consumer upgrade.
This action and initiative shows that China will firmly follow the open strategy of mutual benefit and win, firmly support economic globalization, firmly preserve the principles of free trade and the multilateral trade system in the core of the WTO, and will continue to take the power of development from open to the world, and will also make China’s development better beneficial to the world.
Serbia announces its highest warrant state: President of Serbia will meet tomorrow to discuss Kosovo situation
The news agency quoted the official office of the President of Serbia as saying that, given that Kosovo Special Forces occupied the corridor of the Gazivoda hydroelectric power plant, which is controlled by Belgrade in the north of Kosovo, the President of Serbia Wuchic ordered the country's armed forces to get into the highest warranty.
On September 29, the Minister of Defense of Serbia, Wulin, announced that the Serbian army has entered a complete war preparation.
Wulin emphasized that as long as the order issued by Wuchic remains effective, Serbia will continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo, regardless of the direction the situation develops, the Syrian armies will respond.
According to the Russian news agency, on September 29, Wuchic said in an interview that he has been informed of the current situation with the US-Russian and European parties and will travel to Moscow on October 2 to meet with Russian President Putin to seek support from Putin on the issue of Kosovo.
When asked whether Serbia needs Russian military support like Syria, Wuchic gave a negative answer: “I don’t want a major military conflict on our territory.”
Wuchic also said that the Syrian army had entered a complete warranty only to form a deterrence to prevent the conflict, but that was also a clear warning: it would surely not tolerate any violence in Kosovo.
The Syrian army's increase in war preparation has to do with two major actions on the part of Kosovo.
According to the Serbian side, in recent days, the Albanians are drastically arresting generations of Serbs living in the region in the northern part of Kosovo, and those arrested Serbs do not violate any law.
Wuchic said the situation in the region has been upgraded since the head of the office of the Serbian government in Kosovo and Metochia, Marco Yurich, was hit and arrested by the Kosovo Army on March 26, this year, and the Syrians have been unhumanly arrested and deported.
Furthermore, more than 100 people, including the Special Forces of the Ministry of the Interior of the Republic of Kosovo, the armed police and snipers, occupied the positions near the water reservoir Lake of the Gazivoda hydroelectric power plant, entered the ecological and sports center near the Northern Dam of the Kosovo region, and blocked all the roads nearby, which were originally controlled by the Serbs.
Wuchic pointed out that this military adventure operation in Kosovo was carried out under the control of the Western countries, the actions of the Kosovo army did not notify Serbia in advance, violated Chapter 9(1) of the Brussels Agreement, and also violated the resolution 1244 of the UN Security Council and the military and technical agreement between the CECO.
Wuchic has called to NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg to criticize the false speeches of the Western countries on the Kosovo issue.
The root of the current conflict remains the hundreds of years of historical complaints between the two Seas in the Kosovo region.
About Kosovo's membership, the Serbs and the Arabs have different statements.
Serbia sees Kosovo as the birthplace and culture of the nation, since Serbia established its strongest country in the 12th century, and the Arabs migrated massively to the north only after the Ottoman Empire invaded and the Serbs defeated.
The Arabs insisted that the primitive tribes of Illyria, which lived in Kosovo in the 4-5th century BC, were the ancestors of the Arabs, and therefore Kosovo has since ancient times been the territory of the Arabs.
The subjective political division has led to intense conflicts between different nations, religions and cultures, and has led to a severe conflict between Serbs and Arabs in Kosovo.
In 1912, Kosovo first declared independence of Albania.
After the First World War, a large number of Arabs living in the Balkan Peninsula moved to Turkey, and the proportion of the Serbs increased relatively, and the practice of the Serbs "just to take back their own land" was seen by the Arabs as a "grand-Serbian" robbery, and the two-racial contradictions intensified.
Kosovo has become the Balkan’s “firewall”.
In 1999, Albanian separatists in the Kosovo Liberation Army had armed conflicts with the Serbian army and police, resulting in NATO forces bombing the Southern Alliance of Serbia and Montenegro, and the Kosovo War exploded.
On February 17, 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia.
Though there has been reports that Serbia will normalize relations with Kosovo and sign a global and legally binding agreement, it has not been possible to sign a multilateral agreement undertaken by multilateral forces, such as the U.S. and the Russian Federation, due to historical national complaints and geopolitical wings.
Just a month ago, Wuchic for the first time clearly stated his proposal to isolate the Serbs and Arabs in Kosovo, and to reopen the conflict between the two races.
Electrical communications are still interrupted: Indonesian tsunami rescue difficulties
According to figures released by the Indonesian Disaster Rescue Agency, the intense earthquake and tsunami that occurred in the province of Guangzhou, in the southern province of Sulawesi, on Wednesday, caused the deaths of 420 people.

On September 29, 2018, a bridge collapsed by the earthquake and tsunami.
Due to the severe damage to electricity and communication facilities, the earthquake in Chongqing and the neighboring district of Sigi is still unconnected to the "isolated island" and the number of victims cannot be estimated.
The media that Vice President Kara said the number of deaths was up to thousands.
Electricity interruptions, communication interruptions, road interruptions, airport damages ... The rescue work after the strong earthquake and tsunami is difficult.
Due to electricity interruptions, some hospitals and rescue settlements in the city of Palu need fuel power.

Due to the damage to the towers and tracks in the earthquake at the Palu Airport, all commercial flights have been stopped and military aircraft have only been displaced for the transport of rescue equipment and personnel.
The Indonesian Minister for Political, Legal and Security Affairs, who commands the rescue in the earthquake area, Vilanto, has called for the rescue of electricity supply and commercial flight services at the airport as soon as possible to ensure the operation of rescue agencies such as hospitals, allowing more rescue personnel and volunteers and aid equipment to be transported to the earthquake area.

In 2014, the city had only 12 companies related to the digital economy and the internet, and in the third quarter of this year, it has already over 500.
This is a shadow of the development of the digital economy in Utah.
The Internet Congress was held, allowing local enterprises to receive the inspiration of the digital economy, the digital wave, the desire to transform and upgrade enterprises is strong, and traditional manufacturing enterprises have increased investments and research in the fields of machine exchange, intelligent management and so on.

The development of the digital economy cannot be separated from the support of infrastructure.
This year, U Town launched 5G pilot work on the basis of achieving 4G communication networks and free Wi-Fi full coverage.
At the same time, Kyiv City, which is located in U Town, as the country’s first county-level city to build the international Internet data special channel, has also become a hot land for the development of the Internet industry.
Since the first World Internet Congress, Kyiv has introduced 565 digital economy projects, planned total investment of 377.25 billion yuan, the digital economy core manufacturing industry in the first three quarters of this year has achieved the total output value of 87.3 billion yuan, increased value of 13 percent.
“First U Town was a tourism symbol, later more theatrical and cultural symbols. because of the Internet Congress, it is now again a symbol of the Internet and the digital economy.”
The Secretary of the Kyiv City Committee, Xi Jinping, believes that the interest of the World Internet Congress is accumulated over time, therefore, it is also more necessary to build a platform, to take over the supervision of the elements of talents, projects, technologies and other parties.
Kyungun Qinghai has been working abroad for 20 years, because of the association with the Internet Congress, returning to the country to enterprise.

In China, the survival rate of premature births of 29 weeks and older has reached 98% and has reached the level of developed countries.
China's National Children's Medicine Center and Repeat University Affiliate Children's Hospital on September 30 announced its introduction of Canada's advanced methods in the title "China's NICU Hospital Pregnancy Pregnancy Quality Improvement Project".
The results of the project show that after active treatment, China’s early birth survival rate reached 98% and has reached the level of developed countries, but the early birth survival rate and the early birth survival rate without complications are still greatly improved.
For almost 20 years, the Chinese government has been focusing on the rescue of newborns.
Currently, the infant death rate in the Shanghai region has decreased to 3.71 ‰, significantly lower than the national average, reaching advanced levels in developed countries.
The “China NICU Hospital Pregnancy Pregnancy Quality Improvement Project” has passed 4 years of unreliable efforts to significantly improve the quality of premature child survival.
Professor Cao Yun, Director of the Newborn Heavy Disease Surveillance Room (NICU) at the University of Rihanna, told reporters that while improving the survival rate of premature child, focus on reducing the quality of survival of premature child, reducing the incidence of complications, improving the prognosis of nerve development, improving the overall end of the patient child, to improve the overall survival quality of premature child and the quality of the population, is an important issue of the attention of the domestic and foreign pediatric community and the newborn pediatric community, and also the key issue of this project.
The “China NICU Hospital Pregnancy Pregnancy Quality Improvement Project” has passed 4 years of unbeatable efforts to collect tens of thousands of pregnancy aged 33 weeks and below in the country, which has reduced the mortality rate of pregnancy aged 1/3, while the incidence of severe complications of pregnancy has significantly decreased, significantly improved the quality of survival of pregnancy.
The project, by establishing a national network of cooperation to improve the quality of newborns, introducing the concept of cooperative quality improvement, radiates 25 cooperative hospitals across China, establishes a set of cooperative improvement methods suitable for domestic circumstances to improve premature birth forecast, improve the level of newborn rescue, complete, systematic and effective cooperative quality improvement methods.
The Rihanna University affiliate pediatric hospital is joining the national newborn pediatric forces, based on the project’s accumulated experience, developing newborn infection diagnosis guidelines, providing reference and guidance for standard diagnosis of newborn infection in China.
It is known that in the "China Pregnancy Pregnancy Quality Improvement Project", Pediatric Hospital introduced the EPIQ method in 25 large NICUs in 19 provinces of the country, committed to solving the problem of premature child infection in China's newborn care rooms.
Over the course of more than 10 years of continuous improvement, Canada’s national uncomplicated survival rate has increased by about 1 per cent, and Canada is now one of the best countries in the world for premature birth.
The EPIQ method has now been applied to all NICUs across Canada and has been adopted by six countries.
The Pediatric Hospital revealed that the results of the study showed that two years after the EPIQ intervention, premature infection decreased by 35%, while the use of antibiotics decreased by 20%.
In the future, Rihanna University affiliate pediatric hospitals will continue to promote and implement this method across the country, focusing on a comprehensive reduction of the incidence of all complications in premature childbirth and improving the quality of rescue in the country.
Currently, the level of rescue in various regions of China, however, is a fact that there are differences and inequality.
As an important construction unit of the National Children's Medical Center, Pediatric Hospital will play a leading radiation role, this study covers several western provinces, including Xinjiang, Guangzhou, Gansu, Shenzhen, in order to gradually promote the homogeneization and normalization of newborn healing across the country.
It is understood that Rihanna University affiliate pediatric hospital is joining the national newborn pediatric forces, according to the project accumulated experience, developing newborn infection diagnosis guidelines, providing reference and guidance for standard diagnosis of newborn infection in China.
According to the report, in 2019, the coordination center, located in China's newborn cooperation network at the Rihanna University affiliate pediatric hospitals, will joint 63 hospitals in the country to carry out the next phase of national quality improvement in order to promote the uniform development of the level of rescue of newborn children in China.
The Director of the Shanghai City Health and Health Committee said that Shanghai can become the center of Asia, not only reflect in research, the construction of the entire service system, the quality of the service and the results of the service should have a place in Asia, and thus truly reflect the medical level of China.
The “Hero Memorial” – written on the Fifth Martyrs Memorial Day.
On 30 September, in the presence of the Republic’s 69th anniversary, we welcomed the fifth martyr commemoration day, and party and state leaders such as Xi Jinping came to Tiananmen Square to attend the ceremony of honouring the people’s hero.
At this moment, wherever you are, please congratulate the Inner.
The Day of Resurrection is the Day of Resurrection and the Day of Resurrection is the Day of Resurrection.
Opening the heavy history, behind the name of every martyr, is a living life.
They, too, have a hot youth, a sincere love, a family involved.
However, because they strongly believe that “the faithfulness of us is the truth of the universe”, they are willing to sacrifice everything of their own in order to “deal from the suffering of the next generation.”
“One day I will survive and one day I will scream for China.”
Through the time space, the intelligents set up a spiritual pathmark, guiding the direction forward.
“Where to go, where to go, where to go, where to go, where to go, where to go, where to go, where to go, where to go, where to go, where to go.”
Remembering the intensity, the most important thing is to build a "Hero Monument" in the heart.
According to incomplete statistics, since the years of the revolutionary war, about 20 million martyrs have dedicated themselves to the national independence, the people’s liberation, and the state’s wealthy and heroic courage.
For many reasons, many predecessors did not even leave their names.
In many instincts the ideal is swallowed with blood, with life practicing faith, remembering their English names, inheriting their spirit, which is protecting the roots and souls of the nation.
This “Hero Monument” is not allowed to be damaged or destroyed.
For a period of time, the dark flows of historical nihilism and entertainment have flowed.
All kinds of practices that distort history, degrad the harshness, challenge the conscience of justice, distort the judgment of values, and cause public anger and awareness in the whole society.
The hero cannot forget, the hero cannot forget.
The actions of touching the bottom line, which cannot be heard, must dare to light the sword, and to defend the courtesy of dignity with the rule of law and justice.
On 1 May this year, the Hero Martyrs Protection Act was officially enforced.
From the point of view of the judicial practice, the judgment of some cases is very fast, both according to the law effectively preserving the bright image, and releases the positive energy of worship and worship of the hero.
A nation with a pursuit cannot be without a hero, a country with an ideal cannot be without a pioneer.
Remembering the pretext, calling the hero, has become a universal social consensus.
Currently, there are millions of different memorial facilities in the country, with more than one million people visiting the martyrs' mountains every year.
The human heart is the strongest foundation.
Let the worship of the hero, the defense of the hero, the learning of the hero, the care of the hero, and the heart of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit.
Reuters Brussels September 28 - After Italy has neglected the EU's demands to shock the market by the massive budget deficit plan, the EU took a non-conflict position against Italy on Friday, but the EU might take a more radical position if Italy adhered to a too bold goal.
Italy claims that the EU’s budget deficit is equal to 2.4 per cent of GDP in the next three years, indicating that there is no debt cuts in the next three years.
The Executive Commissioner for Economic Affairs of the European Commission, Moskovici, said on Friday, “We are not interested in the crisis between the Executive Commission and Italy,” as the EU’s recommendations and sanctions may have no impact on Italy, he took a cautious response.
EU officials and diplomats still hope that market forces will be able to convince Italy to adjust its budget plans before it is formally submitted to the European Commission in October.
After the government announced its plans, the euro fell to the lowest level for almost two weeks on Friday, while the Italian bond revenue reached the highest level for three weeks.
If the deficit targets remain unchanged until the end of October, the European Commission may reject the Italian budget draft, a thing that the Commission has never done to any country.
European Commission Executive Vice-President East Blowsky later said on Friday at a meeting in the Latvian capital Riga that Italy’s current budgetary plan “particularly does not match the Stability and Growth Convention,” he referred to the EU’s budgetary regulations.
But he did not say what this would cause the European Union to react.
The tenderers may submit applications for participation in this open tender before October 26.
The Russian Ministry of Agriculture has previously identified China as one of the priority markets for exports of Russian agricultural products.
In May, the Russian Agricultural Supervisory Authority announced that this agricultural year the export of Russian food to China for the first time exceeded a million tons, a record of innovation.
The agency predicts that China may be among the top ten Russian food importers.

The Chinese women's ranking coach Rong Ping said after the match, the whole game was not easy.
“We’re prepared more well, we’re well-established, the Turkish team’s technology is more comprehensive, we have to reduce errors and try to win through our own initiative score.”
In the face of old-known team members, Zhuen, who played in the Turkish Wakiwar Bank team, was subjected to a lot of restrictions in the first round of the match that day, then she initially sought a change and still played a strong attack.
“The opponents are familiar with each other, being observed by the opponents is normal, but the Chinese team plays to the extreme, in the uncomfortable circumstances, the block and attack play well.”
The next Chinese women will take a day of cease-war, physical and technical training; on October 2 they will face the third opponent of the group competition, Canada.

The Chinese Academy of Engineering acknowledges the tree quickly.
Xinjiang is China's most important cotton production area, according to the statistics of the National Bureau of Statistics, in 2017 Xinjiang cotton cultivation area was 35 million hectares, representing 61% of the national cotton area.
Since the introduction of the film in China in 1982, the area of the film of various crops in the Xinjiang region has reached more than 50 million hectares, and the film's annual use is approximately 300,000 tons.
Among them, the cotton membrane coverage rate reaches 100%, and the cotton membrane accounts for about 60% of the Xinjiang membrane use.
Without membrane cotton to be measured, cotton production can entirely 320 kg to 350 kg of hectares.
With the continuous increase in the amount of Xinjiang membrane input, the remaining membrane recycling rate is low, the amount of membrane in the soil increases gradually, the membrane causes a series of problems, such as the damage to the soil structure, seriously affect agricultural sustainable development.
The membrane not only causes severe pollution to the soil, but also has a significant impact on the quality of cotton fiber.
Currently, more than one-third of Xinjiang cotton fields have achieved mechanized recovery.
In 2017, Xinjiang machine cotton area was approximately 14 million hectares.
Mechanical cotton harvesting processes generate large amounts of surface, cotton stones, the cotton stones in the primary cotton are difficult to clean up in the process of the primary cotton processing, in the subsequent textile processing process cannot be completely cleaned, seriously affecting the quality of textile products.
On 28 September, the national non-film cotton live observation and seminar exchange activities took place in Xinjiang Shaya County.
In order to focus on solving cotton field membrane pollution, simplifying cotton technology, improving cotton field efficiency, the Cotton tree quickly led his team through 8 years of time, implementing "Cotton 619" non-membrane cotton technology cultivation, "adding wings" for Xinjiang agriculture green development.
Through the innovative cultivation of new ideas, it has grown a special early mature, resistant to salt alkali, resistant to low temperature and rich-produced land cotton new category "Central Cotton 619".
In the conditions of non-film cultivation in the southern region of Xinjiang, ‘Cin Cotton 619’ has achieved a series of support measures, such as non-film planting mechanics, the depilation depth improvement, the drop pipe under non-film conditions, the appropriate fertilization density screening, and reasonable chemical control.
Currently, Exo, Kurler, Aral and others have established a non-membrane cotton demonstration base, with a production of 4,800 kg per hectare.
Cotton cultivation without membrane, achieved abundant production, savings, environmental protection, increased overall efficiency.
Zhang Zhang Hai, a farmer at the third department of the Xinjiang Manufacturing and Construction Army, said that through 6 years of research and demonstration of the technology of non-film cotton cultivation, the production of non-film cotton seeds can fully an hectare production of 320 kg to 350 kg, and may be even higher.
“The prospects for the promotion of non-film cotton cultivation technology are great.”
Zhang Qinghai believes that at the moment, the non-film cotton cultivation technology can completely solve the problem of soil membrane pollution, but the current economic efficiency compared to soil membrane cultivation still has a certain gap.
“Supporting the purchase price of cotton will be beneficial for future promotion.”
He said the next step, he and his team will continue to do deep research on non-film cotton and large area promotion applications, make the non-film cotton industry big and strong, and completely solve the problem of soil pollution caused by the soil.

Chinese people have never had any external genes.
We believe that countries can live together in harmony and communicate with each other.
Regardless of the past, the present and the future, China will not take on foreign patterns, nor will it require other countries to copy China’s practice.

China is always committed to developing long-term healthy and stable relations between China and the United States, to non-conflict, non-conflict, mutual respect, cooperation and win.

The new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement will retain the ability of U.S. President Trump to implement a 25% tariff threat on imported cars, while making passenger cars, pick-up and car parts imported from Canada and Mexico basically exempt from tariffs.
If Trump imposes the so-called "Chapter 232" tariffs on cars for national security reasons, both Mexico and Canada will have a quota of 2.6 million passenger vehicles exported to the United States annually.
In accordance with the attached arrangements, picas produced in both countries will be fully exempt from tariffs.
If Trump imposes tariffs on cars, Mexico will receive $18 billion tax exemption per year and Canada will receive $32.4 billion tax exemption.
Both quotas are far higher than the current production level of the two countries, providing space for growth for both countries’ exports.
Reuters Washington/Mexico September 28 - Mexico said on Friday that after a few days of debate, the U.S. President Trump’s government and Canada are making effective efforts to solve trade policy differences, making the outside world dream of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) hopeful to maintain the form of a three-party agreement.
Despite the lack of details, the obvious progress above is sufficient to encourage the Mexican and U.S. government to suddenly stop the plans to publish the two-party trade agreement text, giving Canada more time to join the agreement.
Mexican president candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told reporters in Mexico that the U.S. government has presented new anti-recommendations to the Canadian government and said he will continue to encourage all three countries to participate in the NAFTA.
Mexican economic minister Ildefonso Guajardo said the time to submit the text of the trade agreement between the two sides to the Mexican and U.S. legislation was delayed because Canada and the U.S. government were “very seriously” trying to reach an agreement.
Guahardo said, “In the next 48 hours, we will know whether we have reached a text of a three-party agreement or whether we have to publish the text of a two-party agreement.”
Guahardo said his U.S. and Canadian officials "specially requested" to delay the publication of the text.
A spokesman for the US Trade Representative Office (USTR) has not commented on the text of the US-Mexico Trade Agreement and the US-Canada consultations.
Officials in the Office of the Prime Minister of Canada and the Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to the request for feedback on the counter-suggestions.
According to foreign media, in a caring center in the suburbs of the capital of South Africa, Bitoria, two small lions play together, it’s hard to see any unusual things, but they’re not just there.
The University of Peltoria announces: “This is the first young lion to be born by artificial fertilization – the first pair in the world.”
Scientists at the campus are working to study the reproductive system of the mother African lions.
Ganswint, director of the University of Beltoria Mammoth Institute, said the two young lions born on August 25 were fairly healthy and normal.
His team, after 18 months of intense trials, finally achieved this breakthrough.
Ganswint said in a visit to the media: “We collect sperm from a healthy lion.”
Next, the researchers performed artificial fertilization for it when the hormone content in the body of the mother lion reached the appropriate level.
Gansworth said, “Fortunately, the result was successful.”
He said the researchers “do several attempts, but unexpectedly, they didn’t spend too much effort.”
He said the previous research breakthroughs can be repeatedly verified, and scientists hope to use this technology to rescue large cat animals on the risk of extinction.
The International Union for Natural Care notes that the lions have been extinct in 26 countries in Africa, with the total number of wild lions surviving decreased by 43% in the last 20 years, with only about 20,000 remaining.
African lions are classified as dangerous animals.
Gansworth said, “If we don’t do anything for these animals, they’ll face disappearance.”
He said this new technology doesn’t need to allow the lions to be raised, but only to inject sperm into the pregnant mother lions, just as the North American and European approaches are taken to raise the elephant.
South Korea’s export decline in September was the largest in more than two years, but analysts blame the decline for fewer working days and said the global demand for South Korean goods remains strong despite the rising trade tensions.
In fact, South Korea's average daily exports increased last month.
Furthermore, earlier-published initial value data show that exports had two-digit growth in the first few weeks of September before the long holiday.
South Korean exports in September fell to the highest since July 2016, with a decrease greater than the revenue estimated by Reuters’ 11 analysts.
The initial value announced on Monday shows that exports in September amounted to $50.6 billion, lower than $512.2 billion in August.
Despite concerns that increasing U.S. and China trade disputes may lead to other Chinese neighbors who depend on exports, South Korea’s exports to China increased by 7.8 percent in September, the 23rd month in a row.
South Korean exports to the U.S. fell by 11.8%, due to a decline in oil sales.
South Korean memory chips and oil products overseas sales have grown by 28.3% and 13.5%, respectively, despite the market concerns that the so-called “super cycle” of chips may have reached the top.
However, the impact of the trade conflict will be difficult to avoid, as South Korea’s exports depend significantly on the US and Chinese markets.”
Imports fell 2.1% to $40.8 billion, less than a growth of 3.1% estimated by Reuters survey.
The initial trade surplus in September was $9.7 billion, higher than $9.9 billion in August.
The Ministry of Industry said, thanks to the gifts of the United States and the EU countries, the global manufacturing industry will remain prosperous, which is a beneficial factor for South Korean exports.
The statement notes that “the increase in export prices caused by oil prices will also benefit exports in the second half of this year.”
“But the continued trade conflict between the United States and China, along with the increased volatility of the market after the U.S. interest rates, are the negative pressure faced by exports.”
The average exports per working day increased to $2.6 billion in September and $2.1 billion in August.
South Korea's mid-summer festival falls on 24-26 September this year, so September has only 19.5 working days, four days less than the same period last year.
South Korea-September exports increased 4.7% compared to the same period last year.
According to the Japanese/Markit Purchasing Managers Index, South Korean manufacturing activity rebounded in September, but was supported by domestic orders, as orders from China and Japan fell, which threatens other export prospects to cover the shadows.
North Korean media criticises U.S. not to relieve sanctions against Korea
The North Korean Labour News on September 30 issued a signed commentary that criticized the U.S. seeking dialogue with the North Korean Republic while not relieving the sanctions against the North Korean Republic, calling it a "self-contraind" practice.
According to the article, U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo said on Thursday that “the key to achieving the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is the implementation of sanctions against the Korean Peninsula,” stressing the U.S. position of continuing to implement the UN sanctions resolution is unchanged.
In a joint statement in Singapore, the two sides undertake to establish a new North American relationship that fits the desires of peace and prosperity of the people of the two countries.
The United States, on the one hand, increases the pressure on sanctions and, on the other hand, requires dialogue, which is undoubtedly contradictory.
If we want to build a new Korean-American relationship, build a permanently consolidated peace system on the Korean Peninsula, and the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, we should put building trust in the first place, starting with what can be done, and solving it step by step.
The article also said the U.S. should understand that the imposition of sanctions on North Korea is not effective.
The article says that even the "North DeVinsk" before the "Kasan" was also admiring the U.S. military.
The National Interest magazine quotes the US Navy’s point of view: “We’ll face a powerful potential opponent.
The current commander-general of the U.S. Navy in the European Navy, Fogo, also honored the “North DeVinc” submarine.
Looking at the development of the Russian Navy, how it uses resources, you will know that its main efforts in the field of research and development are first to strengthen the submarine fleet.”
But the National Interest magazine still believes that the United States retains its advantage over Russia in this field.
Fogo said, “I believe that the Western countries still have an unparalleled advantage.”
It was previously that the Russian Navy will list the "Kasan" submarine in 2019.
"Kasan", "New Siberia", "Krasnoyarsk" and "Alhangelsk" multi-purpose submarines are all "White Candle Tree-M" improved type, with a waste volume of 13,800 tons, underwater depths of 520 meters, staff prepared for 64 people, underwater shipping speed of 31 degrees, will be carrying water mines, fish mines and "course" and "Tommarin" cruise missiles.

This was the first time he attended the forum.
Ignoring the threat of America.
The EU will conclude an agreement with Iran on crude oil purchases.
The U.S. government has announced that it will reboot a new round of sanctions against Iran in November, even calling on other countries to reduce oil imports to Iran.
But the U.S. allies seemed not to listen.
According to the U.S. New York Times, Iran’s Foreign Minister Zarif said in an interview that despite the threat of the U.S. to sanction any country doing business with Iran, Tehran is approaching an agreement with the EU on the sale of crude oil.
The main objective of the agreement is to try to create a new payment mechanism, that is, to replace the dollar transactions by means of easy-to-country or currency calculation.
The aim of this approach is to want to escape the U.S. and prevent the U.S. from blocking financial transfers.
At the same time, while the EU is committed to promoting the agreement, some French and British officials are also concerned that if the agreement is achieved, it will be the most openly confronted between the EU and the United States against the US withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear agreement.
In an hour interview, Zarif’s words sounded more optimistic than in recent months.
Because the agreement has the ability to “deparate” the traditional U.S. allies and effectively break the action of the U.S. trying to cut Iran’s income.
“This will ensure that we sell oil and benefit,” Zarif said, according to the agreement signed in 2015, the countries have the legitimate right to trade with Iran.
EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said: “No sovereign state or organization can accept others to decide with whom they can trade.”
However, she also predicts that, before the U.S. government launches the next step of sanctions in November, the U.S. leaders will be able to take a series of financial measures aimed at banks, and countries that have commercial transactions with Tehran.
In May this year, the U.S. government unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear agreement due to a failure in the agreement and said the agreement could not permanently prohibit Iran from producing nuclear fuel.
The US threatens to ban companies that buy Iranian oil and other goods from operating in the United States.
This threat caused some companies to withdraw from Tehran, with Iran’s currency falling.
Companies such as Airbus and French oil giant Doodle have canceled billions of dollars in investment in Iran.
British and French officials have said that the U.S. government could “take up the wind.”
Unfortunately, according to a recent Turkish media report, the U.S. sanctions seem not to have a significant impact on Iran’s oil exports.
Iran's oil minister Zhangai said no other country except South Korea stopped buying Iranian oil.
Zarif and Iranian President Rouhani both believe that a series of actions by the U.S. are aimed at “triving” Iran to violate the agreement.
Zarif also disregarded a series of oral attacks by the U.S., and when asked whether the U.S. would overthrow the current Iranian government with increasing financial pressure, Zarif even laughed, “It’s a strategy of regime change, that’s the true purpose of the U.S.”

The journalists learned from the National Health Committee that compared to several decades ago, the rate of malnutrition in children and adolescents in China decreased, and the rate of overweight obesity increased significantly.
The experts pointed out thatining a healthy weight, the most important concept is "healing without illness" and promoting scientific fitness and reasonable diet.
According to the “Central Information and Relevance of China’s Adolescent Health Education” (2018 edition), the key toining healthy weight is reasonable diet and scientific exercise.
Overweight, obesity and blind weight loss are not beneficial to health.
The health hazards behind “small fat” should not be ignored.
In a statement from China’s Center for Disease Prevention Control and Nutrition and Health, Ding Steel Jung said that overweight is harmful to adolescent’s normal growth and development, has negative effects on their psychology, behavior, cognitive and intellectual, and can even lead to high blood pressure, high blood sugar and high blood fat in children.
At the same time, overweight obesity in adolescents can last until adulthood, which will increase the risk of chronic diseases such as high blood pressure and diabetes in adolescents after adulthood.
In 2010-2012, China’s population’s nutrition and health status tests showed that China’s 6-17-year-old youth overweight rate was 9.6%, obesity rate was 6.4%, and both combined 16%.
At the same time, children and adolescents overweight obesity features boys higher than girls, cities higher than rural, and overweight obesity rates have increased significantly in recent decades.
How do teenagers deal with overweight?
Zhang Yi, Deputy Director of the Science Fitness and Health Promotion Research Center of the National Sports Administration, said that the main cause of obesity in adolescents is because of excess calorie intake and lack of physical activity.
For this simplicity of obesity, the focus should be on scientific exercise along with reasonable dietary control.
Zhang points out thatining healthy weight, the most important concept is "healing without illness", which is an important part of which is to conduct a comprehensive cop education for schools, parents and students, to spread the hazards of overweight and obesity, and to increase the preventive awareness of teenagers.
Adolescents should have regular medical examinations, monitor growth and development indicators such as high weight, and early detection and scientific judgment of whether overweight and obesity problems occur, in order to take timely intervention measures.
For adolescents who are already overweight, Ding Steel strongly recommends that, in addition to actively scientifically arranging diet and exercise, adolescents are in a special physiological stage, should avoid using hunger or semi- hunger therapy to control and lose weight, and should not blindly take weight loss drugs.
Reuters 28 September - Facebook (FB.O) said on Friday that hackers stole digital landing codes, allowing them to access 50 million user accounts, involving unprecedented face-to-face, which is its biggest security fault ever.
Facebook has more than 2.2 billion monthly users, saying it is unclear whether the attackers have misused any accounts or steal personal information.
The company did not find the locations of the hackers, nor was it sure if the hackers were targeted on a specific victim.
Its initial analysis shows that it was a large-scale attack.
CEO Zuckerberg said the incident was “really serious” in a media telephone conference.
A spokesman for the company said his account as well as the account of operating manager Sheryl Sandberg were also affected.
Facebook’s stock price dropped 2.6% on Friday, dragging the main Wall Street stock index.
A U.S. parliamentary member said on Friday that the attack could increase the noise of the outside world on data privacy legislation.
“This is another sad evidence that Congress needs to take action to protect the privacy and security of social media users,” Democratic Senator Mark Warner said in a statement.
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) member Rohit Chopra said on Twitter that I hope to get a response to Reuters' reports of this security defect.

In September, China's total PMI ratio increased and manufacturing PMI ratio dropped.
The data published by the National Bureau of Statistics of China show that in September, China's Comprehensive PMI Production Index was 54.1%, higher than the previous month and annual average of 0.3 and 0.1 percentage points, indicating that China's enterprise production operational activity in general remained stable.
In that month, the manufacturing production index and non-producing business activity index, which constitutes the integrated PMI output index, were 53.0% and 54.9%, respectively, a drop of one litre.
Of these, China manufacturing PMI was 50.8%, and the round ratio fell 0.5 percent points.
Zhao Qinghai said that this month the manufacturing PMI has five main features:
The basic aspect of manufacturing is generally stable.
In the 21 industries surveyed, the PMI in 14 industries was in the expansion zone, with the manufacturing PMI in medicine, special equipment, electrical machinery and other industries at a higher operating level of over 53.5%, with faster growth.
The second is a small variation of demand.
The production index and the new order index were 53.0% and 52.0%, down 0.3 and 0.2 percentage points, respectively, compared to the previous month, and the supply continued to keep the situation, but the expansion was slightly slowed.
The new export orders and import index were 48.0% and 48.5%, respectively lower than 1.4 and 0.6 percentage points last month, and the climate fell to the lowest in the year.

The main raw materials purchase price index was 59.8%, increased by 1.1 percentage points compared to last month, the factory price index was 54.3%, with the last month staying, all the highest points in the year.
The fifth is that large enterprises operate well, and the operating situation of small enterprises continues to improve.
Large enterprise PMI is 52.1%, with the last month stable, since this year the index has always been in the 52.0% and above expansion range, and this month the production index and the new order index ratio have increased, is the main driving force for manufacturing to keep expansion; medium enterprise PMI is 48.7%, lower than the previous month 1.7 percentage points, located in the crash range; small enterprise PMI is 50.4%, higher than the previous month 0.4 percentage points, two consecutive months of rise.
In that month, China's non-productive trade activity index was 54.9%, rising 0.7 percentage points compared to the previous month, rebounding for two consecutive months.
Zhao Qinghai believes that the non-production industry as a whole continues to maintain a stable and good development momentum.
The trade activity index in the industries such as road transport, securities, real estate continues to be below the critical point and the total business volume has decreased.
Nagoya, 5 November - Japan's central bank's chairman, Haida Toniya, said on Monday that the central bank is aware that the long-term implementation of ultra-release monetary policy could suppress the profit rate of financial institutions and could ruin the stability of the country's banking system.
But he said, given the low inflation and the uncertainty of the foreign economies, the Central Bank of Japan needs to maintain its large-scale stimulation plans while closely monitoring its policies’ disadvantages.
“Japan’s central bank fully acknowledges that the strength of the financial institutions will be increasingly affected under the continued monetary relief,” Mr. Shandong said in a speech to Nagoya’s corporate leaders.
He said if financial institutions take risks more actively to compensate for the effects of decreased profits over the years, the banking system may be disrupted once a serious negative impact occurs.
“Al these risks are not large at the moment, the central bank will closely monitor the developments of the situation and encourage financial institutions to take the necessary measures,” he said.
The records of the Japan Central Bank meeting, published earlier on Monday, showed that the Japan Central Bank Policy Committee discussed the cost of a long-term relief policy that continued to rise.
Meeting records show that one member said that if the economy continues to expand, “Japan’s central bank will have more flexible space in the future in terms of policy.”
Meeting records show that another member said that, given its limitations for the duration of the policy, the committee should discuss how long the Central Bank of Japan can maintain the stimulation policy.
The Central Bank of Japan will evaluate the financial risks brought by the relief policy, while also considering the uncertainty surrounding the Japanese economic prospects, due to China-American trade friction and increasing protectionism, which may affect global demand.
“The influence of such issues on the Japanese economy is temporarily limited,” said Haida Toniya.
“But how the problem continues, the impact on the Japanese economy may increase,” he added.
“It is necessary to conduct a strong monetary relief policy on a continuous basis while considering both positive and negative effects in a balanced way,” he said.
Despite the increased disadvantages of the radical stimulation program, such as the long-term low interest rate eroding the profits of financial institutions, the low inflation has forced the Japanese central bank to maintain the program.
Japan's central bankined its monetary policy last month; facing the risks of a global trade war conflict, Shandong eliminated the possibility of recent interest rise.
On June 1, 2018, the Cardiff, the U.S. Tesla Electric Vehicle Company labeled.
According to a settlement agreement, Tesla and its CEO, Musk, have agreed to pay $20 million in fines to the financial regulators each, and Musk will also resign from the company’s chairman, but will continue to be the CEO.
The reconciliation agreement will draw the figure for Tesla’s two-month turmoil.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Saturday revealed the accusation of securities fraud and reconciliation agreement, which will reassure investors.
Investors were worried that a long-lasting legal dispute would only continue to hit the still losing electric car company.
SEC accused Musk of fraud on Thursday, saying its tweet on August 7 misleading investors.
According to Twitter, he is considering to privatise Tesla for $420 per share and has been funded.
The SEC said the tweet was indeed unfounded and the market turmoil it caused damaged investors.
Investors and corporate governance experts say the agreement could boost Tesla’s serious injuries due to Musk’s recent behavior.
Stephen Heim, head of Boston Common Asset Management, said the reconciliation agreement should make Musk more supervised while not taking “destructive” measures to remove him from Tesla.
The asset management company owns Tesla’s battery manufacturer Panasonic’s shares.
According to the proposed agreement, Tesla must appoint an independent chairman, two independent directors and a board of directors to develop control over Musk’s external communication.
“This issue has been quickly resolved in accordance with the agreed conditions that meet the greatest interests of our markets and our investors, including Tesla’s shareholders,” SEC chairman Clayton said in a statement.
The charges on Thursday resulted in Tesla’s market value stepping around $7 billion, the company’s market value on Friday was $45.2 billion, lower than the General Motors’ $47.5 billion.
In the settlement agreement, the SEC recalled the request to remove Musk from the company's headquarters.
Many investors say that the punishment would be catastrophic.
“I think that’s the best possible result for all those involved,” said Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners, who gave Tesla a “neutral” rating and called the SEC’s punishment for Musk “from a mild punishment.”
“He’s still a CEO that’s important to Tesla.”
Neither Musk nor Tesla recognized nor denied the accusations of the SEC in the settlement agreement, nor immediately responded to the request for comment.
The reconciliation agreement must still be approved by the court.

Indonesian earthquake and tsunami kills 420 people, no Chinese citizens have been
The Indonesian official agency Antalya News, citing the figures published by William Rampangilei, the head of the country’s disaster rescue agency, said the number of deaths caused by the severe earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian central province of Sulawesi has risen to 420 people.
The official said this is just the statistics of the city of Palu, the capital of the central Sulawesi province, not including the Gonga County and the nearby Sigi area, as the two areas are still interrupted and the number of victims has not yet been.
Because many roads in the city of Palu were seriously damaged, heavy machinery was difficult to access, and search and rescue work was very difficult.

The Secretary-General Xi Jinping gave a very important speech at the private enterprise meeting, and inserted a firm confidence in the private economy toward a wider stage.
The Secretary-General Xi Jinping emphasized that "to let entrepreneurs remove the thought burden and make it easy to move forward" caused a strong resonance among the wide range of entrepreneurs and innovative entrepreneurs.
The dynamics of the market come from people, especially from entrepreneurs, from the spirit of entrepreneurship.
During the 40 years of reform and opening, there are tens of millions of entrepreneurs who start innovation stories, the growth of entrepreneurial groups grows and continues to drive the breakthrough of the Chinese economy forward.
For a long time, some people in society have issued some denial and doubtful statements about the private economy.
The so-called “Private Economy Displacement Theory” and “New Public and Private Joint Business Theory” errors raise some entrepreneurs concerns and concerns.
Recently, some private enterprises have faced many difficulties and problems in business development.
For example, the changes in the international economic environment have an impact on some export companies; the rapid adjustment of the demand structure leads to the pressure of transformation and upgrading; some policies do not coordinate each other, the policy effects are overwhelming, or the way of work is simple, leading to some initials that good policies have the opposite role, and so on.
Several factors are mixed, the private economy is facing difficulties, some private enterprises are facing difficulties, entrepreneurs show a lot of anxiety.
In this context, correcting the perception errors, removing the entrepreneur's thought burden, allowing the enterprise to seek to develop, the government to seek to promote development, concerns the market confidence and development expectations, has a profound reality meaning.
The meeting again emphasized the important argument of "three unchanged": "The status and role of the non-public economy in our economic and social development has not changed!"
From the deeper advancement of the simplification of the power, the establishment of the power list system to the creation of a law-government environment that protects the legitimate rights and interests of entrepreneurs, the creation of a fair competitive market environment, the shaping of an atmosphere of respect for entrepreneurs throughout the society, in recent years, the degree of attention of the party center to entrepreneurs and the institutional security efforts are unprecedented.
The meeting further clearly proposed strongly supporting six policy initiatives in the development of private enterprises and launching a series of pragmatic actions dedicated to private enterprises “lightly clothing forward”.
These are greatly encouraging for entrepreneurial groups and more expectations for the whole community.
The bull is dissolved, the policy is set, the key is to implement.
To constantly create a better development environment for the private economy, to help private enterprises solve the difficulties in development, to contribute to the achievement of China's economic transformation upgrade; to make entrepreneurs feel fair in market competition, feel safe in legal operations, feel respect in social life, to stimulate innovation and create potential.
China's economy enters a process towards high-quality development, requires more entrepreneurs to implement ambitions, and also provides more space and stage for entrepreneurs to play creativity.

South Korean chicken soup exports to China increased twenty times in four years or more related to empty nuts youth.
China’s chicken soup exports to China have increased twenty times over the past four years: analysis related to the increase in young people in the empty nests
South Korea’s chicken soup exports to China last year exceeded $100,000, compared to four years ago in 2013, a sharp increase of approximately 20 times.
The analysis suggests that this increase is associated with the increase in China’s empty Nest youth to facilitate food hot sales, and the increase in youth’s attention to nutritional foods.
The data was published by the South Korean Agricultural Aquaculture Food Circulation Commission (aT) on Friday.
Last year, South Korea's chicken juice exports to China amounted to $10.0339 million, weighing 2.18,59 million kg, a sharp increase of 2094% and 3668.8% respectively compared to 2013.
Analysis suggests that the increase in South Korean chicken soup sales in China is related to the increase in empty nuts of youth to facilitate food hot sales, and the increase in youth’s attention to nutritional food.
As of this year, China’s single-home families have broken over 200 million, expected to increase to 30% of the total population in 2020, and local food companies are also targeting “single-food” to launch various convenient foods.
Additionally, the analysis also suggests that bird flu is the biggest factor that prevents the chicken tomato roots in the continental China market.
According to aT, from November 2016 to April last year, a bird flu epidemic occurred in South Korea, and the relevant departments completely banned the export of chicken soup to China, resulting in a dramatic decline in exports.
In 2016, chicken soup exports to China amounted to $840,000, and exports fell to $100,000 last year due to bird flu.

China's border river gate ceremony celebrates National Day
“I can’t imagine that there is such a magnificent flagship ceremony at the border, which is even more shocking than watching the flagship in the land.”
On the 1st morning, Mr. Zhang, who arrived from Sichuan to the border with China's Yunnan River Gate, and more than 500 troops officers, residents and Chinese and foreign tourists jointly watched the national door lifting ceremony, celebrating the 69th anniversary of the establishment of the People's Republic of China.
River Gate is the largest port on the Yunnan section on the border with China and Vietnam, located in the Yunnan province of the Red River State River Gate County, in front of the old city of Vietnam, belonging to the country's type of port.
With the continued deepening of the country’s “Belt and Road” construction, as one of China’s most convenient trails to connect Southeast Asia, the entrance and exit traffic on the river gate has grown steadily.
At 7:30 p.m. that day, the sunlight just revealed a corner, and the limits of the port of the river early gathered the local people of the river and tourists from China and foreign countries who came to watch the flagship ceremony.
At 7:45 a.m., the flagship ceremony began in time, the national gate ceremony team members of the River Gate Border Inspection Station trembled, taking a refined step to accompany the national flagship to the flagship station.
After the commander reached the flagship instructions, the flagship struggles to roll their arms out a line of arc, bright five-star red flags like "The Eagle's Wing" generally open the flagship, accompanied by the nation's glorious and magnificent melody slowly rising.
“In every New Year, Spring Festival, National Day, and other significant time node, the National Day flagship ceremony is held, not only showing the image of China, but also stimulating the patriotism of the people of the various ethnic borders.”
The officers who participated in the flagship ceremony said.
The National Gate Ceremony, which is responsible for the flagship ceremony, consists of more than 40 officers from the various positions of the River Gate Border Inspection Station, from the flagship group of three people to the scale of the ceremony team, which has spent more than 60 years of history, and since its formation has performed more than 70 national-level foreign activity ceremony missions.

The relevant chief of the Ministry of Finance and the National Tax General Bureau said on Thursday that in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in the implementation of the new individual income tax law, will be considered to continue to make preferential arrangements for foreigners including Hong Kong Macao.

During the 73rd UN General Assembly, the parties released some positive information about the issue of the Korean Peninsula.
South Korean President Moon Yong reiterated North Korea’s “unreversible” decision to give up nuclear weapons and said U.S. President Trump and North Korean top leader Kim Jong-un may meet by the end of this year.
The U.S. State Department later said that Secretary of State Pompeo will visit North Korea in October to promote the implementation of the promises of the U.S. leadership meeting in Singapore.
From the beginning of this year to the present day, South Korea has broken the strong ice and opened the path to dialogue, the leaders of South Korea and North America have held meetings, the great trend of relief of the situation on the Peninsula has continued, and the principle of dialogue to solve the problem on the Peninsula has also been adhered.
First, “the essence of the peninsula issue is the security issue” this point has not changed, achieving peace on the peninsula, the key is to correctly and balancedly solve the reasonable security concerns of all sides, rather than one side pressure on the other, one side emphasizing their own demands.
Second, in the dialogue of achieving the denuclearization of the Peninsula, the parties concerned disagreed on the steps and ways of achieving the denuclearization of the Peninsula, due to the long-term lack of political trust between the North and the United States, the game thought of “who first who after” remains strong.
On the UN Security Council's Open Summit on the Korean Peninsula, which took place in New York, the different voices of the parties around the issue of sanctions against the Korean Peninsula reaffirmed that the two points on the issue of the Peninsula were "no changed".
U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo insisted that the sanctions against North Korea will not be repealed until the Korean Peninsula is completely denuclearized.
The Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov emphasized the principle of "to respond with action", noting that "the weakening trend of sanctions should be synchronized with the pace of North Korea gradually leaving its nuclear path."
There is no doubt that the parties concerned should continue to implement the resolution of the Security Council in a comprehensive, complete and accurate manner, but the pressure is not the purpose, the implementation of sanctions and the promotion of political settlement are the requirements of the resolution of the Security Council, both of which cannot be removed and not only one.
As the Chinese Foreign Minister and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, taking into account the current positive progress in the Korean-Corean-American relations, China believes that the Security Council will need to consider in time the reversible provisions to be launched, thus encouraging North Korea and the relevant parties to take greater steps towards nuclear disarmament.
Looking back to the past, every progress in the process of denuclearization and peace of the Peninsula requires the parties to show enough political courage.
Currently, faced with the increasing expectations of the international community to promote political solution to the problem of the Peninsula, the stakeholders should demonstrate political strength, make political decisions, implement commitments, resolve difficulties, continue to take the opposite pace, parallelly advance the process of denuclearization of the Peninsula and establish a peace mechanism of the Peninsula, and jointly create the permanent peace of the Peninsula.

The short-looking quarterly survey published by the Central Bank of Japan on Monday showed that the confidence of Japan’s large manufacturers in the same quarter reached the lowest level in over a year, due to the rise in raw materials costs and a series of natural disasters affecting production, causing to feel pressure.
This survey has hardly shown that increasing global trade friction has hit the confidence of large manufacturers.
But the risk of a comprehensive trade war breaks down the business prospects of the company and may threaten the company’s capital spending.
Active capital spending is a brilliant point in the Japanese economy.
The survey questioned the view of the Central Bank of Japan about a stable economic expansion that would help push the inflation rate to the target of 2%, despite the signs that companies are gradually transferring costs to customers.
“When a global trade war causes concerns, the confidence of manufacturers tends to stagnate due to the slowing of exports and the weak factory production,” said Nanjing, chief researcher at the Agricultural Forest China Gold Comprehensive Institute.
“Confidence remains high, and as corporate profits are improving and prices rise, I don’t think that confidence will continue to fall.”
The short-looking survey showed that the September big manufacturing climate assessment index dropped from the right 21 to the right 19 three months ago, worsening for the third consecutive season.
The average market estimate is 22.
The big non-productive climate assessment index in September dropped from the June survey’s 24 to the 22 for the first time in eight quarters.
The Reuters report is 22.
The survey shows that the big manufacturing and non-producing climate assessment index in December is expected to remain stable.
Investors don’t care about the short-looking corporate economic assessment index decline, the N225 index on Monday rose to the 27th high point, because the continued devaluation of the YPG helped improve the export profit prospects of Japanese companies.
Capital expenditure is stable.
Despite the decline in corporate confidence, the latest shortcomings highlight that corporate capital spending plans are stable, due to renewal of production capacity and increased investment in robotics and automation to respond to the lack of labour caused by population aging.
The central bank’s brief survey showed that large enterprises plan to increase their capital spending by 13.4 percent by the end of March 2019.
The previous short-view survey was 13.6%.
Nanjing said that all corporate capital expenditure planned to grow by 8.5 percent this financial year, close to the pace of the Japanese bubble economy.
He said, “Given that small enterprises have increased profits from now on, capital spending still has a space for further growth, but this depends largely on the impact of trade wars on corporate confidence.”
The short-view survey shows that the ability of enterprises to transfer costs is increased, and the price index for large enterprises is just seven, which is the highest point in the last decade, which is an inspiring sign that Japan’s efforts to counter-conflict have made progress.
The index of measuring the employment situation of large enterprises touched negative 23 and was the most tight level since 1992, highlighting the tension of the employment market.
Benefit from strong corporate spending, the Japanese economy has rebounded in the second quarter since the decline of 1-3 this year.
But the upgrade of summer trade friction and the supply chain is interfered by natural disasters, shrinking the output-dependent Japanese economic prospects.

Reuters Beijing, November 5 - A press release released on Sunday by the China Foreign Trade Center said that the meeting shows that China’s foreign trade situation remains complex and severe, with 80.6% of expecting that the exports throughout the year 2018 will be better than last year or stable.
But given the continued increase in the costs of domestic raw materials, labour and other components, the external environment that increased the impact of China-American trade friction, the participating enterprises believe that the export situation in the next year should not be optimistic.
At the closing press conference of the 124th General Assembly, the Vice-Secretary-General of the General Assembly, the press spokesman and the Vice-Director of the China Foreign Trade Center, Xi Jinping, said that the number of buyers outside the General Assembly arrived and the export transactions were reduced.
This buyers arrived 189,812 people, from 215 countries and regions, with a decrease of 1.11%.
Export transactions were 2,064.94 billion yuan (298.6 billion yuan), compared to a decrease of 1%.
From the market point of view, Japan, ASEAN Ten Countries, BRICS Four Countries, and South Korea trade increased by 74.4%, 11.4%, 7.2%, and 2.5%, and traditional markets such as the United States, Australia, Canada and the European Union fell by 30.3%, 8.9%, 7.3%, and 0.8%, respectively.
From the point of view of the industry, transportation tools, mechanical equipment, building and decorative materials, electronic consumer goods and information products, bathroom equipment increased by 24.8%, 21.1%, 20.0%, 15.1%, and 7.6%, textile clothing, household equipment declined by 13.0%, and 6.7%, respectively.
Xi Jinping said, as a clear rain table and wind orientation of China’s foreign trade, this meeting’s buyers’ attitude and export transaction data show that China’s foreign trade development next year still faces many uncertainty and instability factors.
But with the deeper advancement of the structural reform on the supply side, as well as the recent state and local policy measures on the “six-stable” side, the new dynamics of China’s foreign trade development are accelerating the accumulation, the diversification of the enterprise market continues to make new progress, which are the important basis and strong conditions for the development of foreign trade.
“Comprehensive factors, China’s foreign trade imports and exports are expected to continue to grow smoothly throughout the year, and the quality and efficiency will improve further,” Xi said.
China's Customs Agency announced that exports in September increased by 14.5%, imports in September increased by 14.3%, trade surplus in September was $316,9 billion, and export growth in September and trade surplus were the highest since February this year.
Despite China-American trade friction continuously upgrading, China’s export performance in September remains significantly exceeding expectations, foreign demand is strong, enterprises in the U.S. before imposing tariffs raise exports over the yuan exchange rate devaluation, or the main support factor, also showed China’s foreign trade resilience to a certain extent, but China-American trade war on the hit of confidence, the impact on the industrial chain cannot be small, analysts believe the challenge of China’s foreign trade may appear in the fourth quarter or next year.
The Reuters survey shows that the U.S. fund managers in September suggested to increase the holding of cash and continue to be cautious as the U.S. and China began the latest round of mutual import tariffs and there were no signs of relief in the dispute.
However, 12 fund managers who participated in the survey suggested that North American asset deposits were increased to the highest since June 2017, while UK, the euro area, especially emerging markets, had a decrease in deposits.
Global stock deposits accounted for an average of 56.6% and bonds accounted for 35.5%, basically in accordance with the survey last month.
The most noticeable change is that the cash share increased to 5.1%, the highest since December 2014.
A big fund company’s fund manager said, “Some economic data brings trust to the market, but the trade war remains the biggest concern, so it’s best to be prepared to enter when the market falls back.”
But fund managers still prefer shares in September, especially U.S. shares, even if U.S. shares are considered high prices.
Today, in China’s open landmark Shanghai, the world’s first large national exhibition on import as a theme – China International Import Exhibition, has officially opened its end in all expectations.
An exhibition is like a “window” that makes the world better aware of a city and a country.
Through the “window” of the Exhibition, people see the way towards a higher level of “open China”; through the “window” of the Exhibition, the world welcomes the mutual benefit of China and the “reform and opening again.”
“For a country, openness is like breaking into a butterfly, although it will experience a momentum of pain, but it will be replaced by a newborn.”
General Secretary Xi Jinping’s summary of the Road to the Opening revealed an important reason “Why China Can”.
Looking back on the reform and opening for 40 years, China, who has dared to enter the world market, although has encountered turmoil and waves, but always in an open attitude faces all risks challenges, constantly releases internal dynamics and constantly improves competitiveness.
It can be said that China, with its own true achievements, strongly interpreted the value and meaning of openness.
Standing at a new historical starting point, organizing an exhibition on import as a theme, is a major decision made by the party center, which is at the core of the fellow Xi Jinping, to promote a new round of high-level opening to the outside, is a major initiative of China to open the market to the world, is a real action of China to support economic globalization and trade liberalization, demonstrates the strong and clear will of "China's open doors will not be closed, only will be increasingly opened".
At the same time, the country’s participant registration and the exhibition “a hard request” are the greatest confirmation and best response to China’s open economy in a larger scale, wider field and deeper level.
More importantly, the current global economic and trade order is on a crossroads.
Some countries have built the high walls of trade protectionism, the old path back to unilateralism, increased the concerns of the international community about the prospects of free trade, and added a lot of uncertainty to the warming global economy.
In the context of this era, this event on the Gulf River shore, reflects China’s defense of free trade, enables the world to see the open market, share the future of China’s self-confidence and China’s responsibility.
Go away, and go away.
China opened its hearts and embraced the world, not only strongly promoted its own development, but also brought the world’s nations and regions a huge “China opportunity”.
In recent years, China has advocated and promoted the co-building of the “Belt and Road”, the launch of the sub-investment, the establishment of the Silk Road Fund ... China has provided a range of international public products, providing real export markets, development opportunities and jobs, allowing all countries to travel to China to develop the “Fast Car” “Transport Car”.
It is also such a public product, a large platform for global economic and trade cooperation.
Over this platform, more than 3,000 companies in more than 130 countries and regions, with high quality products and services with all the characteristics brightly appear, take a new step in the Chinese market.
In addition to the companies in all countries, the real benefits are also domestic consumers.
By building this “optional optimization” platform, it provides quality supply of multiple channels for consumption upgrades to meet the personalized, diversified and differentiated consumer needs of the people.
As China’s open doors are increasingly opened, the goods are flowing, the things are used, and the steps towards a better life will be stronger.
From a more macro perspective, the meaning of the Expo has gone beyond the scope of economic and trade, but is looking at the future, communicating the concepts of open, inclusive, generic, balanced, joint-winning, and forming a consensus of joint response to today’s challenges.
The world is good, China is good; China is good, the world is better.
We are hoping that the Expo will bring the world greatness and fulfillment; we are more hoping to move towards a higher level of “open China” with the world together to build the brilliant future of the community of human fate.
The United States has reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The agreement includes Canada’s opening of its dairy markets to the United States, and the United States’ non-temporal tariffs on cars produced in Canada.
According to foreign media, a source from Canada said in the evening of September 30 that the United States and Canada have reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.

More than 90 percent of Brazilian women say the presidential candidates don’t consider women’s needs.
The data published by the Brazilian National Geographic Institute (IBGE) shows that more than 90% of Brazilian women don’t think presidential candidates consider women’s needs.
At present, the number of women in Brazil has reached 1.07 billion, and if all the women in Brazil are gathered together to form a country, the country will be ranked 13th in the world, twice the number of people in Spain.
In Brazil, the number of women voters accounts for 52% of the total number of voters, and the number of men accounts for 48%, while the number of women in voters is very high, but in the Brazilian parliament, the number of women accounts for only 10%.
In 193 countries around the world, Brazil’s women’s participation in politics is only ranked 154th, higher than Arab countries.
After more than 20 years of rights struggle, Brazilian women are still unable to obtain the rights they deserve.
Brazilian sociologist Natalia Mori points out that this phenomenon is caused by the result of the joint work of ancient paternal society, racialism and capitalist values.
“Politics should be made up of the same society by the democracy of citizenship rights, identity, access to public goods and multi-social groups; but Brazil’s politics belongs to the monopoly of a particular group, and the majority of the population is not represented.”
A previous study conducted by the Brazilian Motorcycle Institute (Locomotiva) also found that 94% of Brazilian women don’t think the politicians produced by the election can represent their rights, 90% of Brazilian women don’t agree with the decisions made by politicians, and 93% of women don’t agree with the current government policy.
“We need to turn the problem of the lack of women’s representation in parliament, and the Brazilian political system is still affected by inequality. so far, there is still severe gender, class and racial discrimination in the Brazilian political field,” said Natalya Mori.
Despite the lack of women’s rights, most Brazilian women still believe in the power of democracy.
The survey shows that 76% of women think they can do something in democratic elections, and 72% of women are interested in politics.
Moreover, 55% of women believe that democracy is the best way for women to suffer less prejudice.

As the growth in Europe, Asia and emerging markets is not mostly encouraging, the United States is becoming the main engine for global economic growth.
On September 23, 2018, a container cargo ship stopped in the port in New Jersey, the United States.
However, as the current growth of the U.S. is due to the time of the financial stimulation of the reduction of taxes, the country’s economy is also closely observed by the outside world.
“As the U.S. is regaining full employment, the decline of the economy is inevitable.”
He said the only question was when it would happen, and in his opinion it might only be not to push back in advance.
Although Barclay is optimistic about the U.S. economic prospects by the end of this year, the bank acknowledges that it is more difficult to predict for a further time.
“In the absence of more sustainable investment growth to boost economic growth potential, the current growth driven by financial policies will be difficult to follow,” Barclay economist says in a study report.
“In the absence of investment growth, the economy’s hard landing risk will rise in 2020,” they said.
A series of corporate surveys will approximately show that major economies are in the economic cycle stage at the end of the third quarter.
The Eurozone and U.S. manufacturing survey, which is scheduled to be published on Monday, will be concerned and the service industry survey will be published on Wednesday.
But the data side will definitely focus on the US non-agricultural employment data that will be published next Friday, which will provide clues about whether the tight employment markets are driving a significant wage growth.
Its importance is important not only for the profitability of the company and for the purchasing power of the consumer, but also for the salary rise or the overall inflation rise, which may cause concerns to U.S. Federal Reserve/FED officials.
“The wages will be very concerned, as it is likely that the round will increase significantly again compared to the previous month.
The increase in September may not be over 3% compared to the same period last year, but we can fully expect that the next month will break down,” the Dutch International Group (ING) economists wrote in a study report.
While vacation in China and other regions of Asia leads to the data surface of the region next week, the European policy may become a source of market volatility.

Despite the continued shock in the global financial markets, the Hong Kong Financial Administration said on Monday that Foreign Exchange Fund’s investment revenues in the third quarter of this year decreased by 97 percent annually but better than the previous quarter, because under the Chinese-American trade war, foreign stock flooded high, foreign exchange losses also significantly narrowed.
According to the latest data, on September 7, 2018, the Foreign Exchange Fund recorded investment revenues of 1.6 billion HRK, significantly lower than 61.8 billion HRK in the same period last year, but better than 100 million HRK in the second quarter of this year.
President Chen De Liu said at the legislative meeting that at the beginning of the Chinese-American trade war, Hong Kong and emerging market shares index opposed to the US shares index, until the end of September and early October, after the U.S. shares index successfully saw the top, the market emotions began to reverse, as investors gradually realized that the trade war was negative to the United States itself.
“A change in market mood is a good thing, and if a trade war has only a unilateral impact, it will not help to solve things much.”
But he also pointed out that “if the Chinese-American trade war fails to be solved, the volatility of the financial markets will continue to rise.”
In the third quarter of this year, the exchange fund’s share investment losses in Hong Kong shrinked 8% to 4.7 billion HRK compared to the previous quarter, the foreign stock investment revenues increased 172% to 12.8 billion HRK; foreign exchange losses 16.2 billion HRK, bond revenues 9.7 billion HRK, decreased 24% and 31% per quarter, mainly reflect the total rise of the dollar in the quarter to the main currency and the U.S. interest rate in the middle of September.
The foreign exchange funds are mainly used to support the Hong Kong dollar.
Hong Kong has implemented a linked exchange rate system linked to the dollar since 1983.
As for Hong Kong’s current financial situation, Chen De Liu said the economic and asset market uncertainty increased, the risk increased, but Hong Kong’s financial system is stable, it is also good for defense, and the earthquake resistance capacity is sufficient.
“Hong Kong’s international investment heads are sufficient, with a net asset value of $1.4 trillion equal to four times GDP, 2.5 times higher than Singapore and 0.6 times higher than Japan, enough to cope with the economic downturn cycle or reversal.”
The recent Hong Kong dollar discharge rate continues to decline and expands with the dollar interest rate, Chen De Liu pointed out that the Hong Kong dollar exchange price on September 21 had risen over 400 basic points, the market is generally believed to be mainly related to the Hong Kong dollar discharge rate rise, after which the Hong Kong dollar to the dollar is rotating at the level near 7.80-7.84, to the recent Hong Kong dollar discharge rate continues to decline, with the dollar interest rate expands, it may attract the market for Hong Kong dollar, buy the dollar's discharge activity to increase, making Hong Kong dollar again trigger the weak side exchange warranty opportunities for a long time.
But he believes that with the beginning of the Hong Kong bank’s interest rate cycle and the normalization of the Hong Kong dollar interest rate, the future of the Hong Kong dollar interest rate below the dollar interest rate will change.
“Hong Kong Dollar interest rates will be more consistent with the U.S. dollar interest rate trend, and people need to be more careful to manage risks, be prepared to cope with market volatility.”
Due to the sufficient funds of the HKD, the HKD discharge rate further declined, the three-month discharge rate weekly declined 0.9% to 2.08179%, with the USD discharge expanded from 46 base points to 51 base points; a month discharge rate became five-month new low, with the USD discharge expanded from 120 base points to 127 base points.
From May to mid-September, the currency exchange rate for most of the time was close to $7.85 to $1.
During this period, due to the completion of the dividend activity and large dividend activity, a part of the dividend income money flows out of the HKD, leading to the weak side exchange guarantee after the first launched in April, in May and August again and again.
In accordance with the contact exchange rate system, the Bank of Hong Kong purchased the Hong Kong dollar at the level of 7.85, and exported the dollar to maintain the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate stable.
In May and August, the Bank purchased approximately 52.1 billion HRK under the weak-party exchange guarantee mechanism.

There is no "barrier" for the monthly center: quality certification promotes quality improvement.
With the “two children’s economy” and the prosperity of the mother-baby market, from the north to the three-four-line cities, a variety of monthly meetings have emerged.
Currently a very burning month will meet the consumer needs of the crowd, the fees range from tens of thousands and even hundreds of thousands, but at the same time is also in a shameful situation, this institution has so far no boundary, regulation still exists empty areas.
The National Market Regulation General Bureau recently conducted the 2018 national "quality month" series of events, and reporters came to a five-star month center in Tianjin to visit the certification experience of mother-baby care services.
The general monthly center provides newborn care, nutritional meals, postpartum plastic repair and other services.
In this month center, the journalists saw that the nurses checked the breastfeeding situation daily, and the professional caregivers provided the newborn bathing, touching and other care services.
At the same time, in order to meet the needs of new mothers, from early menstrual wound care, to late menstrual cosmetic care and other services, they provide medical treatment and beauty care projects, helping mothers recover.
A new mother in the residence told reporters that she had scheduled to attend the month meeting only eight months in advance.
The service project directly affects the comfort of the mother during the month as well as the physical recovery, some small month will only provide some simple monthly services, there are disinfection sanitary irregularities, easy cross-infections, diet single unknown and other problems.
The head of the moon center said they were the only of all five-star moon centers in Tianjin and the only one that received B-level service certification.
“Al some customers don’t understand the meaning of B-level accreditation at first, it’s important for the long-term development of the business to benefit the customer’s strictly standardized process management through accreditation,” he said.
Panliffen, Deputy Director of the Department of Certification and Regulation of the National Market Regulation General Bureau, said that service certification is a new type of certification system based on customer perception, attention to the degree of organizational quality management and service characteristics satisfaction, is an important component of the national quality infrastructure, has a positive role in improving the quality service supply ratio and enhancing China service international competitiveness.

Reuters Hong Kong November 5 - Hong Kong building prices fell two months in a row after seeing the top, Hong Kong Financial Administration chairman Chen De Liu said on Monday that it still takes time to observe whether the building market has entered the downstream cycle, if confirmed, it can be considered in the appropriate time to strengthen the recurring and recurring cycle measures.
Chen said that if the building price reverses, the main impact will be those who are employed at the height of the building market, but the expectation is that the building price falls drastically when the 1997 Asian financial storm occurred, and the citizens have a significant decrease in the price of the property selling is much less likely.
Chen De Liu, who led several senior members of the Gold Management Board, attended the Legislative Assembly’s briefing meeting, said that if the building market is confirmed to enter a downturn cycle, relief measures may be appropriate at the time.
“But now we see only a few weeks of data, relaxing is still early, and it takes more time to see if the building market enters the downstream cycle.”
Since 2009, the Bank has launched eight round reversal cycle measures to significantly strengthen the disclosure of various properties, including reducing the disclosure number, disclosure applicants must pass rigorous pressure tests, and so on, to improve bank risk management and earthquake resistance capacity.
As Hong Kong officially entered the interest rate cycle, the private housing price index in Hong Kong on September 8 saw the top down for two months in a row, and the monthly fall in September expanded further to 1.44%.
But the cumulative increase in the first three seasons of this year remains 10.2%.
According to the data, the financial situation of the households with the capacity to resist the earthquake of Hong Kong facing financial risks is still healthy, in the second quarter of this year, the proportion of homeless residents of Hong Kong families without disclosure reached 66%, higher than the average of 2009-11%; the proportion of new disclosure disclosure disclosure disclosure disclosure disclosure disclosure disclosure disclosure disclosure disclosure disclosure disclosure disclosure disclosure disclosure disclosure disclosure disclosure disclosure disclosure disclosure disclosure disclosure disclosure disclosure disclosure disclosure disclosure disclosure disclosure disclosure disclosure disclosure disclosure disclosure
But Chen said that high earthquake resistance does not mean that employed citizens will not be damaged by the economic decline, because the value of the property will fall, and those who buy the building in the highest period will be the first to push it.
Though the Bank’s Banking Authority has strengthened the loans to the open-source lenders, employers can also obtain high-percent open-source loans by open-source insurance or by developers providing open-source loans.
Chen De Liu said that now, along with the open-source loans offered to developers, the debtors can reach 85-90% of the open-source number, and if the building price falls one percent, there will be negative assets (i.e. the real estate market value falls to a lower level than the unpaid return of the open-source loans total).
However, Deputy Chairman of the Banking Authority, Nguyen Nanjing, pointed out that the authorities estimate that the high percentage of disclosure is provided by developers, representing only 2-2.5 per cent of the total disclosure of banks, and that the percentage is still lower.
At the height of Hong Kong’s negative assets in 2003, the number of negative assets exceeded 100,000, representing 22% of the share of builders.
As of the third quarter of this year, Hong Kong recorded zero-negative assets for seven consecutive seasons.

It is understood that many beneficial factors, including the increase in the country’s outsourcing visa policy to Chinese citizens, have been influenced by the continued increase in passengers who use the holiday holiday to travel for holiday shopping in countries such as Europe and Southeast Asia.
On the 1st morning, Ro Lake, Shenzhen Bay, Royal Gong, Foucault and other ports will come to the peak of the passenger flow, where the peak of the port passenger flow continues from 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m., and the peak of the Shenzhen Bay port passenger flow from 6:30 a.m. to 13:00 a.m.

Systemic red spinal acne is a chronic suspicion that affects the whole body’s polio, which has been previously considered a “untreated” disease.
Due to its mechanism of occurrence is unknown, diagnosis is difficult, lack of effective therapeutic methods cannot be root.
Recently, the researchers of the Chongqing University Institute of Life Sciences, Liu Vani, and the Chongqing State Joint Team, director of the People's Hospital's Wet Immunity Center, discovered that human immune cell proteins have increased the sensitive molecular variations of systematic red spinal acne, and that variation is involved in regulating immune B cells.
In short, the two teams confirmed that an abnormal immune molecule in the human body was a major cause of the systemic red spinal acne.
According to one of the authors of the article, the North Korean People's Hospital Sun Shirin introduced, the Chateau National team collected 2,000 large samples of systematic red spinal acne patients and conducted research, found that patients with immunosupplemental protein variations produced pathogenic cells and a wide range of, a lot of self-antibodies, kidney, arthritis, plasma, blood vessel and other inflammation incidence and severity significantly increased.
Through various research methods, including immune cell detection, animal testing, sequence, the team found that this immune molecular variation activates an immune signal pathway, promoting the B cell secretion of multiple antibodies.
The journalists learned that the two teams were strongly united, fully deployed their advantages, achieved a close combination of basic research and clinical applications.
The Liu Vanli team is committed to immunity identification and immunity activation studies of B lymphatic cells, while the Chateau National team has long been engaged in clinical studies of systematic red spinal acne.
“This study is one of the results of the two teams’ years of cooperation and is the first time the academic community recognizes mechanically that an abnormality in the immunosupplementary protein genes will trigger systematic rosacea, putting a solid foundation for further academic research and clinical targeted treatment.”
This is not a short-term, but according to the law.
Does the lawyer carry the shell to the court?
The news was really exciting at first, and the legal circle exploded.
The Fukushima City Law subsequently sent a fine of 500 yuan to the involved lawyers, and in writing recommended the Fukushima City Lawyers Association to investigate the process.
According to the New York Times, the Sunshine City Law Association issued an official announcement that the behavior of the two lawyers does not involve violations of law and is not punished according to the law.
According to a number of reports, the processing of the Fujian City Law Association is not short or confronted, but has been approved by the Fujian Central House.
Together, the events that could originally cause tensions within the legal community were eventually resolved properly.
The reversal of things, arises from a more comprehensive truth recovery: involving the lawyer carrying the shell with the accused’s murder weapon in the same style, the same model, but not opened, only in proofing the proof line as a assistant proof, there is no threatening action or “threatening the security of the court” subjective intention.
The judgment of whether the behavior of the lawyer is unlawful, there are four very important details to be taken into account: the first, the local court before the two trials, showed only the shell photo, from a defensive point of view, showing the shell material its necessity; the second, the shell was only one hour before the trial to go to purchase, not the lawyer was not willing to seek the consent of the judge, but objectively failed to contact the judge; the third, the whole shell was not overwhelmed or misused; the fourth, the lawyer involved first time openly recognized the mistake and apologized to the court.
Summary of these circumstances, it is possible to see that the involved lawyer "with a shell out of court" is not related to misconduct, only for defence.
After clarification of the whole fact passed, the Fujian City Law Association did not push the water, but under pressure made a decision not to be punished.
This decision can also be tested by facts and law.
As to the fact that without the permission of the court, it will be brought to the court as a cheek of control knives, it is easy to cause anxiety and misunderstanding.
For security and careful considerations, the previous penalties and judicial recommendations of the Qingdao Central Court are also untouchable.
In order to preserve the dignity of lawyers, and to prevent individual courts from suffering for lawyers, the Supreme Court in 2014 issued the "People's Court Judicial Police Safety Inspection Rules", establishing the principle that lawyers go to court do not need to carry out personal safety inspections.
Since the rule has been published, many lawyers have rarely occurred incidents that hurt the security of the court due to security checks.
In very individual cases such as Fujian, it is not difficult to eliminate misunderstandings as long as they communicate on the basis of a spirit of mutual respect and understanding.
The Lawyers’ Association, as an autonomous organization in the lawyer industry, has a double mission to punish the illegal and safeguard the law.
Previously individual law associations due to preference to punishment, lost to guarantee, suffered from illness.
And the decision of the Fujian Law Association, whether from the process or outcome, is worthy of praise, and is an example for more law associations to properly perform their functions.

The Okinawa Governor's election, which took place in advance due to the death of former governor Yong Xi'an's illness, was announced in the morning of the 1st local time, and was successfully elected by Yong City Danny, who opposed the plan for the transfer of the U.S. military base in Japan.
The election was voted on September 30th, and the final results showed that Yuan City received a total of 39.6632 million votes, making Okinawa County Governor's election history the most voted, with more than 80,000 votes than its main campaign opponent Zohim Yuan.
A total of four candidates participated in the election, with a voting rate of 63.24%, a 0.89 percent drop compared to the 2014 Okinawa County Governor's election.
The Yuan City said to the media that the election results show that the people of the province don’t want to let the efforts of Yuan Governor before his life be wasted, he will inherit Yuan Governor's legacy, and will continue to do efforts to the Japanese government and the U.S. government against the U.S. military base transfer plan and the closure of the U.S. base.
The U.S. military base is located in Okinawa, Okinawa, Okinawa, and has long suffered from malaria, and the U.S. government has previously agreed to move it to the border area of Okinawa, but the people of Okinawa strongly oppose, hoping to move the base completely out of Okinawa.
With regard to the people of the district strongly opposed the migration plan and the demand for the withdrawal of the permission to fill marine land on the border coast, Yuan City said he was not at the beginning in a position of opposition and division with the central government, hoping that the two sides can fully exchange opinions, showing the intention to resolve through consultation.

He also expressed his hopes to negotiate with Yogyakarta.
Yuan City will formally become governor of Okinawa County on 4th of this month.
Since the middle of the 2000s, with China’s demand for oil seeds growing, North Dakota farmers Paul Thomas have grown more and more soya in his land.
This shift reached its peak this year, he planted 1,600 hectares of soya in 5,000 hectares of land, reaching an unprecedented scale.
But Thomas and many farmers like him plan to transplant the previous main food crops in the U.S. Agricultural Area in 2019: corn and grain.
The US farmers cultivated soya more than corn this year, for the first time in 35 years.
The reason for the plan to transplant other food crops is because in the context of the U.S. President Trump's trade war against China, U.S. farmers have trouble selling soya.
China usually purchases about 60% of US exports of soya, but due to trade wars, almost zero purchases of US soya in recent months led to soya prices falling to the decade low.
Thomas plans to grow more grain next year, hoping to earn more by reducing the dependence on crops that depend on China's demand.
Thomas said the price of soya "take us a painful blow."
He said that without China’s purchase demand, soya near its farm is priced at $7.10 per pound ear, while the cost required to cover is $8.50.
U.S. farmers have reached a record high soya cultivation area this year, and the harvest is also expected to reach a record high.
Just in such a moment that was easily impacted, they met with a hit of a trade war.
Trump imposed tariffs on imports of Chinese goods, and China imposed tariffs on imports of US soya in July.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture will publish the first forecast report on the cultivation area next year, which will include consideration of the tariff effects.
The forecast is expected to confirm the public agencies expected to reduce the area of soya plantation.
According to a Reuters report, Information Economics on October 19 predicts that the corn cultivation area will increase by 4% to 9.2 million hectares (3.7 million hectares) in 2019, and soya cultivation area will decrease by 7% to 8.3 million hectares.
Informa also anticipates a 4% increase in the U.S. grain cultivation area.
Soya area grown before the implementation of rewarding tariffs increased to 8.9 million hectares this year, more than 1.5 million hectares 10 years ago.
The corn cultivation area has increased to less than 5 million hectares since 2008, to 8.9 million hectares, this year the grain cultivation area is 4.7 million hectares, close to the lowest level in 100 years.
Aron Carlson, Chairman of the Illinois Corn Growth Association, has a total cultivation area of 3,600 hectares, and this year he will spend almost half on soya, but plans to be cut in the future.
He said it could increase the corn cultivation area by up to 20 percent in his farms in northern Illinois; the state is the largest soya cultivation state in the United States.
Soya per hectare is less produced than corn, but fewer fertilizer is needed, which makes soya generally less expensive.

Xinhua International Time Review: Defense of multilateralism, China knows the unity.
At the moment of the unilateralism reversal flows, international rules and multilateral order are affected.
To a certain extent, the confrontation between unilateralism and multilateralism has entered a critical period.
As a responsible power, China, with the concepts and strong actions of all-in-right, jointly and strongly, jointly preserves multilateralism with the international community and promotes the continued advancement of multilateralism.
Faced with the new challenges of the new situation, China has issued a loud voice on the direction and path of multilateral development.
As Minister of State and Foreign Affairs Wang Yi said in his General Debate Speech at the 73rd UN General Assembly, the new era of multilateralism should rely on cooperation and win as a goal, on the basis of rule and rule, on equal justice as a goal, and on effective action as a goal.
At the same time, China calls on the construction of a global development cooperation pattern supplementing the United Nations as the core, South and North cooperation as the main channel and South and South cooperation, and calls on all parties to cooperate in building a community of human fate.
China’s thought and voice reflect the mainstream voice of the international community.
As the 73rd UN Chairman, Espinosa said, in the current situation, “the United Nations needs more than ever to promote multilateralism and maintain a rule-based international system.”
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) chairman Lagarde said the international community should continue to firmly maintain the multilateral trade system, adhere to the rules of international trade and resolve disputes through consultation.
In recent years, accompanied by the adjustment of global economic and political strength comparisons, some emerging markets and groups of developing countries have risen, playing a greater role in the major international multilateral mechanisms, providing a new development drive for reversal multilateralism.
Standing in this dimension of consideration, China advocates the construction of a family rather than gathering a small circle, persisting on communal trade and co-building rather than engaging the winners, and the multilateral concept, according to the trend of the time, is the inevitable choice of addressing global challenges, solving world difficulties, representing the common demand of most countries in the world.
There are advanced concepts and more solid actions.
China’s “Belt and Road” initiative has become the largest platform for international cooperation.
China launched joint-building “Belt and Road”, Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and “16+1 Cooperation” international and regional cooperation initiatives, to promote international regional cooperation, to improve the complement of existing international systems and order, to bring innovation and vitality to multilateral cooperation, and to contribute to the development of international order in a more fair and reasonable direction.
As a defender of international order and a practitioner of multilateralism, China’s actions on this multilateral UN stage are increasingly powerful.
Around the international hotspots, addressing climate change, participating in peace operations, sharply reducing poverty and helping other countries implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
As UN Secretary-General Guterres said, China has become an important pilar of multilateralism.
As the world faces the “deficit of trust” increases, and as populism and polarization trends rise, this is the most urgent moment in the world’s demand for multilateral cooperation.
In such a historical end, the international community needs to join together, make consensus action, strongly defend multilateralism, and jointly promote the construction of a community of human fate.

The fifth “Disabled Voice Month” comes to focus on disabled youth sexual education issues – China New Network
In recent years, Chinese youth sexual education has been widely discussed, but the challenge for disabled youth sexual education remains tough.
In recent days, a comprehensive educational challenges and practical strategy seminar for disabled people was held in Beijing.
How to conduct sexual education for disabled children and youth has become an important topic of this seminar.
The China Disabled Children’s Sexual Knowledge, Attitude and Behavior Report, published on the conference, shows that disabled children suffer from sexual harassment and sexual abuse more than healthy children.
For disabled children and adolescents, more attention is given in society as well as "sex protection".
The seminar aims to explore the three aspects of family support, school education, and institutional services to promote comprehensive education for children with disabilities and teenagers in China, to support children with disabilities and teenagers from the source, to allow them, like others, to have the right to enjoy love.
Experts believe that the Chinese society’s awareness of disabled groups has always remained on a low level.
Under the influence of factors such as traditional concepts, China has not yet deep enough comprehensive education for persons with disabilities, especially children with disabilities and adolescents.
But in recent years, with the support of the United Nations UNESCO and people of public interest, Chinese disabled people have had a pleasant development of sexual and reproductive health education practices and the path to achievement throughout the cycle.
The report shows that vision disorders, hearing disorders, intellectual disorders and body disorders children and youth in access to sexual knowledge and understanding of intimate relationships will be a bit more difficult than the general people, but in general they have developed towards ease and enrichment.

This year’s evening, on the K158 train, in Zhengzhou, Joe’s third-party colleague travelled to the Cave Wall.
A grandmother on the train bought a ticket without seat, but took her seat: “Take a picture and take a picture.”
After two hours of driving, the train manager advised him that an hour was still ineffective.
In the end, a man with the car passenger couldn’t see down and pulled the boss up.
From the opinion of the public, although the ultimate result is mostly that the hegemonians are condemned by the public, administered by the public security department, and even included in the black list of integrity, the public still feels not "deceiving" : why not let the hegemonians be punished?
Why is it not possible to stop their unmoral and even unlawful acts, but later to punish them?
And for the unrighteous behavior of the "Hegison Grand" how can only a male passenger "see complaint" pull it up?
The main reason for this is that only long-range trains are equipped with police, short-range trains are not available; even if there is police, the police are more concerned about the possible unwilling reaction of the hegemonians without taking compulsory removal measures.
The repeated hegemony events make people realize that the hegemony must be forced to be removed or punished in order to play a repressive role.
This requires that our police trains dare to take strong measures in time, and that no police trains should be set up as soon as possible in order to preserve the timely stop and combat the violations.

Activate rural consumption, cleanse the market by normalizing mechanisms, guide the healthy consumption demand, and increase the sense of access to agricultural consumption.
The data show that the consumer potential of rural residents continues to be released, with the retail sales of rural consumer goods increasing 10.5% in the first half of this year, increasing by 1.3 percentage points above cities.
In one district in the west, a poor village visited, the whole village only had a facility store, went into the store, some goods seemed to have known, “Golden Dragon Fish” marked as “Golden Dragon Oil”, “Wangji” became “Wang Milk”, “Sangji” goods many.
In these years, similar phenomena have been frequently exposed, some rural counterfeit goods are famous, names are close, packaging similar, fake true, undeniable.
A consumption survey published in a western city showed that the problems of superfake goods are serious, with 66% of users buying fake goods in the sub-city supermarkets, with more than half of food.
The relevant department is regulating the rural market, yearly screaming, why is “Lee Ghost” still uninterrupted?
Unlike the urban markets, the farmer's defence consciousness is relatively poor, plus many rural locations are distant, are in a blind area that does not have sufficient regulatory power, allowing false goods to grow soil.
A commodity multi-head pipes, some department pipes prices, some pipes production, some pipes markets, function crossings, yearly falsification, concentrated governance of a wind, false goods escape the wind, and slowly come out, just finished old vacation, new vacation comes out.
The lack of long-term regulatory mechanisms, the rural markets are difficult to clean up, the illegal costs are low, the profits are large, and some illegal traders are triggered by the "up to the mountains and down to the countryside" and some rural areas are becoming the "destruction market".
From warm to well-being, many farmers are moving towards developmental consumption.
On Monday, the Central Party and the Council of Ministers issued a number of opinions on the improvement of the mechanism to promote the consumption system to further stimulate the consumer potential of the residents, which proposed to promote the upgrade of the consumption scale of the rural residents, with the aim of allowing the vast majority of farmers to "consume" "will consume" "will consume" and allowing rural consumption to really grow.
On the one hand, it is necessary to deepen the reform, to eliminate the market regulation of the government with multiple and multiple management defects, to improve food safety, product quality monitoring network, and to constantly compress rural falsification and sales falsification spaces.
On the other hand, to increase the force of law enforcement, to regulate the “male blood vessels”, never allow false fraud to spread in rural areas.
Strong punishment of the mining farmers is to protect the farmers, no matter how hidden the falsificers are, they should not be the reason for the production of the falsific goods, the relevant departments should clarify their responsibilities, the basic level of regulatory power falls down, which line out of the problem, they should investigate responsibility, let the falsificers, the falsificers, the falsificers, be hidden anywhere.
Strictly put the access to the market, implement strict qualification review on the manufacturer operators, put the market circulation, let the products come right, go to the road, from the source and roots to think of the way, let the legitimate distributors operate safely, let the farmers buy safely.
Activate rural consumption and guide healthy consumption demand.
In conjunction with the upgrade of consumption, many farmers are not only pursuing to eat and eat well, but also pursuing a high quality of culture, health and other life, and cannot take the rural markets with "low quality" and " cheap" paintings.
This needs to promote the extension of e-commerce coverage to the wide range of rural areas, to streamline the urban and rural two-way connected sales channels, to promote the integration of the underline industrial development platform and the online e-commerce trading platform, to support the expansion of the new model of consumer industry to the rural market; to promote the conditioned rural areas to organically combine commercial and commercial logistics with recreational agriculture, rural tourism, product processing, and so on; to improve the modern rural circulation network system, to optimize the integration of stock facility resources, to effectively reduce the costs of rural circulation.
Create a clean and quiet market environment for the countryside, let the farmers consume not worry, the rural consumption can become more and more expensive, and can increase the sense of access and happiness of the farmers consume.

If the interest rate really rises, this will be the fifth time the central bank has increased its interest rate in less than a year.
Analysts visiting Reuters previously predicted a 0.1% growth.
The Bureau of Statistics of Canada said on Friday that 12 of the 20 industries achieved growth.

Chairman of the Central Bank of Canada, Poloz, on Thursday promised that the central bank will continue to gradually raise interest rates and will closely follow economic data.
The next publication of the interest rate decision will be on October 24.
As Canada’s economy is rising and unemployment is close to its record low, the Central Bank of Canada has increased its interest rates four times since July 2017.
Senior Canadian economist Stephen Brown said that the country’s economic third-quarter GDP is expected to grow by about 2 per cent over the annual rate.
“This will be 1.5 percent higher than Canada’s central bank expected, and therefore it will be another reason Canada’s central bank is expected to raise interest rates next month,” he said in a report.

South Korea for the first time in 65 years jointly visits Hangzhou into the shore.
The South Korean Ministry of Defense confirmed that the South Korean government launched a joint inspection on the Hangzhou and Xinjiang entrance waters on the same day.
The initiative is a preliminary preparation to ensure the free navigation of civilian ships of the two sides.
The South Korean Defence Ministry announced that this is the first time since the signing of the North Korean War cessation agreement in 1953, the two sides conducted a joint inspection of the Hangzhou Gate.
South Korea signed a military agreement in September this year and agreed to jointly explore waters like Hangzhou's entrance to the coast in November to ensure that the waters will be protected by the environment and develop tourism and so on.

On November 5th, the South Korean co-water inspection was officially launched.
The joint inspection group consists of 20 Korean military and experts.
According to the South Korean Ministry of Defense, during the examination, both persons were not carrying weapons, and the use of stimulus behaviors was prohibited.
“Because there is no military separation line near the entrance gate, the area has been an unfortunately high-developed area, but through joint inspections, the future here will become a new peace area.”
This time South Korea jointly explored the waters, total length of about 70 km, total area of about 280 square kilometers.
The South Korean Ministry of Defense announced that it will send six inspection vessels to explore the depth of sea waters and provide basic information for the safe navigation of the waters; after the investigation is completed, it will provide navigation maps for civil vessels.
The South Korean government had held a summit in Pyongyang in October 2007 to reach an agreement on joint use of Hangzhou and Xinjiang in the shore, but the subsequent negotiations were delayed due to the tension of the peninsula.
