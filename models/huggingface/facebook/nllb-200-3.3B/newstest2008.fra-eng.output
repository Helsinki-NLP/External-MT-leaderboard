Inflation in Europe has slipped to food.
The accelerated inflation, as measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
In November, the rise in prices in the 13 euro area countries was larger than expected, after an inflation rate of 2.6 per cent in October, an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent was recorded, the statistical office of the European Community in Luxembourg said.
Official forecasts showed only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the US, UK and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not lower the key interest rate, saying that the decrease in interest rates, with the growth of commodity prices and the decrease in the unemployment rate, would lead to the generation of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below but close to 2%.
One analyst says that this is the Catch 22 for the ECB: "we need to dissuade" inflation so that we do not have to intervene on this subject later.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3 per cent is the highest in the last 12 years and in Spain it has risen from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area has soared due to the rapid rise in food and energy prices.
The cereal futures market shares rose by 88 per cent and the price of soybeans also reached its highest value since 1973.
The price of cooking oil and dairy products also increased considerably in 2007.
This year, the world price of oil has risen by 52 percent, and last month a barrel of black gold was worth almost 100 dollars.
According to the ECB, the inflation rate will rise from 2.1% in 2008 to 2.5% this year, but will fall to 1.9% in 2009.
Analysts say the 12-month inflation rate remains around 3 percent, however, the next 3 to 4 months, the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to cut the key rate twice in 2008.
Gallup says there's a government crisis.
After a long period of stagnation, the number of supporters of Fidesz (Alliance of Young Democrats) increased significantly at the beginning of December, and now it has the largest number of supporters since 2002, while Gallup (the polling institute) has never before recorded such low socialist support, namely 13 percent.
For loyal voters, the difference would represent, due to the greater determination of the opposition voters, a support of more than two thirds (71 per cent) against a support of a fifth (20 per cent) for the MSZP (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to the poll, the MDF (Forum of Hungarian Democrats) and the SZDSZ (Alliance of Free Democrats) are below the parliamentary threshold: their support is two percent in the entire population.
Of the loyal voters who did go to the polls, the number of supporters of both parties increased by 1 percent.
The economic climate continued to deteriorate from the previous lowest point, the proportion of those who considered that the economic situation of the country was particularly serious was never higher, it stands at 41 percent and according to 46 percent additional the situation is quite serious.
After the more optimistic outlook of last spring and summer, families are again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expects a worsening of the situation and only one tenth expects an improvement.
Last December, 71 percent of those polled, a majority unseen in previous Gallup polls, said the prime minister was doing his job poorly rather than well.
13 percent of the respondents have confidence or a lot of confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 percent do not trust the Prime Minister at all and 27 percent the Fidesz president.
One indicator of the change in the political situation is the proportion of the public who believe that the dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be dealt with without a change of government.
While after the October riots, 35 per cent of those polled wanted the government and the Prime Minister to remain in office, at present this figure is only 20 per cent.
When asked about the intention to vote, 60% of respondents said they would certainly vote and an additional 20% said they would probably vote.
For comparison, for a "legislative election to be held next Sunday", only 55 per cent of those polled would certainly participate and 15 per cent more would probably participate.
74 percent of people would say no to tuition fees for higher education, 79 percent would say no to consultation fees and 84 percent would say no to hospital fees.
If we look at the same proportions among those who expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of voters respectively would reject the introduction of registration fees, consultation fees and hospital fees.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices by almost twenty percent
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs shopping triangle have maintained the average price increase of 16 per cent last year, with the difference that this year the VAT rate has not increased.
Article by Napi Gazdaság (Daily Economy)
This year, in the Budaörs shopping triangle, the usual daily Christmas basket also increased by an average of 16 percent, with an increase of well over one thousand forints in all hypermarkets.
Prices, which had already risen in large food stores last December, have not increased sharply from the previous high base.
Nevertheless, consumers are obviously shocked to see that items purchased for well under nine thousand forints last year now cost more than ten thousand forints.
The daily basket in the surveyed hypermarkets exceeded the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints by 91 forints.
And the highest value of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, this amount was HUF 6800.)
Prices for Unicum and live fish remained at almost the same level as last year, but prices for turkey fillets, nuts and peacock have risen sharply.
In shops, the price of flour and bread followed the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics) data, but at Auchan, bread was found for only 139 forints per kilo.
Competition did not bring the price of the product below HUF 200.
It was surprising to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the bottle of two liters of Coca-Cola was under 200 forints, so it cost only 257 forints the bottle included.
However, this year, in terms of the Daily Basket, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora the least expensive.
According to our calculations, Cora has increased the price of her daily basket by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan have increased them by about 18 and 18 percent respectively.
Comparing last year's most expensive basket to this year's least expensive basket, we see a 12 percent gap whereas the difference between last year's cheapest basket and this year's most expensive basket is 21 percent.
Prices increased by an average of HUF 1,480 per person.
Last year prices increased by an average of HUF 1 206, although the impact of the VAT rate increase was already felt in last year's Christmas prices.
This process has left the trade perplexed, as hypermarkets were unable to clearly determine what margin to apply to products as they were unable to predict the impact of price changes on consumption.
(If a trader miscalculates the turnover of a product, he may lose a large profit on the margin adjusted to the intensity of trade.)
Because of the change in the VAT rate, the increase in the prices of the daily basket has changed so excessively that the most expensive basket was 1 720 HUF higher than the value of the one in 2006, while the difference between the cheapest baskets was only 844 HUF.
This year the difference was not so great, as the most expensive basket was worth HUF 1 630 more than last year and the cheapest basket was worth HUF 1 284 more.
Bringing the two seasons of Christmas closer together, we have seen a catastrophic increase in prices, in less than 20 months the prices of everyday consumer goods have increased by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm the KSH data: for some basic foodstuffs, the statistical institute has found a price increase of more than 30 per cent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, with flour and eggs.)
According to the Daily Basket of the latter, this seems almost absurd since the price level of this product, already very expensive last year, has increased by just over 10 percent compared to the base.
The indices show that flour suppliers are in a stronger position than egg suppliers because they have managed to get the multinationals to accept the sharp price increases.
In the commercial golden triangle, the hypermarkets do not complain, they consistently record good years.
In our experience, most customers no longer look at prices in the three hypermarkets we visited.
They buy everything in bulk, they take long-stored food in pallets.
Large queues formed at the checkout desks of the three hypermarkets on Wednesday morning as the number of customers increased sharply.
However, according to our information, turnover is less important in the provinces, many multinational companies complain to the survey companies that they do not even reach the expected turnover, not only for food but also for consumer durable goods.
Many hospitals are cutting back on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, caused mainly by the misuse of antibiotics, have been recorded in hospitals.
Hygienic conditions in hospitals, insufficient beds, and overworked medical staff do not help to stop infections, says the chief medical officer of the National Epidemiology Center.
Many hospitals are also cutting back on disinfectants
Not long ago an MRSA infection was diagnosed in the trauma department of the János Hospital.
The antibiotic-resistant bacteria was detected in a man who was hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
Earlier this year, a similar infection occurred in the same area.
The man who was injured in a serious car accident was released from the hospital but shortly afterwards he had to be returned due to an MRSA infection and since then the doctors have been unable to perform a major operation because of the bacteria in his system.
Until 10 December this year, 1,094 hospital infections caused by a multi-resistant pathogen were reported to the National Hospital Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröcz, chief physician of the National Centre for Epidemiology.
That is the number of infections caused by a multidrug-resistant pathogen that has actually been recorded in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
About two thirds of the infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, or methicillin-oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
One third of people carry the Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without developing any disease.
Infections caused by AS (such as angina, tonsillitis, skin infections, traumatic infections) respond well to antibiotics and are easily curable.
However, if antibiotics are used in excess or inappropriately, the bacteria, which respond well to antibiotics, will develop a highly antibiotic-resistant bacteria that will proliferate rapidly in poor hospital conditions.
In the event of temporary or prolonged malfunction of the immune system, this bacterium can cause serious hospital-acquired infections, such as traumatic infection or sepsis, in elderly, underweight or weakened patients.
According to the chief physician of János Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infections, these infections are part of the daily life of hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, we do not find MRSA only there or we do not look for them, said Tibor Nyulasi.
The SA is resistant to antibiotics.
"These patients are isolated, the healthcare staff put on rubber gloves and protective masks and we have appropriate antibiotics to treat them", said Tibor Nyulasi.
Initially, patients in hospital are screened for MRSA, but infection cannot always be prevented.
Sampling is not the new trend
The vast majority of infections caused by MRSA could be prevented but the current conditions and circumstances in Hungarian hospitals are not conducive to preventing the development and proliferation of multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection is most prevalent in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should monitor hospitalized patients and isolate patients with MRSA immediately.
However, microbiological sampling is not in vogue in Hungarian hospitals.
It should be noted that the National Social Insurance Fund does not finance these examinations.
Most cases are not diagnosed until the MRSA infection is detectable in the patient, said the chief physician of the epidemiological center.
The European Union has strict guidelines on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also Hungarian guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts must be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, in other words microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take this into account.
Microbiological testing is even more rare in outpatient and primary care, said Karolina Böröcz.
Many hospitals are cutting back on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most often spread from one patient to another through medical personnel.
It is therefore essential to wash hands, wear gloves and face masks, but there are significant shortcomings in hospitals in this area as well.
MRSA proliferates through infection transmitted by inhalation of droplets and through contact. However, due to the conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient cannot always be isolated.
In addition, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too close to each other, while in terms of epidemics, patients should be separated from each other by at least 1.5 meters.
Unfortunately, we also see that hospitals, in a difficult financial situation, are saving on disinfectants, they lack nurses, the sick are numerous, so the risk of contamination is even greater, said Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals where preventive measures are followed, the number of infections is demonstrably lower or the spread of the pathogen can be blocked.
Government project against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection is an exorbitant expense for the social security funds, which is why we are fighting this infection everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has set up a programme to prevent or reduce the incidence of MRSA.
According to published data, this programme is effective and MRSA infections are showing a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has identified as one of its priorities the prevention of the incidence of multi-resistant pathogens (such as MRSA) and the prevention of hospital-acquired infections caused by these pathogens.
The police commissioner, who caused a fatal accident, was not drunk.
The official report of the fatal accident caused by the 22nd precinct commissioner has been drawn up.
It can be ruled out that the commissioner of the 22nd district, resigned from his post since, who hit a pedestrian causing his death last Tuesday, would have driven drunk or dizzy, said Friday Attila Morvai, spokesman for the Ministry of Public prosecution of the capital after the relevant finding was established.
The finding confirmed the initial outcome of the inquiry which had already found that the former Commissioner had not consumed alcohol before driving
Last Tuesday, the former head of the police station in the 22nd district ran over a 55-year-old man who was in front of him when he turned his car on Kossuth Lajos Street in the 22nd district.
(In addition, the fact that he was crossing the road outside the pedestrian crossing does not constitute an extenuating circumstance, as the Highway Code requires that a car that starts a turn must allow pedestrians to pass.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
Following this accident, the commissioner resigned from his post and asked for his retirement because, according to the police report, this accident had upset him very much.
The investigation into this case is being conducted by the Public Prosecutor's Office in Budapest.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former Commissioner had cooperated from the beginning with the magistrates in charge of conducting the investigation.
EUR 400 million for the construction of a new
The Hungarian finance minister, János Veres, and the vice-president of the European Investment Bank, Marta Gajecka, signed three agreements in Budapest on Friday for a credit line worth €400 million to support education, transport infrastructure, the environment and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million for the Hungarian budget financing of transport and environment projects to be implemented from the Cohesion Fund, for which a credit agreement worth EUR 100 million has already been signed by the parties.
The agreement on the EUR 150 million loan also covers the budgetary financing of education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary, with the remaining EUR 150 million to be used later, following the extension of the loan agreement.
The parties signed a contract for innovation worth 50 million euro, which the state budget will use primarily for the research and development project to be carried out at the University of Debrecen.
The project for metro line 4 was also discussed during the negotiations.
The parties agreed that they would discuss the possible modification of the original contract again when Hungary had finalised the details of the financing of the metro with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could happen in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has provided a total of EUR 8.4 billion to finance 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB grants loans at the interest rate linked to EURIBOR, with a grace period of 8 years and without any commitment commission.
Bulgaria, the EU's housing market paradise
The evolution of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, the attention of the whole of Europe is turned to this Balkan country that was little mentioned in the past.
What, or who bought in this EU market which is always the cheapest but which will soon become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Bulgaria is currently the most popular real estate target in Eastern Europe with its cheap ski apartments and seaside houses.
In the mountains, the most popular areas are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, by the sea, Albena, the "Golden Sands", the "Sun Coast", the old Sozopol and Nessebar but more and more people are looking for a property in the Kavarna and Balcik area as well.
According to analysts at Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also arouse the interest of investors and more and more of them are also buying in the very cheap corner of Ruse.
Sofia, the capital, offers attractive opportunities as well, with the commercial and office space offering the highest depreciation rate.
Bulgaria is on track to become one of the most attractive golfing paradises in Europe and thus to be a priority destination, after the summer and winter seasons, also in the other two seasons of the year.
The more vigilant investors are already buying in large numbers, for example in the Bansko area.
According to analysts, people buying real estate in Bulgaria are also looking to change their lives, their lifestyle.
Most of the buyers are English, but others come from France, Belgium, Spain and, increasingly, Romania.
The European Union has also been involved in the development of the European Union's policy on the environment, and in the implementation of the European Union's policy on the environment.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who are planning to move in buy newly renovated buildings, which cost between 50 and 100 thousand euros, or old, dilapidated houses, which cost between 5 and 15 thousand euros, and are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication possibilities, proximity to a large city, shops and, in general, the local doctor.
The second group includes buyers of second homes (since last December, Bulgaria has been listed among the top 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group consists of commercial investors who buy in the hope of realising a capital gain in the medium to long term.
The price of buildings in the capital is rising steadily because of the increasing demand.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but over the last five years, they have increased by 21 percent each year.
The increase in house prices is essentially outstripping the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six percent Hungarian
According to the communication of Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, the meetings of the professionals will end on Tuesday, but on Wednesday, after the official opening, the negotiations of the ministers on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries will discuss the Bali Roadmap, which is supposed to define the efforts to be made after the Kyoto Protocol's emission reduction period until 2012.
There are now lively discussions on this subject between developing and developed countries.
The United States also indicated that, for the moment, it did not wish to discuss exact figures, but that it was ready to sign an agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 40 per cent by 2020 compared to the 1990 level.
Another important topic at the conference is whether developed countries commit, beyond emissions reductions, to providing financial and technological assistance to countries that need it.
An agreement was also signed on aid to developing countries.
The aid fund set up under the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a 16-member board of directors, presumably within the framework of the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), Piac és Profit (Market and Profit) said.
The six per cent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister for the Environment and Water, confirmed the EU's ambition to retain its role as flagship in the global efforts to protect the climate and to encourage the signing of the new international agreement before 2009.
The minister explained that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, irrespective of the success of the post-2012 agreement, and is ready to reduce them by up to 30 per cent if other major regions of the world and/or developing countries are also ready to make commitments appropriate to their responsibility and capabilities.
The Commission is also proposing that the EU should be able to take part in the negotiations on the future of the EU, and that the EU should be able to take part in the negotiations on the future of the EU.
Hungary has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to the level between 1985 and 1987, and our country will meet its commitment, the press release of the Ministry of the Environment recalls.
The stakes are high in Bali because the long-term international agreement on climate policy must be put in place within two years, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be postponed beyond 2012. In that case, the commitments to reduce below the values provided for in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international system for reducing emissions, the need for which was underlined in the new report of the IPCC, the international scientific body, which won the Nobel Peace Prize from the UN, charged with dealing with climate change.
The reduction of emissions would be delayed and the increase in the average temperature of the Earth by more than 2 degrees Celsius could no longer be avoided, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
The British Army is recruiting on YouTube
The video sharing site is used by British Army units to share footage of their operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in order to gain popularity.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) has taken to YouTube: Special Forces units in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of operations against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reported.
These recordings, taken using miniature cameras mounted on the helmet, are monitored at the air force operations headquarters in Kandahar and then they are transferred to London or uploaded by compatriots on the Internet.
The political message is essential
Air Force soldiers have already uploaded 139 videos to the net and their "channel" has been viewed by more than 75,000 people.
The UK Ministry of Defence registered as "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 and posts videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan while the Commonwealth Office and the International Peace Keeping Force in Iraq (IPFI) also have their own YouTube channels.
Mission to Afghanistan
According to the original purpose of the air force, the videos were posted online for recruitment purposes, and according to the Ministry of Defense, they were also used to inform the general public about the real purposes of the army's presence abroad.
The propaganda published by this channel costs practically nothing compared to the usual recruitment advertisements on television, Gordon Mackenzie, a defense consultant, told the BBC. However, it also inevitably carries a political message since it justifies in a special form the justification of military operations decided by the government.
The Americans have made a game
The army is embarrassed because, apart from carefully composed and censored videos, amateur videos have been posted on the sharing site that also show, for example, the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a bit hypocritical, the officers do not avoid talking about the losses but they never show the bloody side of the fight.
In fact, many videos had already been posted online showing the areas of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan that were carried out in real missions, but the British Army has only recently been busy uploading these videos.
The Americans do recruitment a little differently by using the free downloadable rifle game America's Army, in which the player can directly put themselves in the soldiers' shoes in a more or less real simulation.
Christmas tombola and doughnuts in the ministries
Mónika Lamperth, the Labour Minister, does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold an end-of-year meeting with her colleagues who will be able to say goodbye to 2007 with donuts and coffee.
Another ministry will host a party with live music, yet another will delight officials with a raffle and offer drinks to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet, this is how power is entertained.
The public authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
This year, the biggest Christmas party will be hosted by the Ministry of Defence but it's not the Ministry's employees who will be invited.
At Christmas, the children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts from the Orphans, at missionary Christmas, the family members of soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also be held.
The Ministry has a budget of 25 million forints to create the atmosphere of the end of the year.
Compared to other ministries, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will celebrate.
GKM's party will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4 320 000 forints and, out of the six hundred employees wholesale, three hundred and fifty are expected there.
The Christmas party will be a real Christmas party, with actors and a raffle.
The NFÜ Christmas party cost 4 700 000 forints and was held on Wednesday in the National Council of Justice (OIT) building with concerts and a dinner.
The rental of the hall cost one million forints, the rest was spent on the more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, a department of the NFÜ is invited to another Christmas party which is organized with European money by the National Economic Development Center, the company managing the tenders.
The building of the Théâtre de la Gaîté was rented for this purpose.
This information was not confirmed by MAG Zrt because we were unable to contact the person responsible.
The suit is not mandatory.
The ILO building was not only the home of the NFÜ but also of the Ministry of Justice and the Police, which instead of a Christmas party organised a ball on the occasion of St Luke's Day, 7 December.
The ILO did not charge them for the use of its halls.
That ball had five hundred people.
The party began with the welcome words of the Minister and the dinner was followed by a dance party with live music.
Answer to [origo's] question: the evening outfit was not mandatory at all at this ball.
The ministries of health, labor and local government are preparing a sober party.
The Ministry of Health will organize a show and a party for its employees, in its own walls, for 400,000 forints.
However, the Minister of Labour, Mónika Lamperth, does not officially invite her colleagues to a Christmas party but to a year-end work meeting.
One hundred and eighty people are expected to be invited to have coffee and eat donuts, the press service said, and the party will cost only 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister for Local Government, will simply invite his staff to the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development for a drink.
The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be holding a Christmas party in its main hall, where 436 employees are expected.
He plans to spend 2,500 forints per guest, including a buffet and a drink.
Since János Veres' arrival, the employees of the PM celebrate Christmas every year in the same way.
No party atmosphere is foreseen, the official character is reinforced not only by the Minister's speech but also by the time of the party taking place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will be hosting a reception on January 20 to celebrate the new year, Christmas will not be held.
The reception will be held at the Vajdahunyad Castle, located in the City Forest, and according to the Ministry's communication, 1,000 forints per person is calculated for the hundred guests.
According to the press service, it will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, begin with a few words of welcome from the minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture are not celebrating Christmas at all, the respective press services said.
The press service of the Ministry of the Environment did not know the price of the official Christmas party.
However, over four hundred people were invited to the party at the Museum of Decorative Art.
The forces of the mega strike are gathering
The League's unions and the National Association of Workers' Councils will set up their strike committee on Friday, which will be responsible for coordinating the indefinite strike on Monday.
On Saturday, a general protest meeting will be held and on Monday, the day of the final vote on the law on health funds, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause significant traffic jams as rail traffic will be almost completely stopped and BKV employees will also strike until 1pm.
The League's unions will announce details of their Monday strike, organized with the National Association of Workers' Councils, on Friday afternoon.
The strike committee of LIGA-MOSZ will also be formed, it will serve as coordinator of Monday's actions.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and, starting Monday, the organizations joining the strike will stop work indefinitely if they cannot reach an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, from the day of the vote in parliament on the health insurance law, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not pass the health insurance law, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for a strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide what to do next.
According to the agenda for Monday in the National Assembly, the vote on the health insurance bill is likely to take place late in the evening or even at night.
Due to the strike scheduled for Monday, there are expected to be significant traffic jams: the railways will stop work for an indefinite period and during the morning part of the public transport in Budapest and more than half of the Volán companies are at risk of being stopped.
At the same time, at different points in the country, half the track will also be blocked.
Many unions and civil society organisations have joined the call for a strike, and the list of these is constantly updated on the League's website.
Some organisations report that they are on indefinite strike, others have declared a temporary work stoppage.
As of Thursday afternoon, the MÁV (Hong Kong Railways) and the Free Railway Workers' Union (VDSZSZ) had not been able to reach an agreement on minimum services, and as the Christmas holidays approach, more and more people are taking the train.
According to the current communications, the public transport in Budapest will strike from the beginning of service until 1 pm, the Budapest airport between 7 and 9 am, the Electricity and Thermal Energy Industrial Unions of the League will strike for four hours, the Teachers' Union and the Democratic Teachers' Union called for a strike for 2 hours and 2 hours to 8 hours respectively.
The National Association of Doctors will strike nationwide in alternating shifts, the Health and Social Workers' Union (EDDSZ) affiliated to the SZEF will strike for two hours.
The most important of the four demands put forward by the League is that the government withdraw its proposal for health reform and submit a new concept to the social debate.
The second claim requires that the new method of pension calculation to be introduced from next year be introduced in several stages.
The third demand is for a guarantee of early retirement, which would allow the system to be filled with the functions it deserves before 2010.
The fourth ground of appeal is the rejection by the Free Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ), which is affiliated to the League of Trade Unions, of the proposal of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport concerning secondary railway lines and the expectation of another proposal.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increased country risk
According to Political Capital's Risk Analysis Division, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, which was formed last August with the support of Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom (Movement for a Better Hungary), increases the political risk of Hungary and the region in several ways.
In its  risk warning , the company notes that the biggest political risk in relation to the Hungarian Guard's activity is already that  in the short term aggressive ethnic clashes may occur as a result of the worsening of the already existing ethnic tension between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy population of Hungary .
The research institute added that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy to bring about this situation is the main reason.
As they say, this is due to one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political actors:  the public actors have passed the public debate on the Roma issue to the representatives of radical and extreme political groups who have based a political strategy on the dispute between the Gypsies and the Hungarians .
The problem is aggravated, normal dialogue is made impossible, extremists are empowered and aggressive conflict is more likely, they say.
However, according to the research institute, the increased attention of the Hungarian and international media to the activity of the Hungarian Guard  has significantly damaged Hungary's image abroad, especially regarding confidence in the country's stability and democratic maturity .
They recall that, following greater publicity given to the reorganisation of Hungarian radical and far-right groups since autumn 2006, many associations have been established in Hungary since summer 2007 calling themselves the National Self-Defense Association.
 The common feature of these rallies is that they define themselves as a civil organization while publicly declaring the readiness of their members for defense missions (disasters, national defense, defense of order), armed if necessary, moreover, by evoking the inadequacy of the police, the army, in other words the state , they added.
They reported that everything was done according to the method which, based on the resentment of society of politics and parties, seeks to disguise different political ambitions under a civil aspect.
The emphasis on civil character and association status thus not only serves to avoid the legal pitfalls of registering such associations in court but also constitutes a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor that also increases the risk in relation to neighbourly relations.
 In recent months, many neighbouring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk and ultra-nationalist political actors in some neighbouring countries have sought to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the Hungarian Guard constitution.
This is affecting the political stability of the region, they added.
According to the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, political risks have increased across the region.
As they say, the functioning of the Hungarian Guard resembles, for example, the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The numerous Roma riots that broke out in a district of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) led to the formation of the Bulgarian Guard.
Taking advantage of these events, the BNU decided to form a guard, saying that the purpose of the organization is  national self-defense .
According to them, over the past 17 years, the Gypsies have "terrorized" Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and neutral, recalls Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had generated lively debate in Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the declaration by some Bulgarian Roma organizations of the constitution of their own guards as a form of resistance signals the increased risk of ethnic clashes.
The functioning of the Hungarian Guard, which has similarities with the Bulgarian National Guard, does not preclude that Hungarian Roma react to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defence, according to the risk warning of Political Capital.
At the request of the telegraph agency, Attila Juhász, research director of Political Capital, said: "Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published every year and if events occur that could have an impact on the change in risk, they inform the public, as in this case, by publishing a risk warning.
The party's not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines the exact dates of public holidays and it has become common practice to reorganise working days around the holidays, the number of which will decrease next year.
The holidays are not uniform across the EU and the US as well.
The Hungarian legislation distinguishes between national and state holidays and rest days.
Holidays are often associated with religious holidays or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the New Year, the last day of the year that ends and the first day of the New Year is also a day of rest, the latter especially so that the awakeners can rest quietly.
In addition, in a year, we have eleven festivals marked in red.
March 15 is a national holiday, commemorating the 1848 revolution, as is October 23 which is the commemorative day of the 1956 revolution.
August 20th is our state's founding day, May 1st is Labor Day, and November 1st and 2nd are our memorial days for family and friends who have passed away.
Besides, we have two days in Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
Since the days of our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, it has become common practice to re-arrange the working days in cases where there is only one working day left before or after the holiday marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price of extended weekends by working or going to school on the Saturday before the extended weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has laid down special rules for the replacement of days before or after holidays.
The law extends to all employers and to all their employees, to civil servants and to persons working in the public service.
It does not, however, apply to service societies, institutions which are in continuous operation and in service by virtue of their vocation, and also to days of rest.
This year, working days will be changed only around the end of the year holidays: from December 24 onwards, life almost stops in the whole country because according to experiments the majority of people rather work overtime or take holidays that they have saved for these purposes in order to be able to spend the days between Christmas and New Year's Day at home.
Next year many holidays fall in the middle or at the end of the week, so there will be fewer changes in the working days compared to this year.
The schedule will be reorganized the first time around Labor Day to allow employees to stay home for four days straight.
Saturday, April 25th will be a working day, with a rest day on Friday, May 2nd.
Another change is planned for 23 October: Saturday, 18 October, will be a working day, replacing Friday, 24 October.
However, next year, the end of the year is coming under the sign of the holidays because from December 24, everyone will take a non-stop break even if New Year's Day falls on a Wednesday.
Six trifles that can really annoy coworkers
E-mails we forget to send, voice messages we never receive, innocent lies that almost annoy us more - these are things that  beautify  the everyday workplace.
The question is whether we get used to these problems or we take up the challenge and consciously avoid ambiguous situations, causing problems for others.
Give examples.
"Excuse me, I forgot to tell you that you got a call from the marketing department", a colleague says.
That you missed a date?
At best he is sorry and tries to fix things by calling the marketing department to tell them he forgot to pass the message (this is the least common solution).
In most cases, the matter is settled with an apology.
Before you give any unpleasant explanations, it is helpful to think about how you might cause unpleasant situations to your coworkers and to make efforts to avoid them.
You borrow something that doesn't belong to you?
There's nothing more annoying than wanting to pick up a file, a desk tool or your phone and it's nowhere to be found.
Do you remember the day before you put the stapler on the desk but it was gone the next morning?
You find your pen you thought was missing on your co-worker's desk?
Don't take anything from your coworkers without asking, or they'll be rightly angry at you for stealing their property.
Don't bring envelopes, post-its in your pocket because it can be annoying that there are no more and you need it right away.
You're talking about the private lives of your coworkers?
There are no good ways to stop gossip from spreading.
Who did what with who?
Or why?
Do not share your (supposed) information about the privacy of your colleagues!
If a fellow worker shares intimate secrets with you, do not abuse his trust!
Bury the information you've shared and don't discuss it with your co-workers in his absence even if your co-workers know about it too.
You call in sick for no good reason?
When you call the office and you call in sick under the pretext of a tearing headache because you feel sick or you feel you need to rest that day, remember that your work, your urgent business, your missions in the future must be done by someone else instead of you.
Don't bother your coworkers!
If you know in advance that you will not be at work the next day or that something may happen that will require you to stay at home, be sure to let your boss and your coworkers know so that they will not be surprised that you will be absent the next day.
Flirting, laughing, and calling
You're immersed in your work, but the nagging of your colleagues suddenly pulls you away?
Have you unintentionally become an eyewitness to a telephone conversation that you should have ignored?
Do not disturb your co-workers by humming, singing, loudly arguing (leading over their heads), kicking, cursing or loudly complaining.
They can be annoying even if your colleagues are not immersed in a project (writing, designing, organising).
You blame others for a mistake?
If you miss a deadline, or if you forget to send an important message or e-mail, do not blame yourself!
Don't blame it on the chaos in the office or on your noisy coworkers!
If you have done wrong, admit it, and if it has caused harm to others, make amends.
Ask how you can make amends for your mistake, make up for your negligence!
Do you feel too at home in the office?
Wearing a jogging boot and shoes is comfortable at home but not in the office!
Don't wear a comfortable jogging suit even if your function allows it!
Don't be sloppy, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing properly, and if your job requires it by wearing nice and stylish clothes, to go to work.
If you want to live up to expectations, you're no longer interesting.
We're slowly moving into the usual morning rush.
Suddenly, a special melody comes over the radio - the sound of a violin and its associated electronic effects.
I'll turn it up.
The music changes rhythm and the bass comes in to accompany the notes of the hour, then a female choir joins in like a jewel.
Mr. Zagar's Wings of Love is playing on Mr. 2.
Hungarian musical life has not spoiled us for a long time with good quality electronic pop.
Now, it seems the cork is different if you listen to Zagar's new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few interesting new productions born of the Hungarian digital underground are slowly beginning to change the overall picture and, despite the new fashion of garage rock tearing the guitar, Hungarian electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer came from Pécs and he played in Yonderboi's band before he started his own path, maybe because there is no room for two feet in one shoe.
His project (Zagar) and his music, a mixture of jazz, electronic dance music and pop, began to become known when he was entrusted with the composition of the soundtracks of films (e.g.
The season of Ferenc Török).
The band, which started out playing in small clubs, became known to a wider audience when wan2 magazine named their 2002 debut album among the fifty most important records in the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, along with Yonderboi, as the only Hungarian trendsetters who would be as competitive in the West.
Zagar and his ensemble have become undeniably  trendy  but no one has asked them if they want to wear that label.
The band reacted right, they put out a new and better record.
The album entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, released recently, can open new paths for them, although the title wants to represent a continuity with the years spent in Pécs.
It was a line from Balázs Zságer's old band in Pécs.
We are well with the reference to flight but next to the aerial music now appears, following the spirit and trend of the time, the guitar louder, rock and roll impact.
György Ligeti, a singer currently working in England with the band The Puzzle, showed his talent in these songs during the album's premiere at Millennium Park.
On the album, we find a real tube for the radio, mr2 Petõfi, broadcasting popular music from morning to night, began to introduce the melodies of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
So everything is fine?
The Commission has asked questions to Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new video makes me ask a question: has your music remained a music aimed at a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: The term music aimed at a certain layer doesn't mean much to me.
For me, there are two castes in light music: not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial music and sincere music.
So-called alternative, underground music can also be mediocre and made only to sell and thus become commercial.
But a good pop song can be sincere, too.
The attitude of reception works in this spirit also regardless of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between Hungarian and foreign audiences, is either one more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially in the West, light music has older traditions.
People go to concerts, and not just teenagers and 20-somethings, but older people as well.
They are much more attentive to the changes in light music because they think it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in who, or how many people, are listening to your music?
Zs.B.: I'm obviously glad to see more and more people coming to our concerts.
However, we never made music for the market.
We don't make music to achieve a goal but for a specific reason.
The role of the audience is more important at concerts where mutual influence already works but it is only perceived in the elusive changes of the moment.
Now, I've noticed that if you want to meet the audience's expectations, you're not going to be any more interesting.
hvg.hu: Are you planning to follow Yonderboi's example?
He works alone and has made a career rather in the west.
Zs.B.: We don't really follow his path even though sometimes people try to find traces in our music.
We're more like team players who trust each other's musical presence and let it unfold.
At first, it was inevitable that our music would be compared to Yonderboi's because many of us left his band and went on to other things.
hvg.hu: Wings of Love is the number one song on Mr. Petõfi's hit list.
Many of them first heard the name Zagar through this song.
With this more popular style you've consciously opened up to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We don't plan to make a tube so we can sell the record.
This song means more than that.
We wanted it for the album's ending to try and soften the orgy of sounds and the more difficult themes that were addressed throughout the record.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why they - what was the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel choir.
We had the idea to compose this choir of good soloists of the Hungarian music scene.
The choir was composed of six members, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh, who were later called Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like this or did the girls change it a bit?
Zs.B.: This song had already existed for a long time in an instrumental version and then when we composed the album, we thought that there was still something missing from this song.
The string of chords drew the voice of the song.
I sang the same melody that the girls learned later that night.
I got it almost immediately and it was all terribly spontaneous.
I remember it galvanizing me at the time, but sure, we needed the Divas.
With my voice, it wouldn't have had the same power.
hvg.hu: On the record and at the concert too it seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There are no solos (except for a short solo by Judy Jay), they have no solo roles, they all sing together and they don't sing louder than the music, so the music doesn't just accompany their singing.
They were backstage, too.
Is that what you want?
ZsB: The fact that they were in the background is due solely to technical problems.
But what was voluntary was that we didn't want to give out soloist roles.
The song also says that we have to forget our ego a little bit, forget who came from where, who is going or, we just have to let these wings, the wings of love, carry us away.
I wanted others to feel the same euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which of the songs made you work the hardest?
ZsB: Actually, no. As for the process of creating music, we had more difficult pieces during the mixing.
Like, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I'm playing a concert piano, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't work for a long time, and then, little by little, it all came together like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song on the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I already released this record.
Right now, they're doing Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The rogue trader who risked billions because of his inferiority complex
A fraud who hides.
So says his former employee at the French giant Société Générale, owner of the Czech bank Komerční banka.
He lost the bank almost five billion euros.
It seems that Kerviel is just a great player who wanted to be equal to his colleagues, and who, moreover, can not be considered as incapable.
Unlike all the big banks, he recognized the crisis in the U.S. mortgage market early.
"He's fragile", his superiors said, and they reported him to the police.
However, if we stick to Kerviel's testimony reported by the French media, including Le Monde, the transactions of this man produced a profit of 1.6 billion euros at the end of last year.
The crisis is not limited to the United States
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank", he said in the deposition.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the American recession to earn half a billion euros.
In fact, he sensed the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, reports began to emerge that so-called sub-prime mortgages, granted to low-income customers or to those who had experienced difficulties in repaying them in the past, would be in trouble.
But this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe in it and he bet well.
Thus, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to 1.6 billion euros.
"As soon as I had made my first half-billion, I didn't know how to announce it", Kerviel confesses, adding that he, of course, kept nothing for himself".
During the interrogation, he admits to falsifying the reports so he wouldn't be traced.
He managed to fool his superiors, although the Eurex stock exchange had begun to take an interest in his transactions.
Who doesn't risk anything has nothing
Was he afraid of being discovered?
I'm not sure.
"I thought that the mere fact of getting $1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them".
Why is he willing to risk so much?
He only got to his position gradually.
He started working for Société Générale in 2000 just after finishing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51 thousand.
Two years later, he was already a trader's assistant, and in 2005, he became an independent trader with an annual salary of 90 thousand dollars.
But he knew he'd never make as much as the others.
"From my first interview in 2005, I knew I was much less respected than others.
In view of my university education and my professional and personal background", Kerviel told the investigators.
Soon after taking office, he achieved his first great success.
Thanks to Allianz shares, he made half a billion euros betting on the decline of this stock during the London bombings.
And the mechanism was triggered - he wanted more.
As long as you win, you're left in peace.
"It was like a snowball effect", he told the police.
But the higher-ups knew everything, or rather, suspected it.
"As long as I won, they pretended to turn a blind eye".
And then the blow of the beginning of the year comes.
He's losing a billion euros in one day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decides to hide the money.
Monday, when he comes to work, he's no longer an employee of the bank.
A few days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5 billion euros because of him.
And how did we find out?
He's become a suspect because of his leave.
"Last year, I only took four days off.
A trader who does not take a holiday is a trader who does not want to leave his book to someone else", Kerviel concludes.
The Czech Republic has a chance to get 365 billion
The Czech government ministers signed yesterday a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could bring in €14 billion (about CZK 365 billion) for the Czech Republic in the coming years.
This is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can get from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Almost SEK 125 billion from seven operational programmes will be allocated to the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain approximately 100 billion crowns under the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
The transport sector will benefit the most, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and accounts for up to 22% of the financial resources that the Czech Republic can obtain under these projects.
This money will be the source of an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage next year a sum of 90.8 billion crowns.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme, which is aimed at SMEs and entrepreneurs, is intended to provide financial resources to encourage innovation within the company.
The enterprises should be given financial resources for the introduction of new technologies, industrial research, but also for the introduction of new and more efficient management methods.
Until now, the Czech Republic was one of the least successful recipients of EU funds among new members.
The court upheld the 20-year prison sentence for former president of Nicaragua
Nicaragua's Court of Appeal on Thursday upheld the 20-year prison sentence for former president Arnold Alemán, who was convicted in 2003 of defrauding the country of $100 million.
Later, however, he was released and was confined to his hacienda near the capital of Nicaragua.
Whether the former Central American leader, in office between 1997 and 2002, will be imprisoned again is not clear at the moment, according to the AP agency.
According to the president of the Court of Appeal Ileana Pérez, everything will now depend on the prison officers, whether they will let Aleman finish his sentence at home or go back to prison.
Four years ago, the court found that Alemán regularly moved government money to offshore company accounts in Panama.
These were shell companies, and the accounts were actually owned by his family members and his closest supporters.
Some of the money went to the fund Alemán created to finance his 2001 election campaign.
The budget has been adopted.
That's the way it is.
The state budget has been passed.
What makes this budget so special?
This is the first budget that this government has put together and that has been accepted by the majority of the government without the support of the opposition.
The one for this year was passed a year ago with the support of the Czech Socialist Party - ČSSD, since it was Minister Sobotka who prepared it and ČSSD could not afford to refuse it.
Unlike the heated debate before the vote of no confidence in the government, this time nothing dramatic.
The House of Representatives passed this law without any problems, which, although the most influential, is usually ignored.
There's a paradox to that.
Whether we like it or not, each chapter and each article is the beginning and the end of any government.
The budget is a constituent part of politics, although it is hidden behind the power competition between government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive in the media and that is why we pay more attention to it in the media.
The arguments of politicians are much more interesting to the public than the abrupt figures.
The national budgets of the past socialist governments suffered from three problems which the present budget is not able to solve at once:
The first is the large share of the expenses for mandates imposed by law, consisting not only of pensions but also of social security contributions, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" of the parties ČSSD and KSČM.
The second is a deficit economy, the consequence of the first evil.
The third obstacle is the deficit of public finances, that is, the deficit of cities and municipalities.
However, the state budget deficit is not the biggest concern.
It is public and relatively controlled.
The real time bomb is the deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often issued bonds in a daze, indebting their municipalities excessively, in order to obtain, in addition to money from taxes, duties and bank credits, new sources of investment.
In the past, they have been able to repay these debts by selling in bulk shares in the distribution systems, particularly in energy, which were obtained from the State through privatisation.
Today, they no longer have that source.
If we stick to the official and verifiable facts only, we find that:
Our economy has been going through a growth phase for several years now, just like the rest of the world, and ČSSD is not without its share of the danger.
It was a unique opportunity for successive governments of this party to regularize public finances.
Instead, they were driving the state deeper into debt.
Other countries, with a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania and Egypt, have managed their affairs in a much more reasonable way than our republic.
This is a monstrous disgrace which has been borne mainly by previous governments.
We are one of the countries with the lowest poverty rate in the world.
We therefore have no need for massive social programmes which have unfortunately been unnecessarily bloated in recent years.
Although we have managed to suppress some of the absurd populist spending approved last year before the elections, if a shift in the retirement age limit and a reform of the pension system do not take place soon, then all politics will cease to exist in this country and whoever is in power will only be administering.
It is no exaggeration to say that politicians in power will become bureaucrats who mechanically distribute the majority of taxed money between pensions and social benefits.
That is why the present budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism by which ordinary expenses are offset by the expenses of mandates.
The $70 billion deficit forecast for 2008 would be absolutely useless if previous governments hadn't spent all the money they could.
If we really do not want the politicians in power to become mere bureaucrats, we must be patient and allow this fragile government coalition, which is aware that the State can only spend the equivalent of what it has to collect in taxes and tax duties, the necessary calm to prepare new reform laws.
Only the latter will gradually achieve a balanced state budget.
I 'm not sure .
Banks want to solve the crisis
The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, the European Central Bank and the central banks of England, Switzerland and Canada have agreed to fight the crisis in the financial markets together.
More than $100 billion will be placed on the money markets through auctions.
This will be for the banks to sell, through an auction system, the interest rates at which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the US Fed will auction off $40 billion and, in addition, it will provide $24 billion to the European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time since the September 11 attacks that the central banks of individual countries have decided to take such concerted action to prevent or even lessen the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to address the major problems of the economy, namely the growing shortage of free capital that banks could lend", wrote Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group in his report to clients.
"The concerted action of central banks has reduced the probability of a recession in the United States from 65 per cent to about 50 per cent", Baumohl adds in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion in unpaid loans, mostly in the United States.
Analysts are expecting billions more in losses.
"If central banks have chosen this approach, they must really understand what may follow", says ABN chief economist Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad", he added.
The central banks fear that if banks themselves have difficulty in accessing loans, they will lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the US economy into a recession that could affect economic growth worldwide.
Central banks made this choice after the failure to lower the London interbank rate, called LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still apprehensive about mutual borrowing, despite the fact that the US, Canadian and British central banks had cut their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"It will have the same effect as a further decline in interest rates", said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the central banks' approach will help to avert the crisis, since it does not solve the main problem which is the collapse of the US housing market.
President Klaus: the debates of environmentalists are incredible
Global climate change is expected to hit developing countries hardest.
President Václav Klaus spoke again about the problem of global warming.
The criticism this time has been directed at the UN International Climate Change Conference ending in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, Not Green, he said that the debates of environmentalists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, which is a curious mix of government and NGO representatives, that is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality.
"The debate is not structured at all, it is a rocket of words, instead of solutions to the current problems", said Klaus.
The Czech President stressed, at the presentation of his book, that the subject matter is of great importance to him and that is why he is so committed to this cause.
He also expressed satisfaction that his book was also being published in German translation, since, he said, "I often only encounter the caricature of my opinions".
Now, interested persons can read his positions without being distorted.
Klaus recalled that although he was not a climatologist, he had enough knowledge to write such a book.
He is an academic who can follow and appreciate scientific treatises, he has a statistical background and he is also an economist.
The main conclusions of the book are, according to him, the following: the climate is constantly changing, changes in it are therefore normal, there is no consensus among all researchers on global warming, the effects of current changes are neither too large nor too severe, so they pose no danger, and, finally, efforts to influence climate change are useless, ineffective and unacceptably expensive.
Especially as he has experience of a totalitarian regime, he considers it unacceptable to impose unverified opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous infringement of freedom.
In response to questions from those present, he explained on several occasions that he was not against "a reasonable protection of the environment, but against a fundamentalist environmentalism which does not take into account the relationship between costs and the profit they bring".
In Vienna, Klaus had already spoken about this two months ago, at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people failed to renew their driving licence in time
Six hundred thousand drivers have missed the deadline and have not been able to renew their old driving licence, which is due to expire at the end of the year.
We are the last day that people can still apply for renewal, so that the authorities have the means to issue them a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without valid licenses will be on the road.
According to the authorities, they have not renewed their driving license, especially those who no longer want to drive.
While municipalities report a drop in the number of applications for license renewal, authorities in the capital are overwhelmed with applications and the number of applications for license renewal has been increasing this week.
The Town Hall caters to about 2000 customers a day.
There's a line for about a half an hour.
In Prague, nearly 140,000 drivers have not yet renewed their driving licences.
It takes 20 days to get a new license.
However, it is possible to apply for a discharge within a shorter period of five days.
In this case, the driver pays an additional five hundred crowns.
Drivers who fail to renew their driving licences by the end of the year and drive without a valid licence will be fined from January.
The offender will be forced to pay a fine of two thousand crowns.
However, the police can also deal with the offence by using a friendly approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine increases to 2500 kroner.
According to old information, was liable to a fine even a person who was not going to circulate.
She could be forced to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry had called on the authorities to exercise restraint and to impose fines not exceeding 1000 kroner.
However, according to the Ministry of Transport spokesman Karel Hanzelka, no one is at risk of fines in the tens of thousands.
The driving licence is a document which people can decide whether they want to have it or not.
It is not like an identity card, which must be valid without exception.
People who no longer wish to drive should hand over their driving licence.
It is sufficient to bring it or send it to the relevant municipality.
Driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, drivers are also obliged to renew other types of driving licences gradually.
Persons with documents dating from 1994 to 2000 have three years to renew them.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million other documents.
The court reduced the sentences of the detectives who had a deal with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, former police officers accused of colluding with David Berdych's gang, will serve 13 and 10 years in prison respectively.
The Prague High Court thus sentenced them definitively by reducing their sentences by 1 and 2 years respectively.
Originally, detectives in the Department for Combating Organized Crime faced 14 and 12 years in prison.
There is no appeal against today's decision, only an appeal to the High Court.
Although Berdych is also accused in this case, he is currently awaiting the verdict of the first instance.
However, he has already received sentences totalling more than 16 years in prison in other cases.
He can't take more.
In January, the District Court found 19 people guilty of participating in robberies, and the Superior Court was hearing the appeals of 16 of them today.
Most of the defendants questioned the prosecution from the beginning of the investigation, saying that it was a manipulated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Court of Justice, the police, after an agreement among others with Berdych, passed on to the criminals information from police sources, covered up the various robberies and helped the gang members to avoid criminal liability.
The gang would give Opava and Koňařík 30 percent of the theft in return.
The indictment refers to the criminal activity of the gang in the years 1999 to 2001.
The Commission has already taken a number of measures to ensure that the Community's financial aid is not used to the detriment of the victims of armed robbery.
The police, when searching homes, have found illegally owned pistols, shells with steel cores, laser sighting and machine guns.
According to the charges, the gang has amassed tens of millions of crowns.
Apart from about 20 men in this trial, the courts have already convicted Berdych and a whole host of others of theft.
Other men from Berdych's neighborhood are still in court in another case, some cases have not yet reached the court.
The main hearing avoided, for the moment, Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej who are currently in detention in Ireland, where they are awaiting the final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The cost of the substitution of children: 12 million
The lawyer of the families of the victims Igor Veleba wants to get from the Třebíč hospital a compensation of 12 million crowns plus expenses.
Three million for each of the mothers, two million for the fathers and one million for each of the children.
The hospital is offering a maximum of $200,000 for each parent.
That is why the lawyer of the hospital Ondřej Dostál is absolutely not in agreement with Veleba's proposal.
"We reject such a claim, it is very, very high", Dostál said after the hearing.
"In order to be able to form an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need the expert report which the opposing party has commissioned.
Let's see if this one has any explanatory value.
But we continue to think that the total should not exceed hundreds of thousands", Dostál stressed.
The amount should, according to him, be set at between 100,000 and 200,000 CZK for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jabloňov's family demanded one million crowns for each month they could not raise their biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, which was prepared for him by the University Hospital Centre in Prague-Motol, as a supporting document for the negotiations on the compensation.
According to psychological and psychiatric experts, the parents suffered psychological damage and were subject to stress of varying degrees and depth.
The stress was better tolerated by the men, although they were confronted with the remorse of not being able to prevent the substitution of newborns.
Women, on the other hand, are less calm about the experience of trauma in the news and about what is happening precisely at this time, summarized the content of the Veleba report.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the hospital in Třebíč on 9 December last year.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermák family in Přibyslavice and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jabloňov.
At the end of October, the governor of the Vysočina region, Miloš Vystrčil, gave each of the families 100,000 krona to reimburse the expenses incurred by the mistake of the Třebíč hospital run by the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are obliged by law to have civil liability insurance.
In case of failure, they must draw on the reserve fund, exceptionally, they can ask the manager for help.
Until now, the courts have awarded relatively small damages, the amounts calculated from the tables being in the hundreds of thousands, exceptionally in the millions.
Polívka has lost the Valašské Království (the Kingdom of Valašsko) which was the first to be established in the country.
Bolek Polívka has lost the case concerning the Valašské království (Kingdom of Valašsko) trade mark.
According to the judge of the regional court of Ostrava, it was indeed he who first used the title King of Valašsko, but the project was set up by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, the actor's former collaborator.
Polívka was not present at today's hearing.
But according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The dispute is about Mr. Harabiš and his team parasitizing the popularity of Bolekív Polka", Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, the words Kingdom of Valašsko remind everyone of this actor and comedian.
Harabiš agrees with me.
"We have almost ten years of work behind us.
"We are looking for money and events", he said.
He thinks money is the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful and that they could benefit from it.
They are the ones who want to parasitize our work", he added.
A profitable business
According to the court, it was Polívka who first used the title Valašský král (King of Valašsko) in his TV show.
The actor Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned him king in 1993.
But back then, it had nothing to do with the project of setting up a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing passports from the Valašské Království.
From a humorous action at the beginning, a business and a lucrative commercial activity emerged, followed by the creation, by Harabiš, of the Valašské království company.
In 1997 Polívka agreed to have her name and signature mentioned in the passport and even offered holders of the passport balances on the price of visits to her farm and theatrical performances.
Who's gonna sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš only used the nude idea, published by Polívka in the show manéž, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka certainly helped the Valašské království project", said the judge.
She added, however, that the heart of the project was Harabiš and his team who were devoted to the project in an intense way.
The collaboration between the now hostile parties continued until 2000 when Harabiš arranged for Polívka to be officially crowned in Vsetín.
But from then on, conflicts began to build up between Polívka and Harabiš, which culminated in the deposition of "King Boleslav I elected for ever".
The leading role in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabiš, assumed by the singer Jarmila Šuláková as Queen Mother.
Then, in 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Harabiš and his company, a request that the court has today rejected.
What might help to solve the case is the tournament for the throne and half the princess.
A new king should come out.
He didn't want to give up the details and the date yet.
"We don't want to rush into things.
It would be something like the parade of kings in Slovácko.
The king would be elected for a certain time.
Even Mr Polívka can of course register", added Harabiš.
The Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi test: the end of prejudice
I'll be honest, I was never a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its handling qualities were not extraordinary, the quality of the gear change, the driving and also that of the manufacture could, in many respects, be described as below average.
Now, however, its successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market.
Especially since the SW-named combo is going one step further, I have to think about it.
When I was testing the classic hatchback Peugeot 207 I complained about the headroom in the back seats, for example.
So that's the end of the complaints because the combi bodywork means that even the big devils will be, in this respect, comfortable.
Let's see what we can do.
I will refer very quickly to the interior so that I do not repeat myself too much.
It's a pretty good design, my only comment about the central tunnel, which I think is poor.
Now, I would have liked a little more inventive design, given that the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the days of complaining about chairs or too short a briefcase are over.
The lateral guidance has also been markedly improved over the 206 model.
As for the space, the increase in the dimensions of the bodywork is also noticeable there.
The combi also sees the lack of space above the head already mentioned disappear.
A safe in the safe
So the most important thing about this vehicle is its luggage compartment.
I must rate this one as very well accessible (also thanks to the rear swivel glass) and of a rather easy fitting.
The blind spaces are fitted with stop elastics which are an ideal compromise.
It is not bulky and can be extended while being able to hold quite heavy objects.
But let's stop at the volume.
According to the tables, this one produces 428 litres in the basic configuration, which is a rather average figure compared to the competition.
Apart from the Škoda Fabia Combi, the best-selling vehicle of this category in the Czech Republic.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of Mlada Boleslav's product, we find that the Peugeot is very noticeably behind, the difference being 52 litres.
When it comes to going on holiday abroad or loading a stroller, this figure is almost critical.
But if I were to point out the advantages, I would mention the undercarriage remaining after the rear seat backs have been turned perfectly straight, or a very low footrest.
120 horses on four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder Otto engine with a volume of 1.6 litres and a power of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, this is what a 1.6 should look like when it's driving a family hatchback.
It's quiet, it consumes little, and most importantly, it grows well.
If I compare it to the equivalent produced by Škoda which often gives the impression of having a tailpipe blocked by a sweeper, then I can only be enthusiastic.
Let's go through the rates.
The price of the vehicle is not affordable for everyone.
However, one must be aware that we have tested a car that is quite well equipped, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The base price of a vehicle with a 1.4 litre Otto engine of 329 900 Kč is still reasonable.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410,900 Kč, which is already enough.
The premium equipment, also tested, increases the price by 80 000 Kč.
We have also had head-airbags, automatic air-conditioning, automatic windshield wipers, automatic rear window controls, and so on.
In fact, the vehicle costs at the end of the account 531,900 CZK.
That's a lot, but try to add the extra equipment to the price of the Fabia and you get a very similar figure.
So all that's left is to choose the brand.
The integration of Slovak pupils into British schools is going badly
The number of children from Eastern Europe in British schools is increasing, causing concern amongst the residents about the evolution of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing a number of obstacles.
British schools have even seen cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of the original inhabitants have turned violent.
The case of northern Kent, where conflicts between immigrants of Slovak origin and immigrants of Slovak origin are becoming more acute, illustrates the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
The quarrels, the squabbles and the fights between the pupils have been transferred to the relations between the parents.
The situation went so far that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who was beating a ten-year-old student with an iron bar.
The accused defends himself by claiming that the boy insulted him with racist remarks.
Police also had to intervene following the attack on a Slovakian immigrant by two teenage girls.
The girls allegedly made racist remarks and threw stones at the man.
"On the way home, a young man climbed onto the bus stop and began spitting at us.
When I told him to stop, he responded with apples and pears and then he uncovered his buttocks", another unpleasant experience was described by a mother of Slovak schoolchildren.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the Remainers went so far as to describe the conflicts with the immigrants as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above show that the atmosphere in British schools between the native inhabitants and the immigrants is beginning to become tense.
70 000 Slovaks who came to find work are registered in Britain.
And about 30,000 Slovak students are in British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it truly is an island of freedom.
Whatever you want from your vacation, it can be if you make the right choice.
Gold and white beaches like snow, high waves or calm sea like a pond.
Palm trees and all-inclusive with waiters offering you on the beach pizza, ice cream or even intoxicating cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you will find this list not only in its entirety, but enriched.
But there is only one island where you will find much more, and that is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of the Greater Antilles.
In the days of the Spanish, Cuba had been the stronghold of their invasion of America.
Christopher Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became the depot and transshipment point for the treasures that the Spanish had stolen and carried to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built in the early 1920's.
Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American mafia, had it built, since everything that was a crime in the USA (especially under prohibition) was allowed and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his clients were, among others,
I mean, Winston Churchill, and Ava Gardner, and Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, tall buildings have sprung up and cars, the cult symbols of the 1950s, have flown along the wide boulevards.
Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht.
The stars of show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can even sign your own autograph on the walls of the Havana Bodeguita.
In the bar of the Hotel Nacional, a luxury hotel, you will be served the cocktail of your choice.
And those cult cars are still running in Havana, because the jigoulis and the fiats that were imported have long since, in such a salty and humid climate, rotted.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is markedly outlined, nowhere else in the vicinity are there so many splendid colonial monuments as there are there.
Other places are getting more beautiful, like Trinidad.
Since tourism brings in money when needed, its development is given the green light.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have sprung up not only in Havana but especially in Varader, on the coast of Holguín province, and also on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba also offers a unique fantasy that will be appreciated by lovers of small trains.
The cane was brought back from the extensive plantations into the sugar mills on a narrow track by small steam and motor trains.
Their rolling stock has not been updated for decades, and so small locomotives can be seen in operation, the contemporaries of which are only in museums.
Where to go?
Most visitors do not miss the most famous places.
So there is no need to write long about Varadero or Havana.
And, of course, the Hemingway estate, mentioned earlier, is a museum that is a must-visit for any fan of the author.
The Viňales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque parts of Cuba.
Exuberant vegetation grows on the calcareous soil.
From the bottom of the valley, the ground is covered with mosses, limestone balloons, and rocks, and the fertile earth has taken hold of their entrails, even its rotten rocks are covered with a very dense vegetation.
The valley is probably the best place to grow Cuban tobacco.
You can see the final shape of this product by visiting one of the cigar factories in Havana.
One might also find it interesting that this is where the Chilean episode of Major Zeman was filmed.
The Republic of Trinidad
Ancient city founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
It was the slave trade and the sugar trade that brought him fame and wealth.
The wealth was embodied in the beauty and the showcase character of this small town.
The colonial Spanish architecture, strongly influenced by later French settlers, has remained almost unchanged for four centuries.
Trinidad, situated between the sea and the Escambray mountain range, is so remote that even in the 1950s there was no road linking the region to the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay out of the way.
They didn't build anything, and that's why they didn't demolish anything either, they just had a roof over their heads.
If you have more than an afternoon in Trinidad, then it is worth visiting some of the interesting places in the surrounding area, such as Playa Ancón or Sucre Valley.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la Música, which comes to life after sunset and where the music is only heard in the early morning.
The Barcoas
Some call this town in the far east of Cuba the most beautiful town on the island.
This view is certainly already influenced by the path that leads to it.
The two routes from Guantánamo to the island must cross high, rugged mountains and a landscape with almost no trace of human activity.
The UNESCO has included the Eastern Cove of Cuba, thanks to its intact landscape, in the list of World Heritage Sites.
The best chocolate is made there, in the church, there is the cross of Christopher Columbus (actually, it came into existence about a hundred years after Columbus's voyage) and from the hill where the old castle and the current El Castillo hotel stand, you can see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountain range, the Bay of Pigs and Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the shrine of Cuba's patron saint Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, the African religions practiced by the descendants of former slaves - all of these things could fill a whole book.
But, as they say, it's better to see once.
In Afghanistan, the allies are passive, says the Americans
The lack of soldiers and equipment is affecting the conduct of the mission in Afghanistan, according to the United States.
According to Defense Secretary Robert Gates, NATO should draw up a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going as it should, agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland, by representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country.
In addition to the growing opposition of the Taliban movement, the eight states involved are now also discussing future plans and coordination of alliances.
While the United States this week through Defense Secretary Robert Gates called for NATO troops to be more active, Britain sees as a priority the strengthening of the authority of the Afghan government and the intensification of development aid.
"The situation in Afghanistan is changing, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow the people to start a new development of the economy and security themselves", British Defence Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent of the
Afghan insurgent activity is, according to US military data, the most intense in the last five years.
Violent acts have increased by 27 percent compared to last year, up to 60 percent in the southern province of Helmand.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern part.
But according to the United States, the Allies have reached their absolute limit in both organization and equipment of troops.
In concrete terms, they are asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
"We will have to think seriously about the concrete objectives for the period ahead, as well as the ways in which we can achieve them", said Gates.
The NATO Secretary-General, Jaap de Hoop, made similar comments today.
"I'm not happy with what we have on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the troops and equipment we would need, and that is not enough", De Hoop told Reuters at the end of three days of talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months there have also been conflicts between the countries concerned over whether all the allies are really doing their best in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, has been criticized for its passivity.
"Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where the violence is minimal, so the combat requirements they are subject to are not as rigorous as those in the southern and eastern parts of the country where we operate", Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun this week called German soldiers lazy.
"Afghan idlers uncovered: the Germans play, while ours fight", Sun wrote in a document complete with pictures of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild has taken the counter-attack by publishing a photo of a British squad at a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
The national debt will rise to one trillion in 2009
The burden of a public debt of over 84,000 crowns lies on every Czech.
The total debt at the end of September was 842.7 billion.
The government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion kroner this year.
The Ministry reduced the amount planned to 152.8 billion kroner, as the state budget was more economical than expected.
The Czech Republic's public debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
In the nine months of this year it has therefore increased by 40.2 billion.
However, from June onwards, it fell by 13.4 billion kroner.
Today, the Ministry of Finance confirmed its data on the state debt as of the beginning of October.
The burden of a debt of over 84,000 crowns is on each Czech.
During the whole of last year, the state incurred over 111 billion crowns in debt.
"For the time being, it seems that, thanks to a smaller deficit planned for next year, we could exceed the one trillion crown limit in 2009 alone.
Next year, the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and 1 trillion crowns", Patria Finance analyst David Marek told iHNed.cz.
Next Finance analyst Vladimír Pikor has similar forecasts: "We could exceed a trillion in the course of 2009.
The exact date will depend on the next budget, which is not yet known.
If it appears that the political situation is changing, that politicians are ready to save more, the date could be postponed to 2010.
But I don't expect that change", he said.
Debts are rising
The national debt is the central government's debt and is essentially generated by the accumulation of deficits in the national budget.
The public debt is financed by treasury bonds, interest-rate securities, direct borrowings or, for example, by borrowings from the European Investment Bank.
The national debt has increased this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The external debt of the state has increased this year by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The negotiable government debt reached SEK 803.3 billion at the end of September and has decreased by SEK 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of the public debt was 6.5 years.
"The total debt has increased by 13 per cent year on year from the first to the third half of the year, which is, given the current good health of the economy, far too high a figure.
Interestingly, the increase was mainly driven by pension securities, where it reached 20 per cent.
It is bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand it indicates that there will be negotiating material when the pension reform comes", commented Pikora data.
Better than we expected
It follows from the strategy for financing and managing the state debt for the year 2007 that the government planned to borrow 159,2 billion kroner this year.
However, at the beginning of September, the Ministry reduced the amount planned to 152.8 billion kroner, thanks to better than expected savings in the State budget.
The sum is essentially the deficit of the state budget which will obviously reach 76 billion crowns this year, instead of the 91.3 billion crowns originally planned.
Secondly, there are the maximum resources foreseen for the Czech Consolidation Agency, i.e. CZK 13,3 billion, the reserve of CZK 10 billion for the payment of pensions, the financing of state pension securities for CZK 43 billion and the repayment of loans from the European Investment Bank amounting to CZK 1,8 billion.
She appeared in court today in Khartoum for naming a teddy bear after a man she had been with for years.
The British teacher on trial in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced on Thursday night by a Khartoum court to 15 days in jail and deportation, her lawyer said.
The Briton was accused of having let pupils aged 6 to 7 give the name of Muhammad to a teddy bear when any depiction of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
She was liable to be whipped.
The 54-year-old British teacher, who works at Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with insulting Islam and sedition under Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, following several complaints from parents of students to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually dates back to September, when the teacher asked her students, who were six or seven years old, to choose a name for the class's teddy bear.
"Eight names are coming out of the mouths of the children, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed", said school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 of the 23 children chose Mohamed as their favorite name.
Mohammed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but it's especially a very common first name in Sudan.
The children then made a book for the class with the picture of the bear followed by the caption "My name is Mohamed".
The bear itself did not carry any label with that name, but the problem is simply that the depiction of the prophet is considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said that he knew her well and that she would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, "I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name", and that it was just an "innocent mistake".
Many of her students shared her opinion, describing her as "very attentive to her students" and "never talking about religion in class".
The name Mohamed is also the second most common given name in Britain, spelled in 14 different ways.
This name is often chosen by Muslim families as a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules for using that first name?
Can we give it to a toy, for example?
This is of course a matter of interpretation.
They failed to reach an agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday, at the last round of negotiations in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
The Serbs and Albanians of Kosovo concluded a sixth and final session of talks in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, without overcoming their differences over the future status of the breakaway province.
It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the status, said European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger, at a press conference in Vienna.
Underlining that peace in the region was at stake, his US counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to honour their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
'There is no immediate violence planned but we are entering a very difficult period' he added, noting that 'clear tensions exist'.
End of mediation on 10 December
The troika of mediators from the European Union, the United States and Russia will make their final visits to Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, which is 90% Albanian-speaking, could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and last round of negotiations since the troika was given a new UN mediation mandate last August.
Americans and Europeans consider that their mediation will end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence to Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on continuing the negotiations beyond this deadline.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution", said Botsane-Khartchenko.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of UN administration of Kosovo, the West believes that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina said she was ready to unilaterally proclaim it if the Security Council did not decide in her favour.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy.
'Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached,' announced the president of the Autonomous Authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the Baden hotel where the 'last chance' negotiations were taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future premier of the province, expressed his regret.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "belongs to a past that has led to murders and deportations".
Domino effect
The Serbian President Boris Tadic said that a compromise was still possible, warning the Albanian majority in Kosovo of the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence for the province.
Belgrade said it feared a 'domino effect' in a region still weakened by the wars of independence in the 1990s.
'For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible.'
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision rests solely with the Security Council, where its Russian ally has a veto.
The Parliament of Kosovo will have the final say
'Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia', declared the Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
The negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they began: at the Security Council.
Fatmir Sedjiu told reporters that "the Parliament of Kosovo will have the final say on the status", adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking people would be "in consultation" with the Westerners.
Bush pulls an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President Bush announced at the opening of the international peace conference he was chairing in Annapolis, Maryland, on Tuesday that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He said that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately to find a final settlement to the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised to do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must dismantle "terrorist infrastructure" and Israel must end its settlement activities, said Bush, reminding both sides of their obligations under the "road map" for peace they agreed to in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority under Abbas's chairmanship would aim "to conclude a peace treaty resolving all outstanding issues, without exception, including the core issues".
This appellation covers the three thorny issues at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees driven from their homes in what is now the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the US president, Abbas insisted that the upcoming negotiations be "global and in-depth" and cover all aspects of a settlement, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, settlements, water, security, among others".
Speaking in turn, Olmert pledged that the talks would be "direct and continuous" and "an effort to conclude them in the course of 2008".
Bush set a deadline of the end of 2008 for the implementation of his "two-state vision" of Palestinian and Israeli coexistence.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had obtained a commitment to this from Bush before deciding to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is behind a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, that offers Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, particularly because it tackles the roots of the conflict and its central aspects", said Prince Saud in his interview with the Saudi-owned Arabic-language daily.
The prosecution says the cops are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always in this type of event, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What were the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the General Inspectorate of the National Police (IGPN), a police car was driving on Sunday, shortly after 5 pm, on Louise-Michel Street, in Villiers-le-Bel.
"It was not in intervention but in patrol, and was travelling at 40-50 km/h, without a gyrophare", explains a police source.
A green Kawazaki motorcycle, "not registered, therefore not allowed to drive on public roads" (see below) and driven by two young people without helmets, was "driving at a very fast speed".
"She hit the police car on her left, after a refusal of priority on the right", said a police officer.
The blood alcohol test on the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The condition of the car (before it was smashed, the windshield was torn, the bumper was torn off) testifies to the violence of the impact.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that she had entrusted an investigation into "facts of involuntary homicide and non-assistance to persons in danger" to the IGPN, in cooperation with the departmental directorate of public security of the Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor said that the investigation of the IGPN, at this stage, excluded the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses to the accident, heard on Sunday night, confirmed "the version of the police, that the mini-bike arrived relatively quickly on their left".
Yesterday, a sort of groove, probably caused by the friction of the footrests on the floor, showed that the two vehicles remained entangled until the police car managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of both victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday, a rumour quickly spread in Villiers-le-Bel, that the police had left the scene very quickly, thus not helping the two young people.
The IGPN, while remaining cautious, would also rule out 'any serious error' on this point.
"This is a more difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigations, and one that needs to be very careful about", said a police source.
Libération met with an eyewitness of those few moments following the accident.
One of her windows facing the stage.
"We went down with my cousin who is a nurse at the hospital to try to revive them", the witness said.
There was nothing to be done.
Then he saw a very bad-tempered policeman, limping.
Two others were trying to revive one of the youngsters, the fourth was talking on the phone.
In the face of the tension that soon surrounded the scene, and, apparently, the certainty that the people present had of the young people's hopeless situation, the police were taken by car by colleagues who arrived at the scene.
According to the witness, the rescue team arrived "about twenty minutes after the police left".
They also gave him cardiac massage, but it was in vain.
 I will not allow it to be said that the police services have not assisted the young people.
These kids were rescued.
The fire department got here right away.
Everything was done to try to save them", the prosecutor said.
Tensions are rising in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday put down the first protests since General Musharraf's imposition of a state of emergency two days earlier.
In the eastern city of Lahore, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against the emergency measures were injured by tear gas grenades used by the police, according to witnesses.
The latter responded by throwing stones, injuring some policemen.
At least 350 lawyers have been called in.
Scenarios similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, or police officers charging and injuring lawyers.
Several would have been arrested.
In Islamabad, lawyers from the Supreme Court Bar have called for a general strike and announced protests, following a wave of some 500 arrests over the weekend of opposition activists, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets leading to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the rally.
Other protests were reported to have taken place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (north-west).
The lawyers' movement on Monday received support from the religious parties grouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president 'urged the public to send flowers to the judges who ruled against the state of emergency and garbage to those who took the oath before Musharraf'.
'Musharraf's promise is no longer in place'
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the state of emergency declared Saturday night.
It was to decide in the next few days whether or not President Musharraf had been re-elected by indirect ballot on 6 October.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed and replaced.
'Everything we are seeing is illegal, unconstitutional and against the Supreme Court's rulings,' the judge told The News newspaper.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to step down from the military and become a civilian president 'no longer holds' after the imposition of the state of emergency, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to drop his military uniform by November 15, the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
The Pakistani government has also denied persistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf was placed under house arrest by his deputy army chief.
More than a third of pregnancies remain unplanned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) and unplanned or unforeseen births.
Even today, more than one in three pregnancies (36%) is unintended, according to a study by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), 40 years after the Neuwirth law was passed, which liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) and unplanned or unforeseen births.
The various methods of contraception such as the pill or the IUD still have a failure rate of 5 to 6%, according to INED.
The liberalization of contraception has nevertheless led to better "fertility control", according to the institute, which notes that the rate of pill use among women aged 20 to 44 has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
And eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
In fact, it is calculated monthly for one in five couples and, if possible, in spring, the season considered to be the most pleasant for having a child.
Spectacular repairs on the space station
It took astronaut Scott Parazynski and his fellow crew members in space more than seven hours to perform the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel, vital to the scientific activities of the International Space Station (ISS).
A risky outing that has accumulated records for its duration, its distance from habitable modules, the speed with which it was imagined, the tools  made  by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem emerged on Tuesday as astronauts unloaded the Harmony module from the Discovery shuttle, a large cylindrical piece that will soon house the European and Japanese science labs (see box).
This module is a kind of docking dock for the laboratory modules.
But we have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was to move a 17.5-ton solar panel power module already on the ISS to its final position.
After moving it, the crew began the redeployment of the module's solar panels, which have a wingspan of 250 feet.
And that's when one of the panels, which folds out like accordions, was damaged by a cable that got stuck about a foot long.
The deployment was stopped to avoid further damage to the panel.
The astronauts, originally scheduled to perform a control mission of the shuttle Discovery and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to focus on the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go to the end of the 30 meter long remote controlled arm of the shuttle added to the station to perform the repair.
He is one of NASA's top spacewalkers.
He's tall, tough, very nimble, has a very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this trainee doctor was therefore charged with operating on the injured solar panel.
After inspecting the damage, he cut the faulty wire and installed some sort of "plugs" on the damaged area.
He was assisted by a second  spacewalker  who remained near the airlock and, from inside, by the other astronauts including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick wrapped in insulation to avoid electrocution on the solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and  tinkered  by the astronauts aboard the station.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to fully deploy before taking inventory of his tools and returning to the station interior.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts were enjoying a half-day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts return to the shuttle Discovery for a return to Earth scheduled for Wednesday.
The EADS security is listed on the stock exchange
EADS shares are currently down sharply on the Paris stock exchange after the aerospace and defense group announced that it would have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to deal with the A400M delays.
EADS is down 4% at 21.96 euros on the Paris stock exchange.
The group was forced to revise its operating profit forecast for 2007 following delays caused by the slow progress in the development of the A400M engine, which is a prerequisite for the aircraft's maiden flight.
The cost of overcoming the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft, announced in October, is estimated at 'between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than 1 billion for Airbus', announced the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
The Commission's proposal to extend the scope of the aid to the coal industry is based on the fact that the coal industry is a major producer of coal, which is the main source of the coal industry's production.
The group also states that the estimate of new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
It should be noted that EADS' operating profit fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to charges linked to delays in another programme, the A380 ultra-large aircraft.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French Army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
There will be no suspense on Sunday, when the ballots are cast: Russians will massively vote for President Putin's party, United Russia.
Confirming their desire for stability, even authoritarianism, after a very tight campaign.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today addressed a televised message to voters on public channels, which has already been recorded but whose content is kept secret.
He is doing so as the leader of United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is expected to be overwhelming.
The President showed no sign of this yesterday when he received the foreign ambassadors, merely making a fresh charge against the West for meddling - his favorite theme during the campaign.
 We know the price of true democracy and want the fairest, most transparent and open elections, elections without any cheating,  he added.
The opposition thinks we're far from the answer.
It denounces a campaign tainted by pressure.
Communist leader Gennadi Ziuganov says that there have never been such dirty elections, even in Yeltsin's time.
After the crackdown on protests last weekend, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, who was sentenced to five days in prison for illegal protest, remains banned from visiting according to his lawyer.
 The Russians have kept the mentality of homo sovieticus 
Behind these uneventful legislative proposals are two much more open questions:
- Who will succeed Putin as president?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; the candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive term.
But no successor emerged.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Leader of the parliamentary majority and all-powerful United Russia party who chooses the government and the president?
In any case, in the legislative and presidential elections, the incumbent will triumph.
It's a tradition.
 Russians have retained the mentality of homo sovieticus, they do not feel in control of their own destiny , says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent Levada Centre.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University goes further: civil society in this Christianised country was five centuries behind Europe; the famous communitarian spirit delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s,  Putin returned to the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population, especially since this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by a certain economic ease,  says Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today Russians  are voluntarily renouncing the  personal responsibility that they briefly displayed after the collapse of the USSR.
What's there to think about?
The phenomenon affects all layers of society, including the business world.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of United Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The public prefers stability.
In the name of which the Russians will not vote for the extremists either.
Conclusion by Tamara Tcherednitchenko, 54 years old teacher:  What is the value of thinking?
Those in power aren't too bad, why change them? 
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of secrecy, the Nazi archives in Bad Arolsen, which trace the fate of 17.5 million victims of Hitler's regime, are now open to the public.
The 47 million archival documents, stored on 27 km of linear in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were previously only available for consultation for humanitarian purposes, i.e. individually and by name, at the request of a former victim or his heirs.
The 11 states in charge of their management - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
The ratification process of this agreement by all the States having been completed, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow for research including on the movements of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health status of forced labourers, explains Reto Meistern, the director of the archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, opposed the opening of these nominative documents to the public, because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some of the deportation victims.
The records of concentration camps and Gestapo arrest warrants were collected after the war for a practical purpose: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labor and, if necessary, to provide them with proof of their internment, so as to open the way for their compensation.
Even today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen process tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for some of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
 There is nothing fundamentally new to be expected from these documents, said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Research Centre on Anti-Semitism at the Technische Universität Berlin in 2006.
EU and India to reach free trade agreement in 2008
At present, bilateral trade between India and Europe is already worth nearly EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India's largest trading partner, accounting for 18% of its external trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
EU foreign ministers gave the European Commission the go-ahead last April to start negotiations for free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India's largest trading partner, accounting for 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also its largest foreign investor, but India is only the EU's 9th largest trading partner, according to European Commission figures.
"A free trade agreement will greatly boost both economies" and "India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans", said Mr Mandelson.
The European Commissioner said that Europe is the first or second market for each of India's top ten export products.The Asian and European giants trade annually for "€47 billion in goods" and for "€10 billion in services", said European Commission delegation head Danièle Smadja in New Delhi this week, lamenting that bilateral trade has "not yet reached its full potential".The EU and India will meet Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England is responding to the concerns by offering 10 billion pounds over five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday expressed concern to alleviate the current return of concerns about credit conditions and announced an unusually long offer of ten billion pounds at the base rate of 5.75% over five weeks.
"To alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty about how they will manage their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its planned reserve requirements during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in a five-week open market operation", it said in a statement.
The bank states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put on the market on 6 December at 12:15 GMT, at the base rate, until 10 January.
This appears to be the first time the BoE has marketed five-week liquidity in an open market operation.
These are normally done every one week.
The BoE added in its statement that it "stands ready to take further action to keep the rates" of overnight interbank lending in line with its base rate.
The overnight interbank rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month rate was 6.6%, the highest since September 18.
Since the summer financial crisis began, the Bank of England's money market had been hit with a high penalty rate, which had deterred banks from using it.
Some rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the pound against the euro, suggested that many had preferred to subscribe to the amounts put on the market by the European Central Bank, at more advantageous rates and with more assured discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to examine PS proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and New Centre groups on Thursday refused to discuss the articles of the Socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
The text, which was drafted in a socialist "niche" (a meeting at the initiative of a parliamentary group), rejected a dozen or so measures adopted on Tuesday by the PS national bureau, including a 50% increase in the employment premium, the reintroduction of the floating TIPP, a transport check or the setting of rents.
The UMP and NC voted against the articles (180 votes against 115), and the sitting was adjourned after the general debate, which had led to an exchange of views, sometimes heated, between the majority and the opposition within hours of Nicolas Sarkozy's televised speech on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS group announced that his group would be presenting all its proposals in the form of amendments to the amending finance bill to be considered by the Assembly next week.
A new festival is born
Following numerous rumors about C3 Presents creating a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announced the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with Festival Republic by British producer Melvin Benn.
"For our company, it's an honor to work with someone who has inspired the current festival movement in America", Charlie Jones of C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping.
The festival is scheduled to be held August 8-10 on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes outside of Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, Festival Republic director Melvin Benn is one of the world's most respected festival producers.
In 1989 he took the helm of the Reading Festival in the UK, which attracts some 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio and in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also taken on production, licensing and organisational duties for the Glastonbury Festival, which now holds up to 177,500 people.
Calling Glastonbury 'the most inspiring event' he has ever attended, C3's Charlie Jones says his company and Melvin Benn's are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
"We had chosen Philadelphia as the market and were working hard with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia", says Charlie Jones.
We were in talks with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have become entangled in political ills because of the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
 Fortunately, we were able to have a chat with Melvin Benn and we are getting ready to create a great festival on a unique site that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia.
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Chicago's Grant Park, after having made their mark on the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The two events recorded gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M respectively in 2007.
Both of these festivals are held in urban settings.
'Melvin Benn's European model is a country festival, whereas ours is more of an urban green space' says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge the two formulas in some way, to give both a European-style rural festival and an urban-style American festival.
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Vineland community, including the mayor, is enthusiastically supporting the event", says Charlie Jones.
The latter refused to disclose the terms of the agreement, but said that they were "interesting enough to invest in such an event and to host a festival that hopefully will have a long life".
Charlie Jones says the capacity of this festival is "very big", like the 80,000-person capacity of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He said that invitations had been issued to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed at the time of going to press.
"Vineland will be rock-flavored, but the music will be varied, in hopes of attracting all kinds of spectators", says Charlie Jones.
His partners on C3, which received the Top Independent Promoter award from the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal is facing the Terminator.
It's not easy to attract Hollywood film sets to Montreal when no one but Terminator is against it...
This seduction mission is part of the delegate's duties.
A politically difficult term because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces runaway productions.
Is it hard to play the Governor?
The industry decides where it goes.
If she thinks the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she'll go.
Our role is to offer the ones they will consider the best ones, he says.
The race to the festivals
For the moment, however, Denis Turcotte's priority is to promote the local cinema.
The Oscar race is on.
It will be from all the festivals on the West Coast, whether it is Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it is a question of presenting the Quebec films, showcasing them and ensuring that the directors do interviews.
The Dark Ages had a great showing at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is playing in Santa Monica and will be shown at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also submitted four feature films and four short films to the American Film Institute Fest this month.
The experts are divided over the subprime crisis.
With less than five weeks to go until the end of the fiscal year, investors are already rubbing their hands in anticipation of the traditional end-of-year rally.
However, this year experts are not so sure that it will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December in the stock market generally has a positive behavior.
However, forecasts should not be based exclusively on statistics, as uncertainties are lurking in the markets, at least in the short term, given the current context".
Although they do not favour a stock market boom in the last weeks of the year, they point out that "the stock market is fuelled by the existence of liquidity, which is willing to invest in the absence of guaranteed alternatives, especially fixed income, which is affected by the flight to quality assets in both the long and short term".
They believe that the stock market will be more or less sideways, not free from volatility, "especially because the impact of the Fed's likely rate cut is unknown, given the high level of crude oil and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions".
Javier Barrio, BPI's sales manager in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say that there will be a rally.
"It's not the best thing", the expert assures.
The Spanish stock market index, the Ibex, has lost almost 4% since 8 November when it closed at 15.945,7 points.
However, not all experts have this negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points thanks to the reorganization of portfolios and the traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year during these dates.
However, the expert said that things will be a bit different this year as he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the bridge of the Constitution Day (December 6).
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, said that we are close to the technical levels and "therefore we could see a rebound in the index which could be triggered by the information coming from the European Union regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst hopes that these will be positive.
The analysts agree on the values that will be responsible for driving the Ibex to new highs.
Solana, from Intermoney, says that "the big values are back for him this year".
The expert would include in the portfolio the two major banks and some manufacturers "because when the date approaches, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
Federico Olucha, from Inversis Banco, said that the increases will be due to the banking and industrial sector.
The women constructors will also benefit from this rally, if they take part.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other manufacturers such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path", the expert explains.
Cyclical consumption will be the main driver in the latter part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology companies will also do very well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, only on two occasions has December been a bearish month.
The real end-of-year rally was in 2003, when the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the bursting of the tech bubble.
This year, the Ibex 35 has recovered 28.17%, while December recorded a rise of 6.68%.
It remains to be seen whether 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of gains (for the time being the Ibex has risen by 8.36% since January) and whether it succeeds in computering on its year-end rally.
The People's Bank will open 200 offices open 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
The People's Bank has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
In total, 200 of these banks are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the brand name Populaire Max, represent a great change for the bank.
The same applies to the rest of the Spanish agencies, since they are the first group to have decided to start betting on the uninterrupted opening of their branches until 8.30 p.m. and to open on Saturdays from 10.00 a.m. to 8.30 p.m.
Another group which has also repeatedly stated that it would like to increase the opening hours of its branches, BBVA, although it has not yet decided to take the first step.
He's about to make a deal with the unions to close 75% of his branches on Saturdays instead of opening one afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the experience of the Banque Populaire will be decisive for whether other organizations will join this initiative, which coincides with the business hours.
This is precisely the objective pursued by the People's Bank.
Attract self-employed customers who move around these areas to shop at the SMEs and shops on the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 branches spread throughout Spain in about 18 months, since it is not about opening new branches but about renovating the existing ones.
To this end, the organisation will modernise the branches it already has in the commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of customers on the different streets.
In this way, the extension of the hours is accompanied by a different design of the interior of the branch and a new, more modern design with brighter colors.
The commercial manager of the bank, Ángel Rivera, assures that this renovation does not involve large investments, but the hiring of personnel, since the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
The agencies, which will also have spaces for SMEs to meet, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The Banco Popular has already tested its initiative in three Madrid branches.
And the experience was positive, as Ángel Rivero explains.
The branches of Murillo Brave, O'Donnell and Gran Vía in Madrid are the streets that have been chosen, and apparently successfully, according to Rivero.
The People's Bank currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others that operate under the Mundocredit brand, specialized in the case of immigrants, also with very long hours, which are open even on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax agencies they will not copy the BBVA model, where several of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our customers,' says Rivero.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco doubles the market value of its rival Antena 3 for the first time
We got there.
With this sentence Paolo Vasile, a delegated adviser of Telecinco, was expressing his satisfaction yesterday, at the close of the stock market, when he found that the chain he ran doubled the value of its rival, Antena 3.
One thing clouded his joy: 'What hurts me is not that we have increased but that we have decreased,' he said.
However, he stressed that in a weak market, "we have fallen less".
Telecinco ended yesterday with a 2.54 percent increase.
This gain stabilizes its loss at 15.66% for the year.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (with an additional 13%) thus reached 4,488.88 million euros, according to data from Bloomberg.
Its rival Antena 3, which lost 1.52% yesterday and has accumulated a 40.5% decline since January, costs half, 2.193.46 million.
The value of the other communication companies listed on the stock exchange amounts to 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518,53 million in that of Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días) and 1.779 million in that of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenne 3 is due to the fact that 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are able to do, in the same market, at what price and how we make it profitable in terms of audience.
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first TV channel to exceed 1,000 million in gross advertising revenue this year, as assured by Giuseppe Tringali, the delegated advisor of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the group's advertising.
For this figure to be true, the TV channel should record a 3.6% increase in its advertising bill for the current fiscal year compared to the 965.4 million in the 2006 fiscal year.
Net receipts from Antenne 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (to 734.4 million) while net television revenues increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to for the better relative evolution of Telecinco on the Stock Exchange is the important pay out that it has maintained until now: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit between its shareholders.
Vasile assures that, although it is early to make a decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
'We have the official compromise of giving a minimum of 50%, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, those to whom we have already given shares with the 33% of Endemol.
Analysts say the market is showing signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates for Telecinco in 2008 to 4% and in 2009 to 7%.
This is due, they explain, to the drop in projected revenue growth from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company reduced the forecast of the gains of Antenne 3 to 4,5% in 2008 and to 7,5% in 2009.
3 opinions
1. The
Ibersecurities recommends buying both securities based on their high dividend yield and long-term sustainability potential.
2. The
La Caja Madrid sees Telecinco (accumulating) as better than Antenne 3 (maintaining) for the 'multiple attractions' and the increase in business.
3. the
JPMorgan: He recommends looking at both cases because he has had 'similar threats' (a saturated market and a bad economic climate).
Congress approves the transposition of the MiFID, which came into force on 1 November
Alongside its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the congressional vote on the amendments incorporated into the bill in the Senate, the Government submitted to a public hearing the regulations that will develop the new law, with the aim of its entry into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by the Members of Parliament and the Senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulation to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the activity of the agencies so that the markets function efficiently.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, involves the modernisation of financial markets, at the time it strengthens investor protection, improves the powers of the leaders of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promote cooperation between the various leaders of the European Union.
The new regulation will allow financial advisory services to be provided to both specialised social reasons and natural or legal persons and creates a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial advisory companies (AFI), which merge securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
It also increases the number of systems for executing transactions in financial instruments, so that it is possible to add multilateral trading systems and orders internationalisation systems, which compete with the current stock exchange managers, to the regulated secondary markets.
The Act also requires investment firms to disclose to the market information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management practices and requires them to keep a register of all transactions carried out by them, in order to facilitate the control by the CNMV.
Through the Congressional Committee on Economic Affairs, several amendments were added, including one that emphasizes that secured debt will be considered a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which was demonstrated with what happened with the debt of high risk American mortgages (subprime).
In addition, they took advantage of the transposition of the management took advantage to legally delimit the functions that graduates in Economics can have 30 years after in 1977 was approved, the Royal Decree which delimits the professional functions reserved for economists.
The Senate also incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as the Ombudsman, who will work on behalf of a company, who will not require authorisation from the CNMV and who will be able to lend his services of marketing products and attracting new customers to different investment companies at the same time.
The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices rises by five tenths in November to 4.1%.
This indicator, which is then used by Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides an overview of the price developments in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication is in line with the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same method as that used for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not yet available at the time of publication.
LINE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, because it does not necessarily have to coincide with the final data that will be revealed on December 14.
"CPI will continue at relatively high levels"
Second Vice-President and Minister of Economy Pedro Solbes said that the 4.1% increase in the November CPI is a "time figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes made it clear in the halls of Congress that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential with regard to monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government was not facing such a high increase.
"We were hoping for a figure of around 4 per cent", the Economy Minister acknowledged in relation to the figure announced today.
Virgin is looking to recoup 42 billion euros over three years with Northern Rock.
Northern Rock's deposits have fallen by more than 50% to £12 billion (€16,800 million) since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to a rescue loan from the Bank of England.
At the time he was amassing some record deposits over £25 million, a figure which has gradually fallen over the last two and a half months because of the distrust of his clients and despite the 100% guarantee of this money that the Government has offered and will keep until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rename the organisation with its financial trading brand Virgin Money, needs to seize around a quarter of the income from UK banks that will be deposited over the next three years to get the remaining £18 billion until the £30 billion target is reached.
The group of tycoon Richard Branson, known for its screaming advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week named the Virgin Partnership's offering, which includes three other companies, including its favorite to save it from bankruptcy.
Totana mayor was arrested for an alleged urban corruption plot
The Civil Guard arrested the current mayor of the municipality of Totana (of the Popular Party) because of his alleged connection with the urban corruption plot discovered this week.
AIn addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the municipal police chief were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced last May Juan Morales, current right-wing MP, and until then municipal councilor of the town hall, and who according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Channel, could be the 'leader' of this plot.
Officers are continuing to search the city hall and the city council premises and we do not rule out the possibility of further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the urban corruption scheme, discovered earlier this week, has been charged.
As the SER Channel reported yesterday, the lawyer of the 'popular party' deputy Juan Morales was arrested as he left Morales' home with important documentation in his possession related to the plot.
Moreover, according to sources of the investigation, the subject of the investigation is the alleged cashing of Morales's commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a construction company in Galicia to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At this time, there are eight people in custody.
Bono agrees to head the Spanish Socialist Party's candidacy for Toledo and to preside over the Congress if they win the elections
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to head the Spanish Socialist Party list for Toledo for the next general elections and to be President of the Congress in case the Socialists win the general elections.
The Secretary of Organization of the Spanish Socialist Party, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced this during a press conference after the meeting that took place this afternoon at the federal headquarters of the party with Zapatero.
The Chief Executive justified the offer to the former minister because "it is important to rely on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
He also stressed that it "seems" that the politician from La Mancha will be the candidate of the Socialist group who will preside over the Congress if the Socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as president of the Congress, who on November 15 announced his decision not to run in the next general elections and to give up his political career to devote himself to the fight against climate change in the university setting.
The former minister acknowledged that the Prime Minister has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he abandoned him two years ago.
He also noted that although citizens already know who will be the economic vice-president if the Spanish Socialist Party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce who will chair the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he wins the job, Bono hopes to transform the House into "a house of respect, not of abuse or screaming" and make it "more and more like the citizens".
"Sometimes it seems unfortunate that the only place in Madrid where one cannot speak quietly and calmly is the Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate has on some occasions been interrupted 26 times".
Similarly, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his know-how" and he did not want to pretend that he was already in office so as not to fall, as he pointed out, into what his opponents could consider "a domination".
The climate is a propaganda
Since the climate change movement is subjecting to relentless persecution both those who are skeptical of its predictions and those who prioritize other political and social battles, it must demonstrate an iron consistency.
This is all the more true for a leader of the movement who is President of the Government like Zapatero and who believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and who even proposes to sign a "new contract for the planet".
This approach obliges him to explain why the action, or inaction, of his Government has contributed decisively to Spain's leading the European Union in the non-implementation of the Kyoto Protocols.
Who are the perpetrators of the non-execution, in which sectors did it occur and why did its government, the one that signed the contract with the planet, not prevent it?
In addition, he must make it clear to the Spanish people what measures he is going to take to curb climate change.
What businesses will be affected, what habits of citizens will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings will be forced upon us, what economic consequences will this have.
I mean, who's going to sacrifice and who's going to pay to save the planet.
But there was no explanation and there will be no explanation.
Because it's about sacrifice and paying.
The measures against climate change, the real measures, are unpopular.
Costly, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of businesses and individuals.
The essence of the proposal put forward by the Spanish Socialist Party seemed so dangerous to Zapatero that he was quick to deny it.
In other words, it is a matter of saving the planet with nothing, only propaganda, with slogans that have no real consequences.
With phrases that have an impact, commissions, committees, protocols, new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for the election campaigns who does not speak, who does not denounce and who does not demand, beautifies the meetings and inspires tenderness.
I hope that this is only a purely virtual contracting party and that it does not require us to ride a bicycle or to cool off with a fan.
The mayor and the local police chief of Totana arrested for an alleged plot of urban corruption
The Spanish gendarmerie arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the local police chief, the town clerk and a hotel contractor suspected of possible urban crimes, sources informed today of the investigation.
The municipal councillor was arrested at his home and taken to the town hall, where at this moment many agents were gathered, who also presented themselves to the Municipal Councillor's Office of Urban Planning and the Municipal Enterprise for Industrial Land and Housing Management.
These three judgments are in addition to the six judgments handed down last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation to reclassify more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land for urbanisation so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 homes, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other people were not arrested but are charged in the judicial investigation, which is being conducted by the Court No. 1 of Totana.
The first six detainees were placed in judicial custody today.
According to the sources, the former Totana city councilor and current autonomous parliamentarian of the PP party, Juan Morales, is targeted by the investigation.
In addition, the ex-wife, owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, was charged, as well as the current fiancée of the former municipal councillor, who resides in Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and entrepreneur from Vigo (Galicia) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, an agency of the Nuaria Group, through which the bribes were allegedly made.
The investigation is being carried out by the Urban Crime Unit of the Central Operative Unit (UCO) of the gendarmerie, whose officers, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven inspections, the majority of which were carried out in businesses related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
So only one person was arrested in Totana, the owner of a well-known poultry business in the area, who could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 housing units, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company has acquired 2.2 million square metres of land in Totana which has been redeveloped and its project is expected to double the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which deal with property development; Conycase, which manages the car parks of Vigo in the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and Fernando el Católico Square; Hogartel, which deals with direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with yesterday's commentary in Finland's most important newspaper (indeed the head of PISA information on the educational level in the world), Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that Blackburn's book review, curiously, appeared there:
"The content of the Philosophy course has challenged public opinion as a consequence of the Jokela school tragedy.
The culprit of the deaths, a baccalaureate student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Councillor in charge of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato on what is written in the pages of the daily newspaper Helsingin Sanomat and he claimed that studying Nietzsche is not indispensable in the basic compulsory course of Philosophy in high schools".

A colleague shares information about the introduction of Internet downloading crimes in the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading a song would be a criminal offense punishable by six months to a year in prison.
On the other hand, the theft of CDs from a store for less than 400 euros is considered only as a fault (Article 623.1).
B. Theft from a store for a value of up to 1,000 euros is already considered a crime, but the penalty is lower than that imposed for downloading (Article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is less than the one imposed for downloading (a Section 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the traffic of compact discs.
Participation in a riot involves a sentence of three months to one year (Article 154 of the Penal Code) and trafficking in CDs would involve a sentence of six months to two years.
(Article 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a movie, according to Article 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted films without the authorization of the authors is punished more than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).
Finally, if my colleague is right, then someone is exaggerating.

My doctor told me about one of his articles on strange research entitled 'Money produces brain activation, especially if others receive less.'
That is, the sentiment generated by the monthly wage of the workers depends on what the colleagues earn.
The study was carried out using magnetic resonance tomography at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the neurocognitive imaging group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany, "the strongest activation occurred when the participant answered correctly and his partner failed".
The researchers found that when both people guessed that they were getting the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one of them got twice as much, the activation was greater.
I'm not sure that conclusion requires that much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
For the past eight years, Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly prosecuting Balkan war criminals from the office of the Prosecutor of the Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, which sits in The Hague.
Her term ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with a bitter taste, because the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica murder - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died - ex-general Ratko Mladic and ex-Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are on this list from which the documentary by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach takes its title, 'La lista de Carla' (2006, not exclusively shown in Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, which follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York who pursues fugitive criminals and pressures the governments involved to narrow the circle.
What kind of insurance is right for me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the event of an accident, is a considerable expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, length of driving licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured, and use, among others.
Having a car is the main thing.
The choice of the right car insurance is even more difficult than the choice of the vehicle model.
And it's that choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the model of the vehicle.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is embodied in an insurance contract, which states that the company receives the value of the premium awarded and in exchange becomes liable for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a loss.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is determined by various factors, such as age, sex, length of driving licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or use of the vehicle, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices according to statistics, so that the higher the probability of an accident, the higher the odds.
For this reason, people over 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, since statistics show that these people have a lower rate of claims due to their prudence.
Similarly, using surveys, the companies concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will influence the frequency and therefore the likelihood of an accident.
The higher the frequency, the higher the odds.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
This is why the driver must study the situation carefully to choose the car insurance that best suits his profile.
We will discuss the most significant variables when choosing one or the other type of insurance, so that it not only adapts to the insurer's characteristics but also offers a reasonable price.
Young people under 25 face various disadvantages when taking out insurance at an affordable price, such as low driving experience and a long-standing driving licence.
Although the ideal way to get a good insurance policy is to buy a life insurance policy that covers all risks, there are other, more economical options.
The more farsighted drivers can opt for all-risk insurance with a sense of openness, so that they can get the coverage of all-risk insurance at a more affordable price.
This form of agreement implies that the customer pays part of the amount of the claim.
"The part of the amount of the loss that the customer pays will be determined according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount", says Luis Noguera, the head of First Europa in Spain, an online insurance broker.
Another option is extended third party insurance, so that the customer has protection against damage caused to third parties, but not for damage caused to his own car.
In addition, it would be insured against theft, fire, and loss of the vehicle.
A word of advice.
If you are under 25 years old try to be cautious and avoid claims as much as possible, as this will affect the premium, which may reduce the price of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the company's basic rate.
Instead, a penalty is an increase in the basic rate.
"The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and its profits.
If the company has had a good year it can afford to increase bonuses", Noguera said.
After the age of 25 it becomes easier for drivers to sign an insurance contract, since the accident rate is reduced by the experience gained.
For this reason it is better to choose a full-risk insurance policy with a clear understanding of the risks involved.
"Normally young people cannot benefit from the experience acquired after an accident", says the director of the European company in Spain, adding that most accidents occur during the second year of driving, after the 'fear of the novice' has passed.
However, if the client is married but has no children yet, it is preferable to negotiate a comprehensive insurance, as long as his financial situation allows it.
Child marriages are considered by insurers to be the ones with the lowest claims rate, because the premiums will be lower.
In this case the best insurance would be a full risk insurance with a deductible (which could be 300 euros), or an extended third party insurance from the third year of the vehicle's life when the insured has a high level of premium.
"They have a more relaxed attitude and they have a greater purchasing power to afford the luxury of taking on a larger amount of franchisees", says Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, a full risk insurance with a deductible is preferable (they are 150 euros), or an extended third-party insurance when the insurer has a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the event of accidents, but also because it represents a significant expense, which is why it is essential to study properly the insurance that is most suitable for us according to our personal situation.
Celtic will try to win a point in Milan to reach the last eight
AC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will face each other next Tuesday at San Siro in search of the point they are missing to achieve their respective goals in the closing round of the Champions League, since it serves the Italians to be first and the Scots to qualify.
The Italians have 10 points and have already qualified on the fifth day with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow have nine points, but they still need another point to ensure that Shakhtar Donetsk, who have six, and Benfica, who have four, do not pass them.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the end of the sixth day, as AC Milan will play the Club World Cup semi-finals in Japan on the 13th of this month in search of a place in the final on 16 December.
This group will remain closed before the draw at the Giuseppe Meazza Stadium seems to be the most expected result, although both teams will try to come out victorious, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic Glasgow knows that by winning it would remain first and ensure a better crossing in the last eight.
A defeat by Gordon Strachan's team could be enough to qualify if Shakhtar Donetsk doesn't win, but it won't be enough to count on that as the game is now nine points behind the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanese will try to poison the evening to the Scots, who have good hopes of qualifying for the last eight for the second time in the Champions League, after being beaten during the last edition by a goal from Kaka during the prolongations (1-0).
In the meantime, the victory would be for Shakhtar, in case Celtic lost, to qualify for the last 16 to continue the UEFA Champions League.
And it is that Benfica, although they are last and without any possibility of continuing European competition, could reach third place with a victory.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls' tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls kicked off their first tour since the group disbanded in 2000 in front of an estimated 20,000 spectators in Vancouver, Canada.
Posh Spice (Victoria Beckham), Scary Spice (Melanie Brown), Baby Spice (Emma Bunton), Sporty Spice (Melanie Chisholm) and Ginger Spice (Geri Halliwell) said shortly before their show at Vancouver's GM Place Stadium began that the band's reunion was "brilliant".
Around 20,000 people sold out their tickets to the concert, which was the subject of a video that tells the story of the band that made headlines in the late 1990s.
The meeting and world tour coincided with the release of a new album that included their major hits and two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which EMI released in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls took to the stage to show off the bracelets that Posh Spice's husband, British footballer David Beckham, had given them.
The athlete was in the crowd that filled GM Place, even though Victoria had banned him from it a few days earlier.
Before the show started, Victoria Beckham remarked that the British footballer "hasn't seen our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's going to think of the show".
'Sporty Spice' who left the band in 1998 "because of differences between us" and who caused the band to disband two years later, also expressed his nervousness during an interview with the press, two hours before the show started.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous, but I saw that people's feelings had changed, the feelings for the Spice Girls had changed.
And I thought why not, I'm glad I made a decision" said Chisholm about the group meeting she disbanded nine years ago.
The singer also noted that with time "things have settled down and we have a lot of appreciation for each other".
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed in 1998.
First, according to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines flight.
When they arrived at the airport, an army of baby-sitters were waiting for them.
She has five sons and seven daughters.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will perform in California (USA), San Jose (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
In Madrid they will be on display on December 23.
The new gas deal between Russia and Ukraine is a wake-up call.
A dispute over gas prices is raging between Ukraine and Russia, increasing the risk of a spillover on fuel exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are transported by pipeline, and each pipeline is closely monitored.
Kiev has announced that if Russia raises the cost of fuel, it will increase transit fees to Russia.
Last year, a clash between the two caused a drop in supplies to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, Russia's gas monopoly, tried in vain to reach an agreement on the cost of Russian gas supplied to Ukraine in 2008.
Gazprom said it would increase its prices to Ukraine as planned, given that it agreed to pay for 2008 up to 50% more for the supply of gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts said that this would result in Ukraine having to pay 40% more for imports from Gazprom.
 It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the talks, remembering that we are a country through which most of the gas is transiting,  Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinkh told Reuters news agency.
 The fluctuations in gas costs are probably related to our discussions about transit fees (to Western Europe) via Ukraine 
The last major altercation between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006 caused the interruption of Gazprom's supplies to Ukraine.
This has led to a fall in exports to Western Europe, and consequently to higher prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union's gas supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves, although most of them are still undeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Union nations in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health 'must monitor its foreign employees'.
The Scottish Health Department needs to improve its checks on its non-EU employees to check whether they have a criminal record, the audit committee said.
The warning by the Auditor General, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was implicated in the Glasgow airport attack in June.
Mr Black also expressed concern that the Scottish Health Office had no precise figures on the number of overseas people employed.
The report nevertheless highlighted other decisive checks, which were carried out correctly on a sample of employees of five health authorities.
The auditor general did checks on extra-community staff following the Glasgow airport attack.
Bilal Addullah, 28, an Iraqi-born doctor working at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after he drove his jeep through the main terminal doors.
He was one of three doctors who were filmed at the Old Bailey in October, suspected of being involved in various attempted car bombings in the UK.
The Department of Health will have to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas staff to be sure of the validity of their qualifications, experience and work permits for the UK.
Although the Scottish Health Service uses the Scottish Disclosure to carry out criminal background checks, the agency has no right to obtain such information outside of Great Britain.
Among the many warnings, the Auditor General's report now states that committees are required to confront the Office of Criminal Records, thus allowing employers to undertake audits on various countries.
 Although we have found that some information about the staff has been verified, this is not always done.  The report states.
Mr Black said that the Scottish Health Service carried out most of the pre-employment checks it would carry out itself, but he also said: 'Our report highlights areas where the system can be improved to ensure that adequate information on certain overseas staff is available to the health services.
Mr Peter Terry, President of BMA Scotland, said it was 'extremely unlikely' that pre-employment checks could identify employees likely to commit future terrorist acts.
He said "the report suggests that the current pre-employment checks are working well in the Scottish health system and it is not certain that these warnings can add any value".
The Scottish Health Service reported employing 1,161 people from overseas, mostly doctors and nurses.
But the Auditor-General has stressed that these figures must certainly be revised upwards, partly because of the problems of identifying staff with indefinite contracts, who may or may not choose to remain in our country.
The survey showed that the current health inspection procedures in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are fully adequate.
These checks are carried out on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policy and pre-employment control system for overseas health service staff.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was excited to be doing this work in the wake of the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport. 
She added that the Scottish Government and the Health Committee would consider carefully the warnings in the report due to be published next month and would commit to ensuring that the recently updated pre-employment checks applied to all employees, including overseas workers, were better enforced.
Joy Division is dominating the Oscars.
Control, the biopic about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curts, won five awards, including Best Film, at the British Independent Film Awards.
Trophies were also awarded to star Sam Riley, who worked in a store until he was hired to play Curtis in this film directed by Anton Corbijn and co-starring Toby Kebbell.
Judi Dench was named best actress for her role in the thriller "Notes on a Scandal"
Daniel Craig, the Bond star, has won the Variety Award for bringing British film into the international spotlight.
The awards were handed out during a ceremony at London's Round house.
Control chronicles Curtis' rise to success with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, aged 23.
The black and white film, with a soundtrack by The Killers, David Bowie and New Order, was made on a budget of just £3 million.
But the Dutch photographer, best known for his iconic cover of U2's Joshua Tree album, won two awards, the first for best director and the second for best debut director.
The Rock also won Best Documentary for Julien Temple's film about Clash singer Joe Strummer.
The Best Actor award went to Viggo Mortensen for his portrayal of a Russian mafia boss's chauffeur in the London-based thriller directed by David Cronenberg, Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, known for his tough character portrayals, won the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to British film.
The 50-year-old director, who has made films such as Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the sequel to Indiana Jones, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award named in honor of the Harris star, who starred in Camelot and Harry Potter, and died in 2002.
Richard Harris and Albert Finney have allowed people like me to have access to cinema", he said.
I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris twice.
 I was admiring this great actor of today, I was extremely honored 
The Independent Film Awards, better known as the Oscars, are awarded by a jury of directors, actors, and festival organizers.

Saudi Arabia blocks 208 terrifying plots against the people of Iran
Saudi Arabia yesterday revealed that it has arrested 208 militants involved in organizing cells plotting an imminent attack on an oil site, as well as attacks on clerics and the military.
State television from the world's largest oil exporter, said one of the cells smuggled missiles.
Al Qaeda sympathizers have staged a campaign against the US-allied monarchy since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign resident, was planning an attack on an oil site in the Eastern Province, the TV newspaper said.
Saudi Arabia quickly assembled a group of 35,000 soldiers to protect the sites, following a failed 2006 Al Qaeda attack on the largest oil field at Abqaiq.
The newspaper quoted a statement from the interior minister as saying that 18 of those arrested belonged to a cell led by a missile launching expert who infiltrated the country.
It is said that the militants were planning the counter-strike of eight missiles in the kingdom.
Twenty-two of the detainees appear to have plotted the assassination of clerics and armed forces.
The government has urged clerics to do more against the Saudi-led insurgency in Iraq, to join the militants of Al Qaeda fighting against the Allied Forces and against the US-allied Shiite Muslim government, considered heretical by the hardline Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaeda militants believe that in Saudi Arabia many clerics have collaborated with the authorities to support the policies of the royal family that dominates the government.
The militants, encouraged by calls against the pro-Western Saudi government by Saudi-born Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
"Important efforts have been made by the armed forces during these last five months", the spokesman for the interior minister told state television.
Among the detainees are 16 members of the Medina, organized into a "media cell" to promote "takfiri" thought, the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims that supports the use of violence against infidels and apostates.
Among the detainees, 32 people are accused of having subsidized the militants.
The climate of Venus could reveal the future of Earth.
Scientists yesterday declared that Venus was certainly a habitable planet.
Data from the European spacecraft in orbit have shown that the planet is certainly twice as small as Earth, contrary to what was previously thought.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
These two worlds are practically the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to Earth's, and may even have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect from carbon dioxide, the erosion of the atmosphere from solar radiation, combined with a slower rotation, has led Venus into a whole different kind of evolution.
Today the planet is without water, ravaged by hurricanes and thunderstorms, and has a surface temperature hot enough to melt lead.
The findings of the European Space Agency's Venus Express probe, which has been studying the planet for a year, offer a bleak picture of Earth's potential future due to catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the University of Oxford's physics department, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: 'We are beginning to understand why the climate of Venus is so different from that of Earth, although the planets themselves are practically similar.
Our new data allows us to establish a scenario that billions of years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to Earth, perhaps even with a habitable surface.

A kilo of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was seized by the Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police officer said three people were arrested and the equipment is being analyzed.
He did not confirm that it was uranium, but revealed that the merchandise was worth $1 million (£480,000).
Still open to everything
Mitt Romney said he's not up to running for president, answering questions from a snowman.
Despite this, the Republican presidential candidates eventually agreed to participate in the You Tube debate, during which many ordinary voters who had recorded their questions submitted them to the candidates.
On Wednesday night, November 28, none of the questions asked were as ridiculous as the one from another YouTube debate, when a snowman asked Democrats their position on global warming.
But this time, the questions and answers reflected a lot of the conditions of the Republican Party, candidate in the next election.
We don't know what criteria the producers of CNN, who sponsored the debate, used to select the YouTube clips to show the would-be candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest ever on a single topic, focused on immigration.
The issue is one of the Republicans' strongest.
CNN asked some voters to call in when they heard funny things: The board found approval ratings soared when candidates spoke rudely.
The toughest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the National Front, and Mr. Romney who is leading the important early elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani has tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodating about illegal immigration during his tenure as mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of employing illegal immigrants in his home.
The two fighters became particularly fierce when asked if they would be willing to promote "amnésie" (offering illegal immigrants regular status and the possibility of becoming citizens).
Minor candidates like Duncan Hunter, a congressman from California, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman from Colorado, have been able to delve deeper into this topic.
Neither of them has the chance to be elected, but both remain in the race, perhaps thanks to the fact that they started fighting immigration earlier and more incisively than the others.
Generally speaking, the candidates, at least on immigration, have the same views: tighter borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This, along with concerns about toxic toys made in China, and other concerns about the outside world, have led Republicans to forget or downplay the divisions between libertarians and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate became especially embarrassing when other issues were raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the gun control campaign.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated whether putting water in your nose should be considered torture.
One of the speakers asked the candidates if they believed the Bible in its entirety.
This has led Mr. Giuliani to say that the Bible is his favorite book, even though he is not sure about believing the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another speaker asked if Jesus would have approved of the death penalty.
One would not expect Mike Huckabee, who was the leading candidate in a recent Iowa election because of his longstanding Christian conservatism, to say that the death penalty is painful but necessary.
When pressed to find out if Jesus would be in favor, he laughed and said that Jesus was too handsome to run for office.
The human race remains unusually open to anything.
Mr. Huckabee's rise in Iowa coincides with the recent prodigious grant-seeking efforts of Libertarian Ron Paul, and the whistles in Wednesday's debate.
These two have emerged from nowhere, thanks to the fact that the two party proteges cannot agree on who is the more popular and more traditionalist candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, one candidate united the party early and convincingly with a message of success about American greatness bringing leaders closer together.
This time the party is divided and the outcome is far from clear.
The pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has found a new hole to sink into; even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
Given the pattern of British scandals, this one is not particularly juicy.
No sold decorations, no bills from the Paris hotels of politicians, no extra-marital toes sucked.
But now a revelation that a wealthy businessman had hidden his contributions to the current Labour Party, worth over £650,000 ($1.3m), under false names for four years, which the party would not have declared: a new battle that Gordon Brown would have been fine without.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister backtracked on his election plan, foolishly insulting British intelligence by proclaiming that the opinion polls had not influenced his decision, and that he hoped instead to deliver a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, as Vince Cable, the brilliant liberal Democrat leader, has said, the terrifying Mr. Brown has transformed himself from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The takeover of Northern Rock, a struggling bank on the brink of crack, demonstrated a flaw in the guidelines and poor judgment in an emergency.
The inadequate proposals for changes to the tax code have provoked a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data by the tax authorities has revealed an incredible administrative blunder.
A trio of retired generals have launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting against cuts to military spending: they have proclaimed that being Minister of Defence is for them, a part-time job.
At present, suspicion of suspicious donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labour general secretary (and his former vigilante chief) have forced him to resign.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is headed for the exit.
Yet governments can reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People don't like politicians, and they don't trust them, but they usually put their doubts aside when a new government comes into power.
It seems clear that a prime minister cannot make things better, or even govern for long, when he is at risk of suspension: the public administration is out of order; cabinets of ministers are being checked; the press is looking for bad stories; and the government is on the defensive and has no purpose.
In a sense, Mr Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast of being a beginner.
Although he would like to remove Tony Blair, he was still his senior lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and with tax data, for example, are related to decisions taken by Mr Brown when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer.
And even if he is not directly involved in Blair's misfortunes, such as the lengthy investigation into party funds - the cash for members of the House of Lords - voters might think otherwise.
But Mr. Brown's predicament is not as tragic as it may seem.
The blunders are not as monstrous as the Tory Party members make them out to be.
Like Mr. Bean, there are no victims and no scam.
And the remedy, however painful, might be to materialize Mr. Brown's old Stalinist tendencies in favor of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new political donation scandal is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very particular character, who compares his donations to charity, said he did not want any public recognition of his charity.
He may have an opinion, but it's not his call.
Laws against the anonymity of politicians' big donors are clear, and they exist for a good reason: The public has a right to know who contributes to the success of those who will govern the country.
Mr. Watt, who claimed to be aware of Mr. Abrahams's programs, without knowing that it was illegal, will therefore be questioned, as will, incidentally, Jon Mendlesohn, the fundraising manager who spoke of questionable donations in October.
But so far Mr Brown is not involved: there is no indication that he was aware of these proceedings, even though most of the payments made were made as a result of his arrival in government in June.
So far the Prime Minister has done half.
He was quick to condemn his party's legislative loophole, but he failed to draw attention to the fact that the decision-making power rests on something he knows well, the use of a committee of inquiry on this subject composed of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to be learned are not complicated.
And if the law was broken, it's the police's job.
In addition, there are many other things Mr Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has been without a leader for six months, and preparing a good reform on the financing of political parties.
It would force the Labour Party, in a moment of weakness, to collaborate with the Tories, which might lead to it giving up its particular financial relationship with the confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a partisan like Mr Brown.
But he'll have to face some partisan facts.
The Conservative Party now has a good lead in the election; it has two years to win back the electorate, and the only way to secure a victory is to demonstrate impeccable integrity and sound skills.
Card and card fraud.
Would the mortgage crisis contaminate the U.S. credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's normal to see some flapping fins, swirling around.
Now that the U.S. housing market is in crisis, predators are targeting the U.S. credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs believe that credit-card losses could reach $99 billion if the contagion spreads from mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are rises in the expense and insolvency rates, which measure the shares of the balance sheet that are not recoverable or are recoverable, more than 30 days after.
HSBC announced last month that it took $1.4 billion in consumer credit, in part because of weak cardholders.
It's too soon to panic.
The costs and insolvencies are still moderate.
According to Moody's, a tax agency, the third quarter insolvency rate of 3.89% is almost one point below its historical average.
The deterioration in rates is partly explained by technical factors.
A change in the laws in 2005 in the United States regarding personal bankruptcy caused a sharp drop in bankruptcy filings, which in turn caused heavy losses for credit cards; the number of filings (and thus insolvency rates) could increase even if borrowing conditions were to worsen.
The industry also advertises fixed payment rates, which highlight the amount of monthly debt that consumers have to pay.
And confidence in the safety of credit card capital is quite strong despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicted that the 2007 emission volume will be 25% higher than last year.
Direct contagion links between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers may prefer to increase their debt now that equitable home loans have disappeared.
But card issuers are more concerned with cash flow than asset value, and so the fall in house prices has not necessarily led to a change in the creditworthiness of borrowers.
They may even provide advantages to credit issuers.
Consumer premiums for mortgage payments fall if properties cost less than the value of the loan; therefore, credit card debt would become a priority to pay it all back.
Card issuers are able to respond much more quickly and with more flexibility than mortgage companies to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or alter credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid stock recovery.
"We're not going to wake up one morning and re-evaluate every loan", said Gary Perlin, Capital One's chief executive.
If a financial disaster in the credit card market is unlikely, there are strong chances of a significant decline.
If lower housing prices and a contraction in the credit market is driving America into recession, the industry will certainly face a macabre future.
Watch the dorsal fins carefully.
British bankers plead guilty in the Enron case.
The three British bankers who were due to testify about their roles in a fraud committed by Enron's former chief financial officer, Mr Andrew Fastow, changed their plea to guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had initially pleaded not guilty to seven counts of alleged collusive fraud in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial scam to enrich himself at the expense of their employees.
They should be in court in January.
But during a hearing presided over by U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., they all pleaded guilty to committing fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland PLC group, have become famous throughout Britain because of the two-year extradition proceedings.
In the United States, their case remains an open point in this investigation launched after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
The charges against them in 2002 made Fastow aware that he was the subject of the government's investigation into the Enron debacle.
The charges against the bankers, dubbed the "Natwest Three", allege they came to Houston in 2000 to set up a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former right-hand man, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partner controlled by Fastow, who was the mastermind of many fraudulent scenarios, which helped him rig the bankruptcy proceedings.
In early 2002, the bank had estimated its interest in the subsidiary as zero, but in fact the three British already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the bank's interest in the subsidiary for £1 million.
The bankers paid $250,000 to Kopper as interest on this company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely told Enron that the energy company was willing to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But the truth is that $20 million went into the pockets of the British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the indictment, the bankers were awarded $7.3 million while Fastow, Kopper and others were awarded $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty for his active role in two conspiracies in the Enron debacle.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving three years and one month in a Texas prison.
The three British men were released on $1 million bail each, which obliged them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, once the seventh largest company in the nation, went bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, and could no longer hide its billions in debt or even offer its phony speculations as profitable.
The collapse caused thousands of job cuts, more than $60 billion in lost market value and more than $2 billion in lost pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their involvement in the company's collapse.
Skilling was sentenced to over 24 years in prison.
Charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other offenses were dropped due to his death from a heart attack last year.
Not under, not out of Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and possessing a fuel range sufficient to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But that's just a small change for some Russians.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers", said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
Even though no one really needs so many seats as it is more of a family aircraft or for the president of a company. 
Mr. Firer was at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaire's Ball, a four-day consumer-incentive orgy held at a huge exhibition center around the nation's capital.
Besides Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their booths, hoping to interest the newly rich Russians in their various products, ranging from mahogany yachts to diamond-filled cars like those of 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer was looking at a shiny orange Porsche on display next to his booth.
"It's a nice car, but nothing like our product", he said.
 Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft after the United States. 
 Thanks to an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be rolling in black gold, like Dallas 
"We had the same thing in the 1890s, when some Americans got so rich and landed in Europe where they were considered materialists", said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar in the Davis Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudis in the 1970s, the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the world's biggest spenders.
The biggest luxury brands are looking for a place in the Klondike.
This week, in another part of Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on the strategy for selling luxury goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which is owned by The New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires worth $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the world's richest people.
Moreover, two thirds of the rich are made up of 103,000 Russian millionaires who are worth a total of $670 billion, according to a study of personal wealth trends in the former Soviet Union, conducted by economists at the Center for Economic and Financial Research.
(The World Bank reported that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, that's why we are all here", said Nicole Marais, a representative of Davis Morris, a London jeweller.
She was participating in the show for the first time with the Russian distributor, Le Groupe Bijoutier de Soho.
The women are all well-prepared and the men are worth a fortune.
Walking through the living room on Sunday night, the two real estate agents, dressed in their 31s, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, declare that they are like their clients, millionaires.
 I looked at the cars and tried to choose between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche  said Melle Yumatova, who grabbed her high-fashion dress like a red carpet veteran like Joan Rivers.
The show seems to be aimed primarily at the new rich, the kind of Russian-brand shoppers who are willing to queue in traffic jams to come to a huge warehouse displaying Cadillac Escalades, platinum knives, Mövenpick ice cream, custom billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund teddy bears.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
 the Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and best brands  said Mr Gijrath, sitting proudly at the Royal Dutch Porcelain Factory Delf booth, in front of a mural by Raimbrant on blue tiles, handmade.
 it is certain that the Russians are more interested in bling bling 
Indeed, the sellers here stated that Russians with old capital (10 to 15 years old is too much by Russian standards) have already moved from bright logos to a kind of limited edition brand that could not be sold at the show.
Despite this, thousands of people, whether millionaires, emissaries of millionaires or tourists, visit the exhibition every day.
And some of them even buy.
On the opening night of the exhibition last Thursday, Roman Ershow, the CEO of King Koil Beds, said he sold two sets of silk, cashmere, and cotton mattresses encrusted with gold threads.
On the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales manager of A1 Motorcycles, a company that equips cars with state-of-the-art alarm systems, also reported selling a Russian millionaire a shiny orange Porsche for $170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said he would sell three cars that look like wristbands, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, at $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter a car wheel designed for a Russian casino owner, who wanted it to be inlaid with Swarovski crystals to look like a roulette wheel.
The set of four is 22,000.
The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of ostrich skin, or a picture of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive with such tires  said Mr Karapetian.
He'll probably keep it in his garage which already contains 30 or 40 vehicles.
Even though many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian said that the expression  Russian millionaire  is not in vogue, given the increase in property prices here.
 if you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash  he said.
 There's more than you could ever imagine 
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel that emotion when they go to the booth of Alliance Continental, a Russian wealth management company.
The company set up four booths representing British telephone booths, filled with masses of counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said that his team printed 500,000 fake bills for Millionaire's Lounge.
Passers-by stop to throw lots of money, ask their friends to take pictures with their phones, amidst the false wealth or even pocketing a few million.
 you see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire,  said Mr Karyev.
Unlicensed surgeon suspected of homicide in New Jersey.
It was Thanksgiving Eve when Ronald Livingston was looking out the window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant and he noticed an ambulance that had just pulled up to the doors of the White Cape Cod on West Scott Avenue.
Then the police patrol came.
And then another.
 Then I saw the medical vehicle stop  Mr. Livingston, a restaurant manager, said Wednesday.
That's when I realized someone had died.
Authorities later learned that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant director of the Newark Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine if the cause of her death was a gesture by an unlicensed cosmetic surgeon, who police have yet to identify, who resides at 212 West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have not yet determined the cause of Ms. Arroyo's death, but they are confidently awaiting the results of toxicology tests, which will take some time, but should help solve the mystery death that has saddened the top ranks of the Newark Police Department.
Ms. Arroyo had been the assistant to Police Chief Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006, and her voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious", Mr. McCarthy said of Ms. Arroyo in a telephone interview Wednesday.
 She was like a pit bull 
She would have done anything to protect me .
Mr. McCarthy stated that Ms. Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, and that she left two sons, ages 14 and 11, and a daughter-in-law.
Eileen Walsch, spokesperson for Union County District Attorney Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives are trying to determine whether Ms. Arroyo died from an unauthorized surgery.
 It's a possibility to consider. 
 the investigation is ongoing. 
Authorities said they arrived at her place around 3:00 p.m.
And found Melle Arroyo on the couch.
She was declared dead.
A little over a week has passed since, and the authorities have said little about the investigation or even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh couldn't confirm whether Ms. Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine if any part of the house was used as a medical office.
Wednesday, no one answered the door at Miss Castro's house where a faded rose bush lies in the narrow cemetery in front, and a Dalmatian was barking in the back.
A blue can called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a vanilla substitute in cooking and for perfumes, was found in a hangar, next to a door that leads to the basement.
Two off-road bikes hanging on the sides.
McCarthy said that since her arrival in Newark 25 years ago, at the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo has been invaluable, helping her navigate the new city and let go of her framed political culture.
"You have to pay attention to this", he said.
She was there when I arrived, and she was there when I left.
 It was embarrassing 
Everyone is hoping that the Federal Reserve will lower rates in the wake of the global stock market boom.
Stocks soared on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after markets hoped the Federal Reserve would try to calm credit conditions, later cutting interest rates promoted by the central bank's vice president's soothing statements.
Stock markets are booming in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, second only to Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said that decision makers must be "flexible and pragmatic" in their actions in the turbulent financial markets.
In an apparent effort to reassure the jittery markets in the face of these new credit-related tensions, Mr Kohn said that the recent turbulence had partly reversed some improvements in market functioning in late September and October.
The Commission has also been asked to provide a report on the implementation of the new rules on the protection of the financial interests of the Union.
These comments are seen by investors as a clear signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into the US markets, and that further interest rate cuts could stabilise credit conditions.
Those remarks also helped to calm Wall Street with even more bad news about the U.S. economy, such as the biggest fall in real estate sales for the month of October.
The impact of this financial turmoil was heightened by the announcement by investment bank Bear Stearns that it would lay off 650 people, or 4 percent of its staff, to reduce costs to offset heavy losses from losing bets on real estate loans.
Only 20 posts are planned in London, where the bank employs 1500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose by 331 points, or 2.55%, to 13,289.40, while the largest index, the S&P 500, gained 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points or 2.7% to 6306.2 adding more than £39 to the value of British companies.
The German Dax index rose by 2.6% and the French CAC40 rose by 2.3%.
Previously, the re-emergence of credit problems in the markets was highlighted by strong demand for an auction of quarterly funds issued by the European Central Bank, which cut loans to European commercial banks at a heavy 4.7% rate, the highest since April 2001.
Pressures on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and inject further funds into London's financial markets causing credit strains, caused monthly borrowing rates in UK banks to rise to their highest since last September, at 6.59% following a sharp rise since 12 November.
England faces an appeal of judgment against the criticisms of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are faced with two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the No. 6 batsman for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in a context as broad as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the chairman of the selectors who was there exceptionally to help Peter Moores, head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, make their decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, the chairman and managing director of England, is starting to fill out the application forms to become a national coach, at least part-time.
Whoever doesn't make it to the number six backpack is unlucky, but life is often unfair and so is sport.
It is never easy to destroy what allows one man to reach the top of his profession while another will never get beyond the lower level, sometimes more by lack of luck than lack of skill.
It's not just cricket where selection is difficult, because in the end, judgment is still subjective.
Is this a good time to bring up Bopara?
Is it just about Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, which would be to choose between John Edwards or Banerjee  tubby ; both, new executives with good degrees, professional, should be promoted: but there is room for only one of them.
Who has the right to determine the proper standard of a cricketer unless he is given at least a chance?
The numbers are important in making decisions, but so are the opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricketer must capture the captain's eye, at the same time he must take the wicket and a batsman must be lucky to touch the one-day cricketer.
But catching the eyes of the selectors is much more complicated.
Many did better last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed certain to play the first Test, even though Stephen Harmison declared himself fit and continued to practice serving.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 overs to earn a place.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 at the same average, but both have already had their moment of glory at the highest level and hope to deliver more.
Whether it will be Shah or Bopara who will play at Asgiriya Stadium, it is just a matter of opinion.
It could ruin or build a man's career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and did well in the first, with five wickets and 40 assists, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was also struggling to emerge, who managed to become the Test cricketer of the century, and that, despite the fact that his double hundred against Australia in Australia may still be underestimated.
Probability predicts that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at Asgiriya Stadium, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and favor Shah's greater experience against the exuberance of young Bopara.
Both have good arguments.
In favour of Shah, his brilliant and considerable start to the 88 Test innings in Bombay, 32 first-class centuries against six for Bopara, who at 22 is seven years younger, and his excellent batting ranking.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Test at Lord's, his home town of Middlesex players, and that, the immediate rejection by the selectors when Vaughan again in form, claimed his place for the next match, seems to have plagued his so obvious spirits in Bombay.
Unlike him, the Essex player is full of the joy of life.
He's not afraid of anything on a cricket pitch and he went overboard when he recently capsized on a 4x4 at a presentation by Volkswagen, England's sponsor.
He only suffered minor injuries, was shocked, even though the first thing he did was to take his Vodafone (sponsor of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who was watching him from afar, to ask him if he had seen this?
Bopara is by far the best drummer, his sharp-looking looks allow him to do the job he wants, and he beats with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe that's the true art of selection?
I would be more than willing to give Bopara his chance, which doesn't mean that Shah shouldn't apply if, as the tea leaves suggest, he's the one playing this weekend.
Buses take people back to work, and to fight against al Qaeda.
The first bus full of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, unloading exiles without money or visa renewals, or others hoping the city will return to normal.
Some have returned to fight against the militants who drove them from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the 800 people from Damascus arrived in convoys of dozens of official government buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned on their own.
 I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad  said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
 I came back today because I saw on TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and saw that the city is safer now. 
"They say the Mahdi army is no longer committing crimes!" he said, referring to the Shia militia of clerical militant Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his men to stay away for the time being.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the Sunni-dominated area of Amariyah, returned home with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevents Iraqis from working.
His Shia neighbors in Amariyah called him to inform him that the US-backed militia had successfully driven Al Qaeda out of the western part of the capital, and invited him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is the head of a Sunni and Shia tribe who was forced to leave his home north of Baghdad because of a grenade attack after he incited citizens to rebel against Al-Qaeda.
But he had to go home to fight.
 Two days ago, some of my friends called me and said they had set up an anti-Al Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and they needed me and my boys. 
 That is why I am coming home today  said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many say they have been drawn to the increasing calm in the capital since the US troops arrived, and to the continued training of  groups of citizens involved  well-armed and collaborating with the US military to defend their neighborhood.
But others say they were forced to return because of visa problems and the decline of the capital Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis fled in the past years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, father of three, expressed the suspicion felt by all about the exile visas that Nuri al-Maliki, the Shia prime minister, allegedly asked the Syrian government to restrict to force people to return to the country.
Over two and a half million people have reportedly fled the country because of the sectarian death squads.
 we had no problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and urged the government to stop giving visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq  said the Sunni pensioner.
 I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house when I was gone 
The decline in violence can be partly explained by the fact that Sunnis have been driven out of Shia areas and vice versa, creating places where tensions are less.
There is concern that a sudden influx of refugees could further escalate sectarian tensions and bring back fighting.
Little Sarre, good form, you know?
The smallest state is a leader in vocational training and is even outstanding in the international orientation of its higher education institutions.
The Saar are suffering from a deficit in only one area, similar to the rest of the country.
"I explained to a non-Sarri yesterday for the 50th time that we are not French" - that is the slogan that the smallest federated state, out of self-deprecation, is displaying for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the training system of the Saarland, which is ranked fifth in the training index of the German Institute of Economics in Cologne.
Thus, by tradition, the higher education institutions have close cooperation with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Sarrebruck in 1948 by the French.
To date, students have the opportunity to complete their studies there with a double or even a triple degree.
This is evidenced by the high proportion of foreign students, 15.6 per cent.
The Saar also leads the country's children to higher education in higher numbers than the average - many of them without a Gymnasium diploma.
"In the Saar, we take advantage of the vocational training system", says Axel Plünnecke, training expert at IW.
More than one in five young people graduate from a vocational school, and the Saarland is more than seven points above the national average.
The possibilities of combining vocational and academic training are therefore relatively well developed.
In terms of population, the dual-course panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and a growing demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
This is why the Ministry of Education in the region has forced the higher education institutions to launch a marketing campaign in the engineering sciences.
"After the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools", says a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
The government has introduced statewide comparative tests.
In order to get children to start learning earlier, the last year of kindergarten is exempt from school fees - a model that has since been copied by other states.
Only future comparative studies will be able to show whether pupils' performance is improving in a lasting way.
In the PISA studies in 2003, the proportion of at-risk students decreased from 29 to 20 per cent.
Overall, however, the Saarland did not improve as much as other federal states.
The Bavarians are doing better.
And despite the Sarrians, foreign language skills are not measured by the PISA studies - otherwise we could gain points in this area.
Because the language of the neighbourhood is compulsory in secondary schools - even if the Saar are not French.
Chavez is setting the clocks.
In Venezuela, the clocks will soon tick differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chavez will set the clock back half an hour in the South American country.
Chavez meanwhile becomes a caricature in Spain.
As Venezuela's official newspaper reported, a new law will set clocks to half past four o'clock.
In this way, the South American country obtains a time zone that does not exist in any other state in the world.
The anti-American Chávez justified his position by the fact that the United States had imposed on the world the separation of time zones in full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) the termination of relations with the neighboring country, Colombia, due to a hostage situation.
The left-wing nationalist announced that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia, he will have no relations with the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do it, just because of my dignity", said Chávez, who is pushing for a constitutional reform that the citizens of the oil-rich country will have to vote on in a referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, he would significantly strengthen his power in the country.
The triggering element of this dispute was Uribe's decision to withdraw from Chávez the mandate to negotiate the release of hostages with the Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe would have "spat in the face" of Venezuela with this decision, had criticized Sunday Chavez.
In Spain, too, Chavez is on everyone's lips.
A new cell phone ringing has been all the rage in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (why don't you shut up) is the phrase that has already been downloaded by more than half a million people on the internet.
It was spoken by the King of Spain, Juan Carlos, who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was annoyed by the constant interpellations of left-wing populists and told him to keep quiet.
A fall in wages threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong economic situation, according to a forecast, a real decline in the value of wages threatens German employees this year.
Experts have given various reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees should expect a real decrease in their payroll in 2007 compared to the previous year.
"The fault lies with the low wage growth, the increase in the value added tax and the rising prices of food and energy", Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Business Research told Bild.
The unemployment insurance of the employee may also be subject to new charges.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the planned 3.3% reduction in unemployment insurance for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to feel embarrassed about asking the Federation for credits or financial aid, according to the SPD politician.
It was reported on Tuesday that the explosion in food and oil prices had pushed the rate of inflation to its highest level in 13 years.
In total, prices increased by 3.0 per cent from one year to the next.
Venus is the infernal twin of the Earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere, Venus is more Earth-like than previously thought: the European space probe Venus Express has detected lightning in the atmosphere and wind whirls at the poles, similar to those seen on Earth in winter.
For almost three decades, scientists have speculated that there are lightning bolts on Venus.
The European probe "Venus Express" has now provided evidence of this - it detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: lightning on Venus erupts from cloud to cloud at a height of about 35 miles [56 km], reports Christopher Russel of the University of California, Los Angeles, in the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous cyprinid theory, lightning bolts would have brought life to Earth: the storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstone of life.
This is not the case on Venus: "If life existed there, it must have been at a very early date in history", says Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
There should be little life on the surface of Venus today. The atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, and temperatures can reach 500 degrees Celsius.
"Venus may be the infernal twin of the Earth, but she's still a twin", Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in mass and dimensions, was hit by such a different evolution, is the fundamental question of the ASE mission.
The departure of the Venus Express in November 2005 was a milestone in the Venusian search, as no other probe had been on its way to explore this planet since the 1990s.
In the opinion of the researchers, the most recent research results which have now been presented in several articles in "Nature" do not only underline the singularity of Venus within the solar system.
They also show that our neighboring planet Earth has more in common with it than was originally thought.
So, in addition to the wind whirlwinds already known at the North Pole, the researchers found a whirlwind of clouds at the South Pole that rotates even faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of the air currents in the Earth's hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers led by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second planet in the solar system is almost as massive as the Earth and is almost as large, with a diameter of 7,500 miles.
The planet, called the evening or morning star, orbits the sun in just 225 days.
However, its rotation is much slower: a day on Venus lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, bears little resemblance to Earth, scientists speculate that the two planets formed under similar conditions.
On both, water accumulated and remained on Earth as oceans, but was lost to space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on Earth as carbonate, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama.
President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler demands an end to the party quarrel over the Dalai Lama's reception at the Chancellery.
Indirectly, he was criticizing the SPD for the attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about the image of Germany and sums up the great coalition to end the quarrel over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We must not present to the outside world a nation divided on this issue", Köhler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights are universally valid, even if I respect the differences between cultures", said Köhler.
The Commission has also adopted a proposal to extend the scope of the directive to include the protection of the environment and the environment from the risks arising from the use of chemicals.
The German Chancellor did not distance herself from the traditional one-China policy.
"China knows it too", said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed his dissatisfaction with the reception of the Dalai Lama and had been attacked for this outside the ranks of the CDU.
Steinmeier had complained in particular of the CDU's "fore-entry policy" in foreign policy.
After the Dalai Lama's reception at the Chancellery, virulent irritations were felt in German-Chinese relations.
Thus the Chinese government not only dismissed German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to Spiegel reports, also froze the so-called strategic dialogue between the foreign ministers of the two countries.
China's Premier Wen Jiabao now demands that German Chancellor Angela Merkel admit that welcoming the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China refuses to allow European politicians to receive the Tibetan spiritual leader in his official capacity, thus supporting the Chinese position.
The words and actions of the Dalai Lama would show that he is trying to separate Tibet and other Tibetan areas from China, which also includes other current provinces.
Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
Street fighting with police, gunfire, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots like those in France
The German Interior Minister has demanded that all efforts be made to prevent social discontent in Germany from erupting into violence in the streets.
The Commission's proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment is a very important one, and it is a very important one.
We must be careful that a social explosion does not take place in our own country and turn into violence.
We must take this seriously", he told the "Neue Presse" in Hanover.
Not all young people would be able to cope with the rapid changes in social reality.
The federation, the Länder and the communes were already working hard to reduce the problems, Schäuble said.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"From integration summits to conferences on Islam, it already shows its first successes".
But it would be too early for a final warning.
Schäuble also points out that in the German suburbs there are no sociological or urban planning problems as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people had engaged in serious street battles with the police during the previous nights.
In Toulouse too, cars and public buildings were burned.
The President of the Turkish Communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat, called for greater efforts to integrate the German Government.
In view of the riots in France, Kolat warned against "the effects of imitation".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
But there would still be a need for action.
Kolat emphasises that the unemployment rate among young people under 25 years of age from immigrant backgrounds is higher than the average.
First of all, more training places should be provided.
Kolat insisted: "We must give the young people a perspective".
The President of the Turkish Communities added, however, that social control in families was more common in Germany than in France.
Many young people of immigrant background also do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
"But we still have to be careful", Kolat urged.
It should be possible to give young people the opportunity to participate in work and training.
Meanwhile, in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, all was very quiet during the night.
Police units were on the scene, a helicopter was flying over the area with searchlights.
The authorities in the area reported three arrests and a few cars and trash cans burned.
Since the conference, a deployment of approximately 1,000 security forces has ensured calm.
Police will intervene as long as necessary, announced the Minister of the Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie, after a visit to the suburb.
On Tuesday night, nearly 80 police officers were injured in the riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The next night, the riots broke out in Toulouse.
The riots broke out after a traffic accident in which two young people lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the prosecutor's initial findings, the police are not responsible for the death of the youth.
In the empire of Angela Merkel.
The Chancellor's utopian entrance shows that the coalition is finished with the bottom - and that there is nothing to expect from it.
What country is this chancellor living in?
After her regrettable intervention in the general debate in the German Parliament, which was chaotic and lacking in substance, it must be said: not here - not in the country which should ultimately be governed by her.
The criticism of too much focus on politics was countered by Angela Merkel with a harsh and presumptuous phrase.
It is provincial, she said, and only showed that she does not want to understand what the critics want.
In Parliament she made it clear to everyone how correct that reproach was.
There was no real interest or feeling for the problems of the country to be felt.
Instead, Angela presented herself as a cloud: a weightless politician, fleeing into foreign policy and even there staying in the middle.
For example, the protection of the climate: in this area, it repeatedly welcomes the Heiligendam agreements, but does not say how the climate objectives will have to be achieved in our country.
Even the praise of oneself - to have such a lack of modesty, the CDU leader would have refused it two years ago.
Now it clings to the formula that growth will affect people.
It destroys its image as a pragmatist, a problem solver, instead of a beautifier.
But in the realm of the Angela cloud, domestic political problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the concerns of low-wage workers?
He has a few more lines to go with that.
The number of times that she has failed to do so in the matter of family allowance is revealing.
Here, Merkel needs three starts to say a half-accurate sentence.
She's stumbling into unknown territory, from the moment it becomes concrete.
The branch is coming in.
In the Republican presidential debate on YouTube, the two front-runners, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, are locked in a hard-fought battle - and now have to fear an outsider.
The tension between the candidates already erupts at the first subject.
He has made New York a "refuge for illegal immigrants", Mitt Romney blames his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
The latter, on the other hand, with heavy reproaches: "I would say that his own house was a haven for illegal immigrants", Giuliani replied and reproached the former governor of Massachusetts for having employed immigrants without papers.
The candidates are taking the offensive: since the Republican base also has no official favorites, the eight presidential candidates are using the debates on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur films that Internet users have uploaded via YouTube are little more than blasters.
"It was with this kind of isolationism that we let Hitler come to power", John McCain told his running mate Ron Paul, who is the only candidate in the race to call for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also takes a hard line from Vietnam veterans when he refuses to condemn as torture what is called "waterboarding", a method of interrogation that simulates drowning.
However, the fact that the campaign's important themes go beyond the war in Iraq and the debate on torture is seen in the reactions of the St. Petersburg, Florida, town hall.
Whether the conservative values are praised or future tax increases are rejected, applause is pouring out of the audience.
This is where the weaknesses of the two favourites once again come to light.
"I made a mistake back then", Romney said, and apologized to the base and the TV audience for being an abortionist back in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, is a bit of a loose cannon when asked for his opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civilian clothes.
A day after his retirement as army chief, Pakistani power-man Musharraf was inaugurated as president.
Thus ended eight years of military rule.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in on Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live from the presidential palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf has sworn to uphold the Constitution and act for the welfare of the Nation.
On Wednesday he handed over his command of the armed forces to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus yielded to international pressure, especially that of the United States.
Eight years after he seized power in a bloodless coup, the former general is now ruling for the first time as a civilian head of state.
By withdrawing from the post of commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled the main demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf had declared on November 3.
Soon after his inauguration, Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, thus fulfilling another Western demand.
The country's Supreme Court, which Musharraf had occupied after the imposition of the state of emergency with his own lawyers, last week dismissed all appeals against the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four others were wounded.
According to the military spokesman, a bomb exploded in a street near the Afghan border.
The fathers of Krautrock are back.
The supergroups of the 1970s are back in action: the three members of the band Harmonia have once again taken their console to a concert in Berlin.
For their comeback came recordings of their big hit "Live 1974".
By then, they were already well known abroad.
The anticipated sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen announced on the evening's poster.
Everyone has their little box in front of them, their cable and above all their buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63, sitting in the middle in a snow-white shirt.
Flanked on the left is Michael Rother, a young 57-year-old with a laptop and a guitar.
On the right, seen by the entire auditorium, is Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, bent over on his console.
Each contributes to the noise, including a Beat.
And sometimes it's added to a piece of traditional music inadvertently.
It does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the Harmonia band is playing again has ensured some emotion among Krautrock fans.
We have the right to reveal it here: targeted polls reveal that, yes, the name resonates in the collective memory of pop, but in no way so lastingly that this group has been so painfully missing for 32 years.
But why should not the German people also have the right to celebrate the living legends of the seventies?
Especially since the deceptively named "Krautrock" has always been more popular in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded the 2003 Echo Award to the surviving members of the Cologne-based band Can for their work, the German pop stars were seen in the room questioning.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the groups Düsseldorf and Neu! in the panegyric praise, the amazement was boundless.
Later, during concerts, Michael Rother would jump on the Red Hot Chili Peppers stage like an old friend.
The problem of ignorance in the self and transfiguration in the unknown is the only one.
The memory is therefore already taken by Harmonia, because the trio existed for only two years and that during this period the power of impact felt was much weaker than what was attributed to it later by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously performed with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
We first played in the basements under the Berlin stage.
Then to Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly struggled in Kraftwerk and had finally made a name for himself as a guitarist with Neu!, which was at the time perhaps the most radical German band.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed the Cluster musicians into exile in the forests of the Weserbergland.
There, in an old farmhouse on the Weser, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the "Kommune I" community, where Roedelius had the right to be tortured as a nurse.
More of an artistic existence in the Spitzweg way.
Supposedly found in the trash a flag of the Harmonia Ottenstein choir and also a name for the art.
A lot of harmony held away from that.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia", and the next one was called "De Luxe".
For as serene and humble as the music sounded, the band suffered from material poverty.
The harvesting of the dead wood was not merely for self-seeking.
The newly released CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem in front of a record audience of almost 50 people, as well as someone who thinks he remembers.
Rother expressed at that time the wish to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
It was an immoral demand for Roedelius and Moebius.
The band announced their split in 1975.
Rother landed in the spheres of esotericism and ensured its existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen" (hearts in flames).
Cluster re-emerged in the '80s and has since become more successful than Harmony ever was.
We owe the live album of Griessem to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His label Grönland has set itself the goal of nurturing Krautrock as an inherent German contribution to contemporary music.
Neu! had already been unearthed on this occasion as Roedelius' personal work.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
Publicly funded, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
There's Julian Cope, the British former punk and author of the paperback Krautrock Sampler.
There's also the inventor of the Love Parade, Dr. Motte.
By which the whole margin of fluctuation of Krautrock influence would be circumscribed with respect to future pop music.
The space left vacant by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno's line floats through the room amidst the singles: "The only real music, you're listening to the future".
There are photos that show the producers with Harmonia in the farmhouse room.
Other black-and-white projections of wired tools in the bazaar serve to form the legend.
The three veterans in front are busy improvising again.
But not by attaching microphones to the organ and the drums, to pull the instruments to the sound of the unheard instruments through the instruments of self-made effects.
Today, electronic music is like electronic music.
All three of them are very technical.
Even the house choir will not change that.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, we cough and whisper under the cloud of sounds, and at a nice moment we sing "Aaaaaaaah" with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very British concept.
It was never about rock.
The roots have been less sought in blues than in music conservatories (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the flight from artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever cries "68" is not entirely wrong, and Harmonia is not irritated by it anymore either.
But the most self-serving will be covered thoroughly on stage.
Where does the music begin and where does it end?
It can be a nerve-wracking (?) experience or a fleeting moment of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Killer Peace", two films again address the Balkan war.
But neither of them convinces.
Either the projects are too much action and pointless gunfights or they are too tearful.
Here, even Richard Gere in The Hunting Party can't help himself.
The good news first: the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but it is precisely there, in the most grim hinterland of the Bosnian war, that the actor Richard Gere is now found.
We had finally lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties, because too many gentle and trivial roles in films with female sentiment and too many press conferences on the theme of Buddhism had made him want to show himself.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument for watching "The Hunting Party" anyway - when the hunter becomes the hunted (why do today's films have to be as long and confusing as collective agreements of locomotive drivers?)
He delivers a magnificent and winking portrayal: at the heart of his character, war reporter Simon Hunt is what Gere might have become, if fate and the film industry had not been so kind: a man whose best days are long behind him, but who, even as a ruined monument to his decline, has nevertheless retained visible remnants of his old charm.
But despite this asset, "The Hunting Party" continues alongside the German production "Deadly Peace", which also comes out this week, the endless string of failed films about the Balkan war.
The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who rescue a Serb girl from the Kosovo snipers, with whom one of the two quickly falls in love again.
Although it is welcome that the Serbs are not for once presented as the sole cause of all evil, this film as flat as a TV movie gets lost far too quickly in the action and the senseless gunfights.
It's still a sort of "Cobra 11 Alert" with no highway but a war instead.
On the contrary, we can look at the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why there was never a really good film about the Balkan war.
The story of the three American war reporters, who condition themselves to track the top war criminal "the fox", might have become, with another director and another writer (both Richard Shepard), at another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because the stories are strikingly similar: two males go into the forest as a small team, to do something that the military can't do, and for both males, it becomes a journey into madness.
One of the reasons that "The Hunting Party" failed is that we simply don't let Simon Hunt be the desolate cynic with a heart, as he's presented to us in the beginning.
No, the script must also credit him with a romantic affair with a Bosnian woman who was later murdered.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitely bad, when the reporter, in the space of the last five minutes, by an accelerated process, succeeds in what NATO, the CIA and all the bounty hunters in the world have failed in five years: to catch the war criminal and leave him for just retribution to the Bosnian Muslims.
It's so bad that we should take it to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for the crime against cinematic logic.
In that case, the film has too deep a human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they must be exceptionally in agreement) of not conducting the hunt intensively enough because of secret political agreements.
But the well-intentioned and the evil one are so similar that a famous poem by Brecht comes to mind.
He speaks of a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's work table: "Compassionate, I see the veins of the forehead swollen, clearly: how tiring it is to be wicked".
Films like "The Hunting Party" have exactly such tumultuous heads, but insinuating how tiring it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of films about the Balkan war.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood movies about Iraq were huge flops.
We can add that there have never been good films about South Africa.
It's the same every time: when a star hangs out in a crisis center or a minefield, he then comes out with something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits go Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still just too close in time.
However, it was still decades before Hollywood could make a good movie about the Holocaust with "Schindler's List".
Some films are still to mature - the classics of Vietnam today, "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" and "Full Metal Jackett", were by no means universally celebrated as masterpieces in their day.
But maybe we also know just too much today about the conflicts of the world, where every hecatombe is live on two screens at home at the same time,
And it's a thrill for the writers to have the scruples they need to tell beautiful stories.
"To be or not to be" or "The Dictator" actually became as good as that because Lubitsch and Chaplin didn't know yet how much the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe you shouldn't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Maybe it's the artistic, sarcastic, distant gaze of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Lemprière's Dictionary" and the Balkan war, he replied: "It is only because some things never change".
"The big cities will always be horribly dangerous, the people will always be murdered in horrifying ways, and war will always be in Yugoslavia".
Von Beust is being criticized for canceling the Olympics.
The mayor's withdrawal from Hamburg's bid for the Summer Olympics has been met with fierce criticism in politics and economics.
Many want to continue fighting for the Waterfront Games.
But Von Beust calls for realism in the appreciation of odds.
The chief executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, on Wednesday described a drop as "bad for the local economy".
No other project in recent times has been as motivating for the city as the idea of the Olympics.
"Without this objective, the political-sports momentum could not have been maintained to the same extent".
The Commission is also calling for the EU to take a more active role in the fight against terrorism and to ensure that the EU is able to play its part in the fight against terrorism.
Mayor Ole von Beust on Wednesday stood by his earlier statements that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions were unrealistic at least until the year 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on a bid for the Olympics, but the German Olympic Sports Federation", Von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the expected decision of the sports federation in early December, about the bid of Munich for the 2018 Winter Games.
This preference means to us that, in the time frame we had planned until 2028, we will have no chance".
However, the dream is not definitely a thing of the past, said Von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted the statements made by Beust.
This would give the impression that Hamburg does not want to bid for the next 25 years.
"It is too early to close an opportunity by burying projects now", said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
The Commission has already submitted a proposal to the Council for a decision on the appointment of a representative of the European Parliament.
There, Von Beust reportedly described Hamburg's bid for the 2015 Universiade as "not a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Federation of Higher Schools for Sport had in the past weeks named Hamburg as a candidate city.
The SPD faction of the mayor blamed the Senate for not using this precious time in the construction of housing in Hamburg.
"The Petit Grasbrook development has been rejected by the Senate for years because it played the Olympics card and excluded housing construction", said SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always called for the Petit Grasbrook to be integrated into the Olympics and for the housing to be used later, the CDU has relied exclusively on the "Event factor".
The bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics would have generated great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Hamburg had however broken away from Leipzig.
These aren't Warhols boxes.
The one that links the concepts of Sweden and wooden crate, Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
At the moment, wooden boxes made in Sweden cast a shadow on Warhol's list of works.
A large part of the ninety "Type Stockholm" Brillo-Boxes listed there are forgeries.
After the Swedish newspaper Expressen questioned the authenticity of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo-Boxes a few months ago, the internal research at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm has now come to a dismal conclusion: the six Brillo-Boxes, which the former museum director Pontus Hulten gave to Moderna Museet in 1995, are copies - along with many of the hundreds of other Brillo-Boxes of the "Type Stockholm" that circulate on the international art market.
Ancient history is a tangle, a bewildering succession of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painted wooden boxes, based on the red-blue-white design of the "Brillo" powder soap boxes.
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet in 1968 - with Warhol's agreement - featured hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: These did not come from Warhol (for financial reasons), but had been delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but rather models of them, exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to produce some Brillo wooden crates in Sweden, which were not exhibited at the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time speak today of about fifteen wooden boxes which at the time would have entered the history of art and auctions as original Brillo-Boxes by Andy Warhol, with the designation "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have reached auction sales of over $100,000.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén Museum later claimed, wrongly, that about a hundred wooden crates had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol would later have given to him.
In fact, the 105 Hultén cases were produced in Malmö in 1990 alone, for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By that time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief curator of the Moderna Museet, examined, besides the six Brillo-Boxes in the museum, three others from Swedish private collections, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their laminated panels were first printed and sanded, then applied with a brush of white oil paint.
The texture of the 1990 copies, on the other hand, shows that the paint was applied directly without a backing layer on the laminated panels, using a paint roller - and it is not an oil paint but an acrylic paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol Brillo-Boxes", suggests Moderna Museet director Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to another decision, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibition material".
In July, the Authentication Board announced that it would investigate the "serious allegations" that were raised in the soap-powder case.
But since then, we've been living in an inexorable silence.
The rebel soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, the rebel soldiers are giving up, the same ones who had holed up in a hotel in Manila, and who had demanded the removal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who has accused the president of corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters at the hotel that he could not be held responsible for any bloodshed.
The hotel had been stormed by soldiers loyal to the government with tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been entrenched in the building for hours.
About half of them were in court on Wednesday for a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He took advantage of the audience to suddenly disappear with about 30 supporters.
The military police, who were normally supposed to keep an eye on them, had apparently deserted in his favor and joined the mutiny.
They broke into the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the removal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The troops loyal to the government have sealed the area around the respectable hotel.
The President called an emergency meeting of the Security Council.
National Security Advisor Norberto Gonzales condemned the action of the soldiers.
"People have had enough", said Trillanes.
"We are calling for people to join us".
General Danilo Lim, who previously commanded the elite Scout Ranger unit, said other units in the army wanted to join the march soon.
Critics of the regime had called for a large demonstration against the president on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded by accusations of corruption for months.
The financial district of Manila was already the scene of the 2003 mutiny attempt by about 200 members of the military against Arroyo.
The insurrection broke out almost 24 hours after the refusal of the army to join it.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven attempted coups against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder in Versatel.
United Internet has secured a stake of more than 20 percent in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as the company announced on Wednesday.
Only 20.05% of the share capital would be held.
We've speculated about a buyout before.
The option to increase the shareholding in Versatel further would remain open.
The move is aimed at accelerating the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet said.
Just before that, speculation had already been made on Wednesday about a takeover, after Berenberg Bank had increased its stake in the Düsseldorf network operator from 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The credit institution would hold only one-third of the money, the market says.
The day before, United Internet had already acquired a stake of nearly 10% in the mobile telephone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch put on the stock exchange 17,4 million new shares worth EUR 106,4 million.
United Internet bought 5.15 million of them for 31.1 million euros.
In addition, the companies have entered into negotiations on cooperation in the marketing of DSL and mobile telephony products.
"We are strengthening our partnership", said a United Internet spokesman.
The two companies set up the joint venture MSP to take over the competitor Freenet.
For the time being, the two companies want to consider themselves satisfied with their ten percent stake in Freenet, and not to exercise their right to buy an additional 18.49 percent stake in Freenet, United Internet said on Thursday.
The two companies would, however, leave all options open, especially to increase participation in the Freenet SA, it was learned.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership were concluded in mid-October.
The still unpredictable poker on Freenet which has been going on for months is part of the consolidation of the German telecoms market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile telephone contract and 1.27 million DSL and full subscription customers.
The holding company of United Internet and Drillisch held a direct stake in Freenet of 6.01% until now.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch would contribute about four per cent more.
The right to buy the 18.49% of the investment company Vatas had already been decided in August.
