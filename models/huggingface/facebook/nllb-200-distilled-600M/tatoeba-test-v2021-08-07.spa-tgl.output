The sad story made us cry.
Life is easy, death is cheap.
I'm washing my socks.
I'll tell you my story.
I left him a book, but he hasn't returned it yet.
He threw a stone at the dog.
Leo is cooking lumpia.
I read to learn.
He heard her cry in the middle of the night.
I'll clean my room later.
It's raining.
Dolphins and whales aren't fish.

Lucia called already?
Mama cried.
it's Sunday tomorrow.
Tomorrow is a party.
I'm going shopping tomorrow.
Maria bought flowers.
Maria became pregnant at the age of fourteen.
Maria became pregnant at the age of 14.
Mary has not yet begun.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
You helped me and I want to help you too.
I fell.
Can I have your knife?
I woke up from a nightmare.
I love teaching.
I love taking pictures.

I like your dogs.
I care.
You'd better go home now.
I wonder what she's thinking.
Can I eat that cake?
Can I go home now?
I waited a long time.
Mix rice with eggs and soy sauce.
My friend never leaves home without cigarettes.

I didn't get it.
He wasn't particularly nervous.
You're not allowed in there.
It's not such a big deal. You worry too much.
Don't yell at me.
There wasn't even a single table available in the whole restaurant.
There were no roses in the garden.
There's no escape.
There's no red thread.
There's nothing wrong with sleeping late on Sundays.
There's no dog bigger than this.
There's no problem.
No problem with that.
No, not at all.
No matter where I am.
No matter what he said.
️Don't forget to come at the time you've agreed.
No, but I play tennis.
Can't last long.
You can't imagine how much you've made me suffer.
You can't live on that island.
I can't go tonight.
I don't want to eat.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't know why.
I don't know if it's going to rain tomorrow.
You've hurt us badly!
He not only gave us clothes, but also some money.
We are not gods, but mere men.
We live in a society, not just an economy.
I'm not a doctor, I'm a teacher.
We went by the pharmacy before we got home.
One more.
I'll see you again tomorrow.
I won't leave you.
I'm not hiding anything from you.
️Don't go into the pool from the trampoline.
I don't have time to die.
Don't come near us until we forgive you One day you'll regret what you did.
You can't imagine how I feel about you.
He doesn't have to come tomorrow.
You don't have to answer this question.

Never imagined she was so smart.
Never press this button.
I hate hypocrisy.
What you say has no feet and no head.
Seems like there's always something to do.

Let's think about the worst that could happen.
I thought Tom would make breakfast.
I lost my phone.
Pardon us our sins.
I caught a big fish yesterday.
Can you repeat that?
Please close the door.
️Please send this by Federal Express.
Please forgive me for what I just said.
Please forgive me for asking such a personal question.
Why is change so hard?
why is snow white?
Why isn't there a taxi today at the station?
Why do you clean the house every week?
Why don't we have enough food for everyone?
Why do you want to do this?
Why are you in such a hurry?
I have a chocolatier in the village.
I'd rather have a cat than a dog.

She can swim very fast.
Can you see the difference?
Can you teach me how to do that?
Can you imagine what our life would be like without electricity?
Can you imagine the situation?
Can you stay a little longer?
Can you remember the first time you ate at this restaurant?
I can say it over and over again.
Since I was sick for a week, I do my best to recover.
What?
Staying home isn't fun.
What do you think I can do for Tom?
What are you looking at?
What did Mari buy yesterday?
How beautiful she is!
What are you doing?
What have you done with the car?
What's for dinner?
What a beautiful city!
Which do you prefer, plum cake or apple cake?
Do you want another piece of pudding?
What does this mean?
What did you use at the party?
How big is your family?
What do I have to do to get your attention?
What kind of wine does he have?
What kind of vegetables do you want to buy?
Who's taller, Ken or Taro?
Who invented the telephone? Bell or Meucci?
Who speaks English?
Who complained?
Who am I and who are you?
Who told you that?
Who taught you how to dance?
Do you want me to come to Japan to see you?
I want you to say what you think.
I want you to go.
I wanna travel with you.
I'd like to learn to play banjo.
I'd like to be an English teacher.
You're a really good guitarist.
Can you make bread?
Do you know who she is?
Be brave.
She took a bath and got dressed.
He went to America.
I'm getting my feet cold.
Sit down there.
They forgot to wake me.
I know Tom lied.
I know you know.
I know you're a teacher.
You'd better see the doctor.
Be brave.
Yeah, this is Anthony.
We always throw a party for his birthday.
If you're tired, go to bed.
Wild can see the stork in the park.
If you want to know how a certain word is used, look it up in this dictionary.
If you keep drinking like this, you'll be drunk very soon.
You're two years younger than Tom.
I used to think the Earth was flat.
I just wanna find out what happened.
He smiled.
I'm gay.
I'm the tallest in the class.
I'm deaf, and I can't hear you.
